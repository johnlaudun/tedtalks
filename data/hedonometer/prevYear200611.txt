                Thank you so much  Chris. And it's truly a great honor to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice  I'm extremely grateful. I have been blown away by this conference  and I want to thank all of you for the many nice comments about what I had to say the other night. And I say that sincerely  partly because  Mock sob  I need that. Put yourselves in my position. I flew on Air Force Two for eight years. Now I have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane  I'll tell you one quick story to illustrate what that's been like for me. It's a true story    every bit of this is true. Soon after Tipper and I left the     Mock sob  White House    we were driving from our home in Nashville to a little farm we have    miles east of Nashville. Driving ourselves. I know it sounds like a little thing to you  but    I looked in the rear view mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me. There was no motorcade back there. You've heard of phantom limb pain  This was a rented Ford Taurus. It was dinnertime  and we started looking for a place to eat. We were on I   . We got to Exit      Lebanon  Tennessee. We got off the exit  we found a Shoney's restaurant. Low cost family restaurant chain  for those of you who don't know it. We went in and sat down at the booth  and the waitress came over  made a big commotion over Tipper. She took our order  and then went to the couple in the booth next to us  and she lowered her voice so much  I had to really strain to hear what she was saying. And she said  Yes  that's former Vice President Al Gore and his wife  Tipper.  And the man said   He's come down a long way  hasn't he   There's been kind of a series of epiphanies. The very next day  continuing the totally true story  I got on a G V to fly to Africa to make a speech in Nigeria  in the city of Lagos  on the topic of energy. And I began the speech by telling them the story of what had just happened the day before in Nashville. And I told it pretty much the same way I've just shared it with you  Tipper and I were driving ourselves  Shoney's  low cost family restaurant chain  what the man said    they laughed. I gave my speech  then went back out to the airport to fly back home. I fell asleep on the plane until  during the middle of the night  we landed on the Azores Islands for refueling. I woke up  they opened the door  I went out to get some fresh air  and I looked  and there was a man running across the runway. And he was waving a piece of paper  and he was yelling   Call Washington  Call Washington   And I thought to myself  in the middle of the night  in the middle of the Atlantic  what in the world could be wrong in Washington  Then I remembered it could be a bunch of things. But what it turned out to be  was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services in Nigeria had already written a story about my speech  and it had already been printed in cities all across the United States of America. It was printed in Monterey  I checked. And the story began   Former Vice President Al Gore announced in Nigeria yesterday   quote  'My wife Tipper and I have opened a low cost family restaurant'      'named Shoney's  and we are running it ourselves.'  Before I could get back to U.S. soil  David Letterman and Jay Leno had already started in on    one of them had me in a big white chef's hat  Tipper was saying   One more burger with fries   Three days later  I got a nice  long  handwritten letter from my friend and partner and colleague Bill Clinton  saying   Congratulations on the new restaurant  Al   We like to celebrate each other's successes in life. I was going to talk about information ecology. But I was thinking that  since I plan to make a lifelong habit of coming back to TED  that maybe I could talk about that another time. Chris Anderson  It's a deal  Al Gore  I want to focus on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on  What can you do about the climate crisis  I want to start with a couple of    I'm going to show some new images  and I'm going to recapitulate just four or five. Now  the slide show. I update the slide show every time I give it. I add new images  because I learn more about it every time I give it. It's like beach combing  you know  Every time the tide comes in and out  you find some more shells. Just in the last two days  we got the new temperature records in January. This is just for the United States of America. Historical average for Januarys is    degrees  last month was   .  degrees. Now  I know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment    I'm kidding. But these are the recapitulation slides  and then I'm going to go into new material about what you can do. But I wanted to elaborate on a couple of these. First of all  this is where we're projected to go with the U.S. contribution to global warming  under business as usual. Efficiency in end use electricity and end use of all energy is the low hanging fruit. Efficiency and conservation    it's not a cost  it's a profit. The sign is wrong. It's not negative  it's positive. These are investments that pay for themselves. But they are also very effective in deflecting our path. Cars and trucks    I talked about that in the slideshow  but I want you to put it in perspective. It's an easy  visible target of concern    and it should be    but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks. Cars and trucks are very significant  and we have the lowest standards in the world. And so we should address that. But it's part of the puzzle. Other transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks. Renewables at the current levels of technological efficiency can make this much difference. And with what Vinod  and John Doerr and others  many of you here    there are a lot of people directly involved in this    this wedge is going to grow much more rapidly than the current projection shows it. Carbon Capture and Sequestration    that's what CCS stands for    is likely to become the killer app that will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe. Not quite there yet. OK. Now  what can you do  Reduce emissions in your home. Most of these expenditures are also profitable. Insulation  better design. Buy green electricity where you can. I mentioned automobiles    buy a hybrid. Use light rail. Figure out some of the other options that are much better. It's important. Be a green consumer. You have choices with everything you buy  between things that have a harsh effect  or a much less harsh effect on the global climate crisis. Consider this  Make a decision to live a carbon neutral life. Those of you who are good at branding  I'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people. It is easier than you think. It really is. A lot of us in here have made that decision  and it is really pretty easy. It means reduce your carbon dioxide emissions with the full range of choices that you make  and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not completely reduced. And what it means is elaborated at climatecrisis.net. There is a carbon calculator. Participant Productions convened    with my active involvement    the leading software writers in the world  on this arcane science of carbon calculation  to construct a consumer friendly carbon calculator. You can very precisely calculate what your CO  emissions are  and then you will be given options to reduce. And by the time the movie comes out in May  this will be updated to  .   and we will have click through purchases of offsets. Next  consider making your business carbon neutral. Again  some of us have done that  and it's not as hard as you think. Integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations  whether you are from the technology  or entertainment  or design and architecture community. Invest sustainably. Majora mentioned this. Listen  if you have invested money with managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance  don't ever again complain about quarterly report CEO management. Over time  people do what you pay them to do. And if they judge how much they're going to get paid on your capital that they've invested  based on the short term returns  you're going to get short term decisions. A lot more to be said about that. Become a catalyst of change. Teach others  learn about it  talk about it. The movie is a movie version of the slideshow I gave two nights ago  except it's a lot more entertaining. And it comes out in May. Many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it. Consider sending somebody to Nashville. Pick well. And I am personally going to train people to give this slideshow    re purposed  with some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach  and it's not just the slides  it's what they mean. And it's how they link together. And so I'm going to be conducting a course this summer for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse  in communities all across the country  and we're going to update the slideshow for all of them every single week  to keep it right on the cutting edge. Working with Larry Lessig  it will be  somewhere in that process  posted with tools and limited use copyrights  so that young people can remix it and do it in their own way. Where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay arm's length from politics  It doesn't mean that if you're a Republican  that I'm trying to convince you to be a Democrat. We need Republicans as well. This used to be a bipartisan issue  and I know that in this group it really is. Become politically active. Make our democracy work the way it's supposed to work. Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions    global warming pollution    and trading it. Here's why  as long as the United States is out of the world system  it's not a closed system. Once it becomes a closed system  with U.S. participation  then everybody who's on a board of directors    how many people here serve on the board of directors of a corporation  Once it's a closed system  you will have legal liability if you do not urge your CEO to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided. The market will work to solve this problem    if we can accomplish this. Help with the mass persuasion campaign that will start this spring. We have to change the minds of the American people. Because presently  the politicians do not have permission to do what needs to be done. And in our modern country  the role of logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power the way it once did. It's now repetition of short  hot button     second     second television ads. We have to buy a lot of those ads. Let's re brand global warming  as many of you have suggested. I like  climate crisis  instead of  climate collapse   but again  those of you who are good at branding  I need your help on this. Somebody said the test we're facing now  a scientist told me  is whether the combination of an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination. That's really true. I said the other night  and I'll repeat now  this is not a political issue. Again  the Republicans here    this shouldn't be partisan. You have more influence than some of us who are Democrats do. This is an opportunity. Not just this  but connected to the ideas that are here  to bring more coherence to them. We are one. Thank you very much  I appreciate it. Hello voice mail  my old friend. I've called for tech support again. I ignored my boss's warning. I called on a Monday morning. Now it's evening  and my dinner first grew cold  and then grew mold. I'm still on hold. I'm listening to the sounds of silence. I don't think you understand. I think your phone lines are unmanned. I punched every touch tone I was told  but I've still spent    hours on hold. It's not enough your software crashed my Mac  and it constantly hangs and bombs    it erased my ROMs  Now the Mac makes the sounds of silence. In my dreams I fantasize of wreaking vengeance on you guys. Say your motorcycle crashes. Blood comes gushing from your gashes. With your fading strength  you call       and you pray for a trained MD. But you get me. And you listen to the sounds of silence. Thank you. Good evening and welcome to   Spot the TED Presenter Who Used to Be a Broadway Accompanist.  When I was offered the Times column six years ago  the deal was like this  you'll be sent the coolest  hottest  slickest new gadgets. Every week  it'll arrive at your door. You get to try them out  play with them  evaluate them until the novelty wears out  before you have to send them back  and you'll get paid for it. You can think about it  if you want. So  I've always been a technology nut  and I absolutely love it. The job  though  came with one small downside  and that is  they intended to publish my email address at the end of every column. And what I've noticed is    first of all  you get an incredible amount of email. If you ever are feeling lonely  get a New York Times column  because you will get hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of emails. And the email I'm getting a lot today is about frustration. People are feeling like things    Ok  I just had an alarm come up on my screen. Lucky you can't see it. People are feeling overwhelmed. They're feeling like it's too much technology  too fast. It may be good technology  but I feel like there's not enough of a support structure. There's not enough help. There's not enough thought put into the design of it to make it easy and enjoyable to use. One time I wrote a column about my efforts to reach Dell Technical Support  and within    hours  there were     messages from readers on the feedback boards on the Times website  from users saying    Me too  and here's my tale of woe.  I call it  software rage.  And man  let me tell you  whoever figures out how to make money off of this frustration will    Oh  how did that get up there  Just kidding. Ok  so why is the problem accelerating  And part of the problem is  ironically  because the industry has put so much thought into making things easier to use. I'll show you what I mean. This is what the computer interface used to look like  DOS. Over the years  it's gotten easier to use. This is the original Mac operating system. Reagan was President. Madonna was still a brunette. And the entire operating system    this is the good part    the entire operating system fit in     k. You couldn't put the Mac OS X logo in     k  So the irony is  that as these things became easier to use  a less technical  broader audience was coming into contact with this equipment for the first time. I once had the distinct privilege of sitting in on the Apple call center for a day. The guy had a duplicate headset for me to listen to. And the calls that    you know how they say   Your call may be recorded for quality assurance   Uh uh. Your call may be recorded so that they can collect the funniest dumb user stories and pass them around on a CD. Which they do. And I have a copy. It's in your gift bag. No  no. With your voices on it  So  some of the stories are just so classic  and yet so understandable. A woman called Apple to complain that her mouse was squeaking. Making a squeaking noise. And the technician said   Well  ma'am  what do you mean your mouse is squeaking   She says   All I can tell you is that it squeaks louder  the faster I move it across the screen.  And the technician's like   Ma'am  you've got the mouse up against the screen   She goes   Well  the message said  'Click here to continue.'  Well  if you like that one    how much time have we got  Another one  a guy called    this is absolutely true    his computer had crashed  and he told the technician he couldn't restart it  no matter how many times he typed    .  And the technician said   What  Why are you typing      He said   The message says  'Error Type   .'  So  we must admit that some of the blame falls squarely at the feet of the users. But why is the technical overload crisis  the complexity crisis  accelerating now  In the hardware world  it's because we the consumers want everything to be smaller  smaller  smaller. So the gadgets are getting tinier and tinier  but our fingers are essentially staying the same size. So it gets to be more and more of a challenge. Software is subject to another primal force  the mandate to release more and more versions. When you buy a piece of software  it's not like buying a vase or a candy bar  where you own it. It's more like joining a club  where you pay dues every year  and every year  they say   We've added more features  and we'll sell it to you for    .  I know one guy who's spent        just on Photoshop over the years. And software companies make    percent of their revenue from just these software upgrades. I call it the Software Upgrade Paradox    which is that if you improve a piece of software enough times  you eventually ruin it. I mean  Microsoft Word was last just a word processor in  you know  the Eisenhower administration. But what's the alternative  Microsoft actually did this experiment. They said   Well  wait a minute. Everyone complains that we're adding so many features. Let's create a word processor that's just a word processor  Simple  pure  does not do web pages  is not a database.  And it came out  and it was called Microsoft Write. And none of you are nodding in acknowledgment  because it died. It tanked. No one ever bought it. I call this the Sport Utility Principle. People like to surround themselves with unnecessary power  right  They don't need the database and the website  but they're like   Well  I'll upgrade  because  I might  you know  I might need that someday.  So the problem is  as you add more features  where are they going to go  Where are you going to stick them  You only have so many design tools. You can do buttons  you can do sliders  pop up menus  sub menus. But if you're not careful about how you choose  you wind up with this. This is an un retouched    this is not a joke    un retouched photo of Microsoft Word  the copy that you have  with all the toolbars open. You've obviously never opened all the toolbars  but all you have to type in is this little  teeny window down here. And we've arrived at the age of interface matrices  where there are so many features and options  you have to do two dimensions  you know  a vertical and a horizontal. You guys all complain about how Microsoft Word is always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically. The off switch is in there somewhere. I'm telling you    it's there. Part of the art of designing a simple  good interface  is knowing when to use which one of these features. So  here is the log off dialogue box for Windows     . There are only four choices  so why are they in a pop up menu  It's not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components that you need to collapse the choices. They could have put them all out in view. Here's Apple's take on the exact same dialogue box. Thank you    yes  I designed the dialogue box. No  no. Already  we can see that Apple and Microsoft have a severely divergent approach to software design. Microsoft's approach to simplicity tends to be  let's break it down  let's just make it more steps. There are these  wizards  everywhere. And you know  there's a new version of Windows coming out this fall. If they continue at this pace  there's absolutely no telling where they might wind up.  Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard   Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard.  Ok  I'll bite. Let's click  Next  to continue. From the drop down menu  choose the first letter you want to type. Ok. So there is a limit that we don't want to cross. So what is the answer  How do you pack in all these features in a simple  intelligent way  I believe in consistency  when possible  real world equivalents  trash can folder  when possible  label things  mostly. But I beg of the designers here to break all those rules if they violate the biggest rule of all  which is intelligence. Now what do I mean by that  I'm going to give you some examples where intelligence makes something not consistent  but it's better. If you are buying something on the web  you're supposed to put in your address  and you're supposed to choose what country you're from  ok  There are     countries in the world. We like to think of the Internet as a global village. I'm sorry  it's not one yet. It's mainly like  the United States  Europe  and Japan. So why is  United States  in the  U s  You have to scroll  like  seven screensful to get to it. Now  it would be inconsistent to put  United States  first  but it would be intelligent. This one's been touched on before  but why in God's name do you shut down a Windows PC by clicking a button called  Start   Here's another pet one of mine  you have a printer. Most of the time  you want to print one copy of your document  in page order  on that printer. So why in God's name do you see this every time you print  It's like a     shuttle cockpit. And one of the buttons at the bottom  you'll notice  is not  Print.  Now  I'm not saying that Apple is the only company who has embraced the cult of simplicity. Palm is also  especially in the old days  wonderful about this. I actually got to speak to Palm when they were flying high in the '  s  and after the talk  I met one of the employees. He says   Nice talk.  And I said   Thank you. What do you do here   He said   I'm a tap counter.  I'm like   You're a what   He goes   Well Jeff Hawkins  the CEO  says  'If any task on the Palm Pilot takes more than three taps of the stylus  it's too long  and it has to be redesigned.' So I'm the tap counter.  So  I'm going to show you an example of a company that does not have a tap counter. This is Microsoft Word. Ok  when you want to create a new blank document in Word    it could happen. You go up to the  File  menu and you choose  New.  Now  what happens when you choose  New   Do you get a new blank document  You do not. On the opposite side of the monitor  a task bar appears  and somewhere in those links    by the way  not at the top    somewhere in those links is a button that makes you a new document. Ok  so that is a company not counting taps. You know  I don't want to just stand here and make fun of Microsoft ... Yes  I do. The Bill Gates song  I've been a geek forever and I wrote the very first DOS. I put my software and IBM together  I got profit and they got the loss. I write the code that makes the whole world run. I'm getting royalties from everyone. Sometimes it's garbage  but the press is snowed. You buy the box  I'll sell the code. Every software company is doing Microsoft's R D. You can't keep a good idea down these days. Even Windows is a hack. We're kind of based loosely on the Mac. So it's big  so it's slow. You've got nowhere to go. I'm not doing this for praise. I write the code that fits the world today. Big mediocrity in every way. We've entered planet domination mode. You'll have no choice  you'll buy my code. I am Bill Gates and I write the code. But actually  I believe there are really two Microsofts. There's the old one  responsible for Windows and Office. They're dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh  but they can't. They're locked in  because so many add ons and other company stuff locks into the old      chassis. But there's also a new Microsoft  that's really doing good  simple interface designs. I liked the Media Center PC. I liked the Microsoft SPOT Watch. The Wireless Watch flopped miserably in the market  but it wasn't because it wasn't simply and beautifully designed. But let's put it this way  would you pay     a month to have a watch that has to be recharged every night like your cell phone  and stops working when you leave your area code  So  the signs might indicate that the complexity crunch is only going to get worse. So is there any hope  The screens are getting smaller  people are illuminating  putting manuals in the boxes  things are coming out at a faster pace. It's funny    when Steve Jobs came back to Apple in       after    years away  it was the MacWorld Expo    he came to the stage in that black turtleneck and jeans  and he sort of did this. The crowd went wild  but I had just seen    I'm like  where have I seen this before  I had just seen the movie  Evita     with Madonna  and I'm like  you know what  I've got to do one about Steve Jobs. It won't be easy. You'll think I'm strange. When I try to explain why I'm back  after telling the press Apple's future is black. You won't believe me. All that you see is a kid in his teens who started out in a garage with only a buddy named Woz. You try rhyming with garage  Don't cry for me  Cupertino. The truth is  I never left you. I know the ropes now  know what the tricks are. I made a fortune over at Pixar. Don't cry for me  Cupertino. I've still got the drive and vision. I still wear sandals in any weather. It's just that these days  they're Gucci leather. Thank you. So Steve Jobs had always believed in simplicity and elegance and beauty. And the truth is  for years I was a little depressed  because Americans obviously did not value it  because the Mac had three percent market share  Windows had    percent market share    people did not think it was worth putting a price on it. So I was a little depressed. And then I heard Al Gore's talk  and I realized I didn't know the meaning of depressed. But it turns out I was wrong  right  Because the iPod came out  and it violated every bit of common wisdom. Other products cost less  other products had more features  they had voice recorders and FM transmitters. The other products were backed by Microsoft  with an open standard  not Apple's propriety standard. But the iPod won    this is the one they wanted. The lesson was  simplicity sells. And there are signs that the industry is getting the message. This is a little company that's done very well with simplicity and elegance. The Sonos thing    it's catching on. I've got just a couple examples. Physically  a really cool  elegant thinking coming along lately. When you have a digital camera  how do you get the pictures back to your computer  Well  you either haul around a USB cable  or you buy a card reader and haul that around. Either one  you're going to lose. What I do is  I take out the memory card  and I fold it in half  revealing USB contacts. I just stick it in the computer  offload the pictures  put it right back in the camera. I never have to lose anything. Here's another example. Chris  you're the source of all power. Will you be my power plug  Chris Anderson  Oh yeah. DP  Hold that and don't let go. You might've seen this  this is Apple's new laptop. This the power cord. It hooks on like this. And I'm sure every one of you has done this at some point in your lives  or one of your children. You walk along    and I'm about to pull this onto the floor. I don't care. It's a loaner. Here we go. Whoa  It's magnetic    it doesn't pull the laptop onto the floor. In my very last example    I do a lot of my work using speech recognition software. And I'll just    you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous. Speech recognition software is really great for doing emails very quickly  period. Like  I get hundreds of them a day  period. And it's not just what I dictate that it writes down  period. I also use this feature called voice macros  period. Correct  dissuade.  Not  just.  Ok  this is not an ideal situation  because it's getting the echo from the hall and stuff. The point is  I can respond to people very quickly by saying a short word  and having it write out a much longer thing. So if somebody sends me a fan letter  I'll say   Thanks for that.   Thank you so much for taking the time to write ...  And conversely  if somebody sends me hate mail    which happens daily    I say   Piss off.   I admire your frankness ...  So that's my dirty little secret. Don't tell anyone. So the point is    this is a really interesting story. This is version eight of this software  and do you know what they put in version eight  No new features. It's never happened before in software  The company put no new features. They just said   We'll make this software work right.  Right  Because for years  people had bought this software  tried it out       percent accuracy was all they got  which means one in    words is wrong    and they'd put it in their drawer. And the company got sick of that  so they said   This version  we're not going to do anything  but make sure it's darned accurate.  And so that's what they did. This cult of doing things right is starting to spread. So  my final advice for those of you who are consumers of this technology  remember  if it doesn't work  it's not necessarily you  ok  It could be the design of the thing you're using. Be aware in life of good design and bad design. And if you're among the people who create this stuff  Easy is hard. Pre sweat the details for your audience. Count the taps. Remember  the hard part is not deciding what features to add  it's deciding what to leave out. And best of all  your motivation is  simplicity sells. CA  Bravo. DP  Thank you very much. CA  Hear  hear  If you're here today    and I'm very happy that you are    you've all heard about how sustainable development will save us from ourselves. However  when we're not at TED  we are often told that a real sustainability policy agenda is just not feasible  especially in large urban areas like New York City. And that's because most people with decision making powers  in both the public and the private sector  really don't feel as though they're in danger. The reason why I'm here today  in part  is because of a dog    an abandoned puppy I found back in the rain  back in     . She turned out to be a much bigger dog than I'd anticipated. When she came into my life  we were fighting against a huge waste facility planned for the East River waterfront despite the fact that our small part of New York City already handled more than    percent of the entire city's commercial waste  a sewage treatment pelletizing plant  a sewage sludge plant  four power plants  the world's largest food distribution center  as well as other industries that bring more than        diesel truck trips to the area each week. The area also has one of the lowest ratios of parks to people in the city. So when I was contacted by the Parks Department about a         seed grant initiative to help develop waterfront projects  I thought they were really well meaning  but a bit naive. I'd lived in this area all my life  and you could not get to the river  because of all the lovely facilities that I mentioned earlier. Then  while jogging with my dog one morning  she pulled me into what I thought was just another illegal dump. There were weeds and piles of garbage and other stuff that I won't mention here  but she kept dragging me  and lo and behold  at the end of that lot was the river. I knew that this forgotten little street end  abandoned like the dog that brought me there  was worth saving. And I knew it would grow to become the proud beginnings of the community led revitalization of the new South Bronx. And just like my new dog  it was an idea that got bigger than I'd imagined. We garnered much support along the way  and the Hunts Point Riverside Park became the first waterfront park that the South Bronx had had in more than    years. We leveraged that         seed grant more than     times  into a    million park. And in the fall  I'm going to exchange marriage vows with my beloved. Thank you very much. That's him pressing my buttons back there  which he does all the time. But those of us living in environmental justice communities are the canary in the coal mine. We feel the problems right now  and have for some time. Environmental justice  for those of you who may not be familiar with the term  goes something like this  no community should be saddled with more environmental burdens and less environmental benefits than any other. Unfortunately  race and class are extremely reliable indicators as to where one might find the good stuff  like parks and trees  and where one might find the bad stuff  like power plants and waste facilities. As a black person in America  I am twice as likely as a white person to live in an area where air pollution poses the greatest risk to my health. I am five times more likely to live within walking distance of a power plant or chemical facility  which I do. These land use decisions created the hostile conditions that lead to problems like obesity  diabetes and asthma. Why would someone leave their home to go for a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood  Our    percent obesity rate is high even for this country  and diabetes comes with it. One out of four South Bronx children has asthma. Our asthma hospitalization rate is seven times higher than the national average. These impacts are coming everyone's way. And we all pay dearly for solid waste costs  health problems associated with pollution and more odiously  the cost of imprisoning our young black and Latino men  who possess untold amounts of untapped potential. Fifty percent of our residents live at or below the poverty line     percent of us are unemployed. Low income citizens often use emergency room visits as primary care. This comes at a high cost to taxpayers and produces no proportional benefits. Poor people are not only still poor  they are still unhealthy. Fortunately  there are many people like me who are striving for solutions that won't compromise the lives of low income communities of color in the short term  and won't destroy us all in the long term. None of us want that  and we all have that in common. So what else do we have in common  Well  first of all  we're all incredibly good looking. Graduated high school  college  post graduate degrees  traveled to interesting places  didn't have kids in your early teens  financially stable  never been imprisoned. OK. Good. But  besides being a black woman  I am different from most of you in some other ways. I watched nearly half of the buildings in my neighborhood burn down. My big brother Lenny fought in Vietnam  only to be gunned down a few blocks from our home. Jesus. I grew up with a crack house across the street. Yeah  I'm a poor black child from the ghetto. These things make me different from you. But the things we have in common set me apart from most of the people in my community  and I am in between these two worlds with enough of my heart to fight for justice in the other. So how did things get so different for us  In the late '  s  my dad    a Pullman porter  son of a slave    bought a house in the Hunts Point section of the South Bronx  and a few years later  he married my mom. At the time  the community was a mostly white  working class neighborhood. My dad was not alone. And as others like him pursued their own version of the American dream  white flight became common in the South Bronx and in many cities around the country. Red lining was used by banks  wherein certain sections of the city  including ours  were deemed off limits to any sort of investment. Many landlords believed it was more profitable to torch their buildings and collect insurance money rather than to sell under those conditions    dead or injured former tenants notwithstanding. Hunts Point was formerly a walk to work community  but now residents had neither work nor home to walk to. A national highway construction boom was added to our problems. In New York State  Robert Moses spearheaded an aggressive highway expansion campaign. One of its primary goals was to make it easier for residents of wealthy communities in Westchester County to go to Manhattan. The South Bronx  which lies in between  did not stand a chance. Residents were often given less than a month's notice before their buildings were razed.         people were displaced. The common perception was that only pimps and pushers and prostitutes were from the South Bronx. And if you are told from your earliest days that nothing good is going to come from your community  that it's bad and ugly  how could it not reflect on you  So now  my family's property was worthless  save for that it was our home  and all we had. And luckily for me  that home and the love inside of it  along with help from teachers  mentors and friends along the way  was enough. Now  why is this story important  Because from a planning perspective  economic degradation begets environmental degradation  which begets social degradation. The disinvestment that began in the     s set the stage for all the environmental injustices that were to come. Antiquated zoning and land use regulations are still used to this day to continue putting polluting facilities in my neighborhood. Are these factors taken into consideration when land use policy is decided  What costs are associated with these decisions  And who pays  Who profits  Does anything justify what the local community goes through  This was  planning     in quotes    that did not have our best interests in mind. Once we realized that  we decided it was time to do our own planning. That small park I told you about earlier was the first stage of building a Greenway movement in the South Bronx. I wrote a one and a quarter million dollar federal transportation grant to design the plan for a waterfront esplanade with dedicated on street bike paths. Physical improvements help inform public policy regarding traffic safety  the placement of the waste and other facilities  which  if done properly  don't compromise a community's quality of life. They provide opportunities to be more physically active  as well as local economic development. Think bike shops  juice stands. We secured    million dollars to build first phase projects. This is Lafayette Avenue    and that's redesigned by Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects. And once this path is constructed  it'll connect the South Bronx with more than     acres of Randall's Island Park. Right now we're separated by about    feet of water  but this link will change that. As we nurture the natural environment  its abundance will give us back even more. We run a project called the Bronx  Environmental  Stewardship Training  which provides job training in the fields of ecological restoration  so that folks from our community have the skills to compete for these well paying jobs. Little by little  we're seeding the area with green collar jobs    and with people that have both a financial and personal stake in their environment. The Sheridan Expressway is an underutilized relic of the Robert Moses era  built with no regard for the neighborhoods that were divided by it. Even during rush hour  it goes virtually unused. The community created an alternative transportation plan that allows for the removal of the highway. We have the opportunity now to bring together all the stakeholders to re envision how this    acres can be better utilized for parkland  affordable housing and local economic development. We also built New York City's first green and cool roof demonstration project on top of our offices. Cool roofs are highly reflective surfaces that don't absorb solar heat  and pass it on to the building or atmosphere. Green roofs are soil and living plants. Both can be used instead of petroleum based roofing materials that absorb heat  contribute to urban  heat island  effect and degrade under the sun  which we in turn breathe. Green roofs also retain up to    percent of rainfall  so they reduce a city's need to fund costly end of pipe solutions    which  incidentally  are often located in environmental justice communities like mine. And they provide habitats for our little friends   Butterfly  So cool  Anyway  the demonstration project is a springboard for our own green roof installation business  bringing jobs and sustainable economic activity to the South Bronx.  Green is the new black ...  I like that  too. Anyway  I know Chris told us not to do pitches up here  but since I have all of your attention  We need investors. End of pitch. It's better to ask for forgiveness than permission. Anyway    OK. Katrina. Prior to Katrina  the South Bronx and New Orleans' Ninth Ward had a lot in common. Both were largely populated by poor people of color  both hotbeds of cultural innovation  think hip hop and jazz. Both are waterfront communities that host both industries and residents in close proximity of one another. In the post Katrina era  we have still more in common. We're at best ignored  and maligned and abused  at worst  by negligent regulatory agencies  pernicious zoning and lax governmental accountability. Neither the destruction of the Ninth Ward nor the South Bronx was inevitable. But we have emerged with valuable lessons about how to dig ourselves out. We are more than simply national symbols of urban blight or problems to be solved by empty campaign promises of presidents come and gone. Now will we let the Gulf Coast languish for a decade or two  like the South Bronx did  Or will we take proactive steps and learn from the homegrown resource of grassroots activists that have been born of desperation in communities like mine  Now listen  I do not expect individuals  corporations or government to make the world a better place because it is right or moral. This presentation today only represents some of what I've been through. Like a tiny little bit. You've no clue. But I'll tell you later  if you want to know. But    I know it's the bottom line  or one's perception of it  that motivates people in the end. I'm interested in what I like to call the  triple bottom line  that sustainable development can produce. Developments that have the potential to create positive returns for all concerned  the developers  government and the community where these projects go up. At present  that's not happening in New York City. And we are operating with a comprehensive urban planning deficit. A parade of government subsidies is going to propose big box and stadium developments in the South Bronx  but there is scant coordination between city agencies on how to deal with the cumulative effects of increased traffic  pollution  solid waste and the impacts on open space. And their approaches to local economic and job development are so lame it's not even funny. Because on top of that  the world's richest sports team is replacing the House That Ruth Built by destroying two well loved community parks. Now  we'll have even less than that stat I told you about earlier. And although less than    percent of South Bronx residents own cars  these projects include thousands of new parking spaces  yet zip in terms of mass public transit. Now  what's missing from the larger debate is a comprehensive cost benefit analysis between not fixing an unhealthy  environmentally challenged community  versus incorporating structural  sustainable changes. My agency is working closely with Columbia University and others to shine a light on these issues. Now let's get this straight  I am not anti development. Ours is a city  not a wilderness preserve. And I've embraced my inner capitalist. And  but I don't have    You probably all have  and if you haven't  you need to. So I don't have a problem with developers making money. There's enough precedent out there to show that a sustainable  community friendly development can still make a fortune. Fellow TEDsters Bill McDonough and Amory Lovins    both heroes of mine by the way    have shown that you can actually do that. I do have a problem with developments that hyper exploit politically vulnerable communities for profit. That it continues is a shame upon us all  because we are all responsible for the future that we create. But one of the things I do to remind myself of greater possibilities  is to learn from visionaries in other cities. This is my version of globalization. Let's take Bogota. Poor  Latino  surrounded by runaway gun violence and drug trafficking  a reputation not unlike that of the South Bronx. However  this city was blessed in the late     s with a highly influential mayor named Enrique Pe alosa. He looked at the demographics. Few Bogotanos own cars  yet a huge portion of the city's resources was dedicated to serving them. If you're a mayor  you can do something about that. His administration narrowed key municipal thoroughfares from five lanes to three  outlawed parking on those streets  expanded pedestrian walkways and bike lanes  created public plazas  created one of the most efficient bus mass transit systems in the entire world. For his brilliant efforts  he was nearly impeached. But as people began to see that they were being put first on issues reflecting their day to day lives  incredible things happened. People stopped littering. Crime rates dropped  because the streets were alive with people. His administration attacked several typical urban problems at one time  and on a third world budget  at that. We have no excuse in this country  I'm sorry. But the bottom line is  their people first agenda was not meant to penalize those who could actually afford cars  but rather  to provide opportunities for all Bogotanos to participate in the city's resurgence. That development should not come at the expense of the majority of the population is still considered a radical idea here in the U.S. But Bogota's example has the power to change that. You  however  are blessed with the gift of influence. That's why you're here and why you value the information we exchange. Use your influence in support of comprehensive  sustainable change everywhere. Don't just talk about it at TED. This is a nationwide policy agenda I'm trying to build  and as you all know  politics are personal. Help me make green the new black. Help me make sustainability sexy. Make it a part of your dinner and cocktail conversations. Help me fight for environmental and economic justice. Support investments with a triple bottom line return. Help me democratize sustainability by bringing everyone to the table  and insisting that comprehensive planning can be addressed everywhere. Oh good  glad I have a little more time  Listen    when I spoke to Mr. Gore the other day after breakfast  I asked him how environmental justice activists were going to be included in his new marketing strategy. His response was a grant program. I don't think he understood that I wasn't asking for funding. I was making him an offer. What troubled me was that this top down approach is still around. Now  don't get me wrong  we need money. But grassroots groups are needed at the table during the decision making process. Of the    percent of the energy that Mr. Gore reminded us that we waste every day  don't add wasting our energy  intelligence and hard earned experience to that count. I have come from so far to meet you like this. Please don't waste me. By working together  we can become one of those small  rapidly growing groups of individuals who actually have the audacity and courage to believe that we actually can change the world. We might have come to this conference from very  very different stations in life  but believe me  we all share one incredibly powerful thing. We have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Ciao  bellos  Good morning. How are you  It's been great  hasn't it  I've been blown away by the whole thing. In fact  I'm leaving. There have been three themes running through the conference which are relevant to what I want to talk about. One is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that we've had and in all of the people here. Just the variety of it and the range of it. The second is that it's put us in a place where we have no idea what's going to happen  in terms of the future. No idea how this may play out. I have an interest in education. Actually  what I find is everybody has an interest in education. Don't you  I find this very interesting. If you're at a dinner party  and you say you work in education    Actually  you're not often at dinner parties  frankly. If you work in education  you're not asked. And you're never asked back  curiously. That's strange to me. But if you are  and you say to somebody  you know  they say   What do you do   and you say you work in education  you can see the blood run from their face. They're like   Oh my God   you know   Why me    My one night out all week.  But if you ask about their education  they pin you to the wall. Because it's one of those things that goes deep with people  am I right  Like religion  and money and other things. So I have a big interest in education  and I think we all do. We have a huge vested interest in it  partly because it's education that's meant to take us into this future that we can't grasp. If you think of it  children starting school this year will be retiring in     . Nobody has a clue  despite all the expertise that's been on parade for the past four days  what the world will look like in five years' time. And yet we're meant to be educating them for it. So the unpredictability  I think  is extraordinary. And the third part of this is that we've all agreed  nonetheless  on the really extraordinary capacities that children have    their capacities for innovation. I mean  Sirena last night was a marvel  wasn't she  Just seeing what she could do. And she's exceptional  but I think she's not  so to speak  exceptional in the whole of childhood. What you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent. And my contention is  all kids have tremendous talents. And we squander them  pretty ruthlessly. So I want to talk about education and I want to talk about creativity. My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy  and we should treat it with the same status. That was it  by the way. Thank you very much. So     minutes left. Well  I was born... no. I heard a great story recently    I love telling it    of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson. She was six  and she was at the back  drawing  and the teacher said this girl hardly ever paid attention  and in this drawing lesson  she did. The teacher was fascinated. She went over to her  and she said   What are you drawing   And the girl said   I'm drawing a picture of God.  And the teacher said   But nobody knows what God looks like.  And the girl said   They will  in a minute.  When my son was four in England    Actually  he was four everywhere  to be honest. If we're being strict about it  wherever he went  he was four that year. He was in the Nativity play. Do you remember the story  No  it was big  it was a big story. Mel Gibson did the sequel  you may have seen it.  Nativity II.  But James got the part of Joseph  which we were thrilled about. We considered this to be one of the lead parts. We had the place crammed full of agents in T shirts   James Robinson IS Joseph    Laughter  He didn't have to speak  but you know the bit where the three kings come in  They come in bearing gifts  gold  frankincense and myrrh. This really happened. We were sitting there and I think they just went out of sequence  because we talked to the little boy afterward and we said   You OK with that   And he said   Yeah  why  Was that wrong   They just switched. The three boys came in  four year olds with tea towels on their heads  and they put these boxes down  and the first boy said   I bring you gold.  And the second boy said   I bring you myrrh.  And the third boy said   Frank sent this.  What these things have in common is that kids will take a chance. If they don't know  they'll have a go. Am I right  They're not frightened of being wrong. I don't mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative. What we do know is  if you're not prepared to be wrong  you'll never come up with anything original    if you're not prepared to be wrong. And by the time they get to be adults  most kids have lost that capacity. They have become frightened of being wrong. And we run our companies like this. We stigmatize mistakes. And we're now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make. And the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities. Picasso once said this  he said that all children are born artists. The problem is to remain an artist as we grow up. I believe this passionately  that we don't grow into creativity  we grow out of it. Or rather  we get educated out of it. So why is this  I lived in Stratford on Avon until about five years ago. In fact  we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles. So you can imagine what a seamless transition that was. Actually  we lived in a place called Snitterfield  just outside Stratford  which is where Shakespeare's father was born. Are you struck by a new thought  I was. You don't think of Shakespeare having a father  do you  Do you  Because you don't think of Shakespeare being a child  do you  Shakespeare being seven  I never thought of it. I mean  he was seven at some point. He was in somebody's English class  wasn't he  How annoying would that be   Must try harder.  Being sent to bed by his dad  you know  to Shakespeare   Go to bed  now  And put the pencil down.   And stop speaking like that.   It's confusing everybody.  Anyway  we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles  and I just want to say a word about the transition. My son didn't want to come. I've got two kids  he's    now  my daughter's   . He didn't want to come to Los Angeles. He loved it  but he had a girlfriend in England. This was the love of his life  Sarah. He'd known her for a month. Mind you  they'd had their fourth anniversary  because it's a long time when you're   . He was really upset on the plane  he said   I'll never find another girl like Sarah.  And we were rather pleased about that  frankly    Because she was the main reason we were leaving the country. But something strikes you when you move to America and travel around the world  Every education system on Earth has the same hierarchy of subjects. Every one. Doesn't matter where you go. You'd think it would be otherwise  but it isn't. At the top are mathematics and languages  then the humanities  and at the bottom are the arts. Everywhere on Earth. And in pretty much every system too  there's a hierarchy within the arts. Art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance. There isn't an education system on the planet that teaches dance everyday to children the way we teach them mathematics. Why  Why not  I think this is rather important. I think math is very important  but so is dance. Children dance all the time if they're allowed to  we all do. We all have bodies  don't we  Did I miss a meeting  Truthfully  what happens is  as children grow up  we start to educate them progressively from the waist up. And then we focus on their heads. And slightly to one side. If you were to visit education  as an alien  and say  What's it for  public education   I think you'd have to conclude  if you look at the output  who really succeeds by this  who does everything that they should  who gets all the brownie points  who are the winners    I think you'd have to conclude the whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors. Isn't it  They're the people who come out the top. And I used to be one  so there. And I like university professors  but you know  we shouldn't hold them up as the high water mark of all human achievement. They're just a form of life  another form of life. But they're rather curious  and I say this out of affection for them. There's something curious about professors in my experience    not all of them  but typically  they live in their heads. They live up there  and slightly to one side. They're disembodied  you know  in a kind of literal way. They look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads. Don't they  It's a way of getting their head to meetings. If you want real evidence of out of body experiences  get yourself along to a residential conference of senior academics  and pop into the discotheque on the final night. And there  you will see it. Grown men and women writhing uncontrollably  off the beat. Waiting until it ends so they can go home and write a paper about it. Our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability. And there's a reason. Around the world  there were no public systems of education  really  before the   th century. They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism. So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas. Number one  that the most useful subjects for work are at the top. So you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kid  things you liked  on the grounds that you would never get a job doing that. Is that right  Don't do music  you're not going to be a musician  don't do art  you won't be an artist. Benign advice    now  profoundly mistaken. The whole world is engulfed in a revolution. And the second is academic ability  which has really come to dominate our view of intelligence  because the universities designed the system in their image. If you think of it  the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance. And the consequence is that many highly talented  brilliant  creative people think they're not  because the thing they were good at at school wasn't valued  or was actually stigmatized. And I think we can't afford to go on that way. In the next    years  according to UNESCO  more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of history. More people  and it's the combination of all the things we've talked about    technology and its transformation effect on work  and demography and the huge explosion in population. Suddenly  degrees aren't worth anything. Isn't that true  When I was a student  if you had a degree  you had a job. If you didn't have a job  it's because you didn't want one. And I didn't want one  frankly.  Laughter  But now kids with degrees are often heading home to carry on playing video games  because you need an MA where the previous job required a BA  and now you need a PhD for the other. It's a process of academic inflation. And it indicates the whole structure of education is shifting beneath our feet. We need to radically rethink our view of intelligence. We know three things about intelligence. One  it's diverse. We think about the world in all the ways that we experience it. We think visually  we think in sound  we think kinesthetically. We think in abstract terms  we think in movement. Secondly  intelligence is dynamic. If you look at the interactions of a human brain  as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations  intelligence is wonderfully interactive. The brain isn't divided into compartments. In fact  creativity    which I define as the process of having original ideas that have value    more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things. By the way  there's a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain called the corpus callosum. It's thicker in women. Following off from Helen yesterday  this is probably why women are better at multi tasking. Because you are  aren't you  There's a raft of research  but I know it from my personal life. If my wife is cooking a meal at home    which is not often  thankfully. No  she's good at some things  but if she's cooking  she's dealing with people on the phone  she's talking to the kids  she's painting the ceiling  she's doing open heart surgery over here. If I'm cooking  the door is shut  the kids are out  the phone's on the hook  if she comes in I get annoyed. I say   Terry  please  I'm trying to fry an egg in here.   Give me a break.  Actually  do you know that old philosophical thing  if a tree falls in a forest and nobody hears it  did it happen  Remember that old chestnut  I saw a great t shirt recently  which said   If a man speaks his mind in a forest  and no woman hears him  is he still wrong   And the third thing about intelligence is  it's distinct. I'm doing a new book at the moment called  Epiphany   which is based on a series of interviews with people about how they discovered their talent. I'm fascinated by how people got to be there. It's really prompted by a conversation I had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have never heard of  Gillian Lynne. Have you heard of her  Some have. She's a choreographer  and everybody knows her work. She did  Cats  and  Phantom of the Opera.  She's wonderful. I used to be on the board of The Royal Ballet  as you can see. Anyway  Gillian and I had lunch one day and I said   How did you get to be a dancer   It was interesting. When she was at school  she was really hopeless. And the school  in the '  s  wrote to her parents and said   We think Gillian has a learning disorder.  She couldn't concentrate  she was fidgeting. I think now they'd say she had ADHD. Wouldn't you  But this was the     s  and ADHD hadn't been invented at this point. It wasn't an available condition. People weren't aware they could have that. Anyway  she went to see this specialist. So  this oak paneled room  and she was there with her mother  and she was led and sat on this chair at the end  and she sat on her hands for    minutes while this man talked to her mother about the problems Gillian was having at school. Because she was disturbing people  her homework was always late  and so on  little kid of eight. In the end  the doctor went and sat next to Gillian  and said   I've listened to all these things your mother's told me  I need to speak to her privately. Wait here. We'll be back  we won't be very long   and they went and left her. But as they went out of the room  he turned on the radio that was sitting on his desk. And when they got out  he said to her mother   Just stand and watch her.  And the minute they left the room  she was on her feet  moving to the music. And they watched for a few minutes and he turned to her mother and said   Mrs. Lynne  Gillian isn't sick  she's a dancer. Take her to a dance school.  I said   What happened   She said   She did. I can't tell you how wonderful it was. We walked in this room and it was full of people like me. People who couldn't sit still. People who had to move to think.  Who had to move to think. They did ballet  they did tap  jazz  they did modern  they did contemporary. She was eventually auditioned for the Royal Ballet School  she became a soloist  she had a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet. She eventually graduated from the Royal Ballet School  founded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company  met Andrew Lloyd Webber. She's been responsible for some of the most successful musical theater productions in history  she's given pleasure to millions  and she's a multi millionaire. Somebody else might have put her on medication and told her to calm down. What I think it comes to is this  Al Gore spoke the other night about ecology and the revolution that was triggered by Rachel Carson. I believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception of human ecology  one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity. Our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip mine the earth  for a particular commodity. And for the future  it won't serve us. We have to rethink the fundamental principles on which we're educating our children. There was a wonderful quote by Jonas Salk  who said   If all the insects were to disappear from the Earth  within    years all life on Earth would end. If all human beings disappeared from the Earth  within    years all forms of life would flourish.  And he's right. What TED celebrates is the gift of the human imagination. We have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely and that we avert some of the scenarios that we've talked about. And the only way we'll do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are. And our task is to educate their whole being  so they can face this future. By the way    we may not see this future  but they will. And our job is to help them make something of it. Thank you very much. About    years ago  I took on the task to teach global development to Swedish undergraduate students. That was after having spent about    years together with African institutions studying hunger in Africa  so I was sort of expected to know a little about the world. And I started in our medical university  Karolinska Institute  an undergraduate course called Global Health. But when you get that opportunity  you get a little nervous. I thought  these students coming to us actually have the highest grade you can get in Swedish college systems    so I thought  maybe they know everything I'm going to teach them about. So I did a pre test when they came. And one of the questions from which I learned a lot was this one   Which country has the highest child mortality of these five pairs   I put them together  so that in each pair of country  one has twice the child mortality of the other. And this means that it's much bigger a difference than the uncertainty of the data. I won't put you at a test here  but it's Turkey  which is highest there  Poland  Russia  Pakistan and South Africa. And these were the results of the Swedish students. I did it so I got the confidence interval  which is pretty narrow  and I got happy  of course  a  .  right answer out of five possible. That means that there was a place for a professor of international health and for my course. But one late night  when I was compiling the report  I really realized my discovery. I have shown that Swedish top students know statistically significantly less about the world than the chimpanzees. Because the chimpanzee would score half right if I gave them two bananas with Sri Lanka and Turkey. They would be right half of the cases. But the students are not there. The problem for me was not ignorance  it was preconceived ideas. I did also an unethical study of the professors of the Karolinska Institute  that hands out the Nobel Prize in Medicine  and they are on par with the chimpanzee there. This is where I realized that there was really a need to communicate  because the data of what's happening in the world and the child health of every country is very well aware. We did this software which displays it like this  every bubble here is a country. This country over here is China. This is India. The size of the bubble is the population  and on this axis here  I put fertility rate. Because my students  what they said when they looked upon the world  and I asked them   What do you really think about the world   Well  I first discovered that the textbook was Tintin  mainly. And they said   The world is still 'we' and 'them.' And 'we' is Western world and 'them' is Third World.   And what do you mean with Western world   I said.  Well  that's long life and small family  and Third World is short life and large family.  So this is what I could display here. I put fertility rate here  number of children per woman  one  two  three  four  up to about eight children per woman. We have very good data since              about    on the size of families in all countries. The error margin is narrow. Here  I put life expectancy at birth  from    years in some countries up to about    years. And       there was really a group of countries here that was industrialized countries  and they had small families and long lives. And these were the developing countries  they had large families and they had relatively short lives. Now  what has happened since       We want to see the change. Are the students right  Is it still two types of countries  Or have these developing countries got smaller families and they live here  Or have they got longer lives and live up there  Let's see. We stopped the world then. This is all U.N. statistics that have been available. Here we go. Can you see there  It's China there  moving against better health there  improving there. All the green Latin American countries are moving towards smaller families. Your yellow ones here are the Arabic countries  and they get longer life  but not larger families. The Africans are the green here. They still remain here. This is India  Indonesia is moving on pretty fast. In the '  s here  you have Bangladesh still among the African countries. But now  Bangladesh    it's a miracle that happens in the '  s  the imams start to promote family planning. They move up into that corner. And in the '  s  we have the terrible HIV epidemic that takes down the life expectancy of the African countries and all the rest of them move up into the corner  where we have long lives and small family  and we have a completely new world. Let me make a comparison directly between the United States of America and Vietnam.     . America had small families and long life  Vietnam had large families and short lives. And this is what happens  the data during the war indicate that even with all the death  there was an improvement of life expectancy. By the end of the year  the family planning started in Vietnam  they went for smaller families. And the United States up there is getting for longer life  keeping family size. And in the '  s now  they give up Communist planning and they go for market economy  and it moves faster even than social life. And today  we have in Vietnam the same life expectancy and the same family size here in Vietnam        as in United States        by the end of the war. If we don't look in the data  I think we all underestimate the tremendous change in Asia  which was in social change before we saw the economical change. Let's move over to another way here in which we could display the distribution in the world of the income. This is the world distribution of income of people. One dollar     dollars or     dollars per day. There's no gap between rich and poor any longer. This is a myth. There's a little hump here. But there are people all the way. And if we look where the income ends up  this is     percent the world's annual income. And the richest    percent  they take out of that about    percent. And the poorest    percent  they take about two percent. And this shows that the concept of developing countries is extremely doubtful. We think about aid  like these people here giving aid to these people here. But in the middle  we have most of the world population  and they have now    percent of the income. We heard it in other forms. And who are these  Where are the different countries  I can show you Africa. This is Africa.     the world population  most in poverty. This is OECD. The rich country. The country club of the U.N. And they are over here on this side. Quite an overlap between Africa and OECD. And this is Latin America. It has everything on this Earth  from the poorest to the richest in Latin America. And on top of that  we can put East Europe  we can put East Asia  and we put South Asia. And how did it look like if we go back in time  to about       Then there was more of a hump. And we have most who lived in absolute poverty were Asians. The problem in the world was the poverty in Asia. And if I now let the world move forward  you will see that while population increases  there are hundreds of millions in Asia getting out of poverty and some others getting into poverty  and this is the pattern we have today. And the best projection from the World Bank is that this will happen  and we will not have a divided world. We'll have most people in the middle. Of course it's a logarithmic scale here  but our concept of economy is growth with percent. We look upon it as a possibility of percentile increase. If I change this  and take GDP per capita instead of family income  and I turn these individual data into regional data of gross domestic product  and I take the regions down here  the size of the bubble is still the population. And you have the OECD there  and you have sub Saharan Africa there  and we take off the Arab states there  coming both from Africa and from Asia  and we put them separately  and we can expand this axis  and I can give it a new dimension here  by adding the social values there  child survival. Now I have money on that axis  and I have the possibility of children to survive there. In some countries    .   of children survive to five years of age  others  only   . And here  it seems  there is a gap between OECD  Latin America  East Europe  East Asia  Arab states  South Asia and sub Saharan Africa. The linearity is very strong between child survival and money. But let me split sub Saharan Africa. Health is there and better health is up there. I can go here and I can split sub Saharan Africa into its countries. And when it burst  the size of its country bubble is the size of the population. Sierra Leone down there. Mauritius is up there. Mauritius was the first country to get away with trade barriers  and they could sell their sugar    they could sell their textiles    on equal terms as the people in Europe and North America. There's a huge difference between Africa. And Ghana is here in the middle. In Sierra Leone  humanitarian aid. Here in Uganda  development aid. Here  time to invest  there  you can go for a holiday. It's a tremendous variation within Africa which we rarely often make    that it's equal everything. I can split South Asia here. India's the big bubble in the middle. But a huge difference between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. I can split Arab states. How are they  Same climate  same culture  same religion    huge difference. Even between neighbors. Yemen  civil war. United Arab Emirates  money  which was quite equally and well used. Not as the myth is. And that includes all the children of the foreign workers who are in the country. Data is often better than you think. Many people say data is bad. There is an uncertainty margin  but we can see the difference here  Cambodia  Singapore. The differences are much bigger than the weakness of the data. East Europe  Soviet economy for a long time  but they come out after    years very  very differently. And there is Latin America. Today  we don't have to go to Cuba to find a healthy country in Latin America. Chile will have a lower child mortality than Cuba within some few years from now. Here  we have high income countries in the OECD. And we get the whole pattern here of the world  which is more or less like this. And if we look at it  how the world looks  in       it starts to move. This is Mao Tse tung. He brought health to China. And then he died. And then Deng Xiaoping came and brought money to China  and brought them into the mainstream again. And we have seen how countries move in different directions like this  so it's sort of difficult to get an example country which shows the pattern of the world. But I would like to bring you back to about here  at     . I would like to compare South Korea  which is this one  with Brazil  which is this one. The label went away for me here. And I would like to compare Uganda  which is there. And I can run it forward  like this. And you can see how South Korea is making a very  very fast advancement  whereas Brazil is much slower. And if we move back again  here  and we put on trails on them  like this  you can see again that the speed of development is very  very different  and the countries are moving more or less in the same rate as money and health  but it seems you can move much faster if you are healthy first than if you are wealthy first. And to show that  you can put on the way of United Arab Emirates. They came from here  a mineral country. They cached all the oil  they got all the money  but health cannot be bought at the supermarket. You have to invest in health. You have to get kids into schooling. You have to train health staff. You have to educate the population. And Sheikh Zayed did that in a fairly good way. In spite of falling oil prices  he brought this country up here. So we've got a much more mainstream appearance of the world  where all countries tend to use their money better than they used in the past. Now  this is  more or less  if you look at the average data of the countries    they are like this. Now that's dangerous  to use average data  because there is such a lot of difference within countries. So if I go and look here  we can see that Uganda today is where South Korea was in     . If I split Uganda  there's quite a difference within Uganda. These are the quintiles of Uganda. The richest    percent of Ugandans are there. The poorest are down there. If I split South Africa  it's like this. And if I go down and look at Niger  where there was such a terrible famine  lastly  it's like this. The    percent poorest of Niger is out here  and the    percent richest of South Africa is there  and yet we tend to discuss on what solutions there should be in Africa. Everything in this world exists in Africa. And you can't discuss universal access to HIV  medicine  for that quintile up here with the same strategy as down here. The improvement of the world must be highly contextualized  and it's not relevant to have it on regional level. We must be much more detailed. We find that students get very excited when they can use this. And even more  policy makers and the corporate sectors would like to see how the world is changing. Now  why doesn't this take place  Why are we not using the data we have  We have data in the United Nations  in the national statistical agencies and in universities and other non governmental organizations. Because the data is hidden down in the databases. And the public is there  and the Internet is there  but we have still not used it effectively. All that information we saw changing in the world does not include publicly funded statistics. There are some web pages like this  you know  but they take some nourishment down from the databases  but people put prices on them  stupid passwords and boring statistics. And this won't work. So what is needed  We have the databases. It's not the new database you need. We have wonderful design tools  and more and more are added up here. So we started a nonprofit venture which  linking data to design  we called Gapminder  from the London Underground  where they warn you   mind the gap.  So we thought Gapminder was appropriate. And we started to write software which could link the data like this. And it wasn't that difficult. It took some person years  and we have produced animations. You can take a data set and put it there. We are liberating U.N. data  some few U.N. organization. Some countries accept that their databases can go out on the world  but what we really need is  of course  a search function. A search function where we can copy the data up to a searchable format and get it out in the world. And what do we hear when we go around  I've done anthropology on the main statistical units. Everyone says   It's impossible. This can't be done. Our information is so peculiar in detail  so that cannot be searched as others can be searched. We cannot give the data free to the students  free to the entrepreneurs of the world.  But this is what we would like to see  isn't it  The publicly funded data is down here. And we would like flowers to grow out on the Net. And one of the crucial points is to make them searchable  and then people can use the different design tool to animate it there. And I have pretty good news for you. I have good news that the present  new Head of U.N. Statistics  he doesn't say it's impossible. He only says   We can't do it.  And that's a quite clever guy  huh  So we can see a lot happening in data in the coming years. We will be able to look at income distributions in completely new ways. This is the income distribution of China      . This is the income distribution of the United States      . Almost no overlap. And what has happened  What has happened is this  that China is growing  it's not so equal any longer  and it's appearing here  overlooking the United States. Almost like a ghost  isn't it  It's pretty scary. But I think it's very important to have all this information. We need really to see it. And instead of looking at this  I would like to end up by showing the Internet users per      . In this software  we access about     variables from all the countries quite easily. It takes some time to change for this  but on the axises  you can quite easily get any variable you would like to have. And the thing would be to get up the databases free  to get them searchable  and with a second click  to get them into the graphic formats  where you can instantly understand them. Now  statisticians don't like it  because they say that this will not show the reality  we have to have statistical  analytical methods. But this is hypothesis generating. I end now with the world. There  the Internet is coming. The number of Internet users are going up like this. This is the GDP per capita. And it's a new technology coming in  but then amazingly  how well it fits to the economy of the countries. That's why the      computer will be so important. But it's a nice tendency. It's as if the world is flattening off  isn't it  These countries are lifting more than the economy and will be very interesting to follow this over the year  as I would like you to be able to do with all the publicly funded data. Thank you very much. Thank you. I have to tell you I'm both challenged and excited. My excitement is  I get a chance to give something back. My challenge is  the shortest seminar I usually do is    hours. I'm not exaggerating. I do weekends    I do more  obviously  I also coach people    but I'm into immersion  because how did you learn language  Not just by learning principles  you got in it and you did it so often that it became real. The bottom line of why I'm here  besides being a crazy mofo  is that    I'm not here to motivate you  you don't need that  obviously. Often that's what people think I do  and it's the furthest thing from it. What happens  though  is people say to me   I don't need any motivation.  But that's not what I do. I'm the  why  guy. I want to know why you do what you do. What is your motive for action  What is it that drives you in your life today  Not    years ago. Are you running the same pattern  Because I believe that the invisible force of internal drive  activated  is the most important thing. I'm here because I believe emotion is the force of life. All of us here have great minds. Most of us here have great minds  right  We all know how to think. With our minds we can rationalize anything. We can make anything happen. I agree with what was described a few days ago  that people work in their self interest. But we know that that's bullshit at times. You don't work in your self interest all the time  because when emotion comes into it  the wiring changes in the way it functions. So it's wonderful to think intellectually about how the life of the world is  especially those who are very smart can play this game in our head. But I really want to know what's driving you. What I would like to invite you to do by the end of this talk is explore where you are today  for two reasons. One  so that you can contribute more. And two  that hopefully we can not just understand other people more  but appreciate them more  and create the kinds of connections that can stop some of the challenges that we face today. They're only going to get magnified by the very technology that connects us  because it's making us intersect. That intersection doesn't always create a view of  everybody now understands everybody  and everybody appreciates everybody.  I've had an obsession basically for    years   What makes the difference in the quality of people's lives  What in their performance   I got hired to produce the result now. I've done it for    years. I get the phone call when the athlete is burning down on national television  and they were ahead by five strokes and now they can't get back on the course. I've got to do something right now or nothing matters. I get the phone call when the child is going to commit suicide  I've got to do something. In    years  I'm very grateful to tell you I've never lost one. It doesn't mean I won't some day  but I haven't yet. The reason is an understanding of these human needs. When I get those calls about performance  that's one thing. How do you make a change  I'm also looking to see what is shaping the person's ability to contribute  to do something beyond themselves. Maybe the real question is  I look at life and say there's two master lessons. One is  there's the science of achievement  which almost everyone here has mastered amazingly.  How do you take the invisible and make it visible   How do you make your dreams happen  Your business  your contribution to society  money    whatever  your body  your family. The other lesson that is rarely mastered is the art of fulfillment. Because science is easy  right  We know the rules  you write the code and you get the results. Once you know the game  you just up the ante  don't you  But when it comes to fulfillment    that's an art. The reason is  it's about appreciation and contribution. You can only feel so much by yourself. I've had an interesting laboratory to try to answer the real question how somebody's life changes if you look at them like those people that you've given everything to  Like all the resources they say they need. You gave not a     dollar computer  but the best computer. You gave them love  joy  were there to comfort them. Those people very often    you know some of them    end up the rest of their life with all this love  education  money and background going in and out of rehab. Some people have been through ultimate pain  psychologically  sexually  spiritually  emotionally abused    and not always  but often  they become some of the people that contribute the most to society. The question we've got to ask ourselves really is  what is it  What is it that shapes us  We live in a therapy culture. Most of us don't do that  but the culture's a therapy culture  the mindset that we are our past. And you wouldn't be in this room if you bought that  but most of society thinks biography is destiny. The past equals the future. Of course it does if you live there. But what we know and what we have to remind ourselves    because you can know something intellectually and then not use it  not apply it. We've got to remind ourselves that decision is the ultimate power. When you ask people  have you failed to achieve something significant in your life  Say   Aye.  Audience  Aye. TR  Thanks for the interaction on a high level there. But if you ask people  why didn't you achieve something  Somebody who's working for you  or a partner  or even yourself. When you fail to achieve  what's the reason people say  What do they tell you  Didn't have the knowledge  didn't have the money  didn't have the time  didn't have the technology. I didn't have the right manager. Al Gore  Supreme Court. TR  The Supreme Court. TR  And    What do all those  including the Supreme Court  have in common  They are a claim to you missing resources  and they may be accurate. You may not have the money  or the Supreme Court  but that is not the defining factor. And you correct me if I'm wrong. The defining factor is never resources  it's resourcefulness. And what I mean specifically  rather than just some phrase  is if you have emotion  human emotion  something that I experienced from you the day before yesterday at a level that is as profound as I've ever experienced and I believe with that emotion you would have beat his ass and won. Audience  Yeah  How easy for me to tell him what he should do. Idiot  Robbins. But I know when we watched the debate at that time  there were emotions that blocked people's ability to get this man's intellect and capacity. And the way that it came across to some people on that day    because I know people that wanted to vote in your direction and didn't  and I was upset. But there was emotion there. Do you know what I'm talking about  Say   Aye.  Audience  Aye. TR  So  emotion is it. And if we get the right emotion  we can get ourselves to do anything. If you're creative  playful  fun enough  can you get through to anybody  yes or no  If you don't have the money  but you're creative and determined  you find the way. This is the ultimate resource. But this is not the story that people tell us. They tell us a bunch of different stories. They tell us we don't have the resources  but ultimately  if you take a look here  they say  what are all the reasons they haven't accomplished that  He's broken my pattern  that son of a bitch. But I appreciated the energy  I'll tell you that. What determines your resources  We've said decisions shape destiny  which is my focus here. If decisions shape destiny  what determines it is three decisions. What will you focus on  You have to decide what you're going to focus on. Consciously or unconsciously. the minute you decide to focus  you must give it a meaning  and that meaning produces emotion. Is this the end or the beginning  Is God punishing me or rewarding me  or is this the roll of the dice  An emotion creates what we're going to do  or the action. So  think about your own life  the decisions that have shaped your destiny. And that sounds really heavy  but in the last five or    years  have there been some decisions that if you'd made a different decision  your life would be completely different  How many can think about it  Better or worse. Say   Aye.  Audience  Aye. So the bottom line is  maybe it was where to go to work  and you met the love of your life there  a career decision. I know the Google geniuses I saw here    I mean  I understand that their decision was to sell their technology. What if they made that decision versus to build their own culture  How would the world or their lives be different  their impact  The history of our world is these decisions. When a woman stands up and says   No  I won't go to the back of the bus.  She didn't just affect her life. That decision shaped our culture. Or someone standing in front of a tank. Or being in a position like Lance Armstrong   You've got testicular cancer.  That's pretty tough for any male  especially if you ride a bike. You've got it in your brain  you've got it in your lungs. But what was his decision of what to focus on  Different than most people. What did it mean  It wasn't the end  it was the beginning. He goes off and wins seven championships he never once won before the cancer  because he got emotional fitness  psychological strength. That's the difference in human beings that I've seen of the three million I've been around. In my lab  I've had three million people from    countries over the last    years. And after a while  patterns become obvious. You see that South America and Africa may be connected in a certain way  right  Others say   Oh  that sounds ridiculous.  It's simple. So  what shaped Lance  What shapes you  Two invisible forces. Very quickly. One  state. We all have had times  you did something  and after  you thought to yourself   I can't believe I said or did that  that was so stupid.  Who's been there  Say   Aye.  Audience  Aye. Or after you did something  you go   That was me   It wasn't your ability  it was your state. Your model of the world is what shapes you long term. Your model of the world is the filter. That's what's shaping us. It makes people make decisions. To influence somebody  we need to know what already influences them. It's made up of three parts. First  what's your target  What are you after  It's not your desires. You can get your desires or goals. Who has ever got a goal or desire and thought  is this all there is  Say   Aye.  Audience  Aye. It's needs we have. I believe there are six human needs. Second  once you know what the target that's driving you is and you uncover it for the truth    you don't form it    then you find out what's your map  what's the belief systems that tell you how to get those needs. Some people think the way to get them is to destroy the world  some people  to build  create something  love someone. There's the fuel you pick. So very quickly  six needs. Let me tell you what they are. First one  certainty. These are not goals or desires  these are universal. Everyone needs certainty they can avoid pain and at least be comfortable. Now  how do you get it  Control everybody  Develop a skill  Give up  Smoke a cigarette  And if you got totally certain  ironically  even though we need that    you're not certain about your health  or your children  or money. If you're not sure the ceiling will hold up  you won't listen to any speaker. While we go for certainty differently  if we get total certainty  we get what  What do you feel if you're certain  You know what will happen  when and how it will happen  what would you feel  Bored out of your minds. So  God  in Her infinite wisdom  gave us a second human need  which is uncertainty. We need variety. We need surprise. How many of you here love surprises  Say   Aye.  Audience  Aye. TR  Bullshit. You like the surprises you want. The ones you don't want  you call problems  but you need them. So  variety is important. Have you ever rented a video or a film that you've already seen  Who's done this  Get a fucking life. Why are you doing it  You're certain it's good because you read or saw it before  but you're hoping it's been long enough you've forgotten  and there's variety. Third human need  critical  significance. We all need to feel important  special  unique. You can get it by making more money or being more spiritual. You can do it by getting yourself in a situation where you put more tattoos and earrings in places humans don't want to know. Whatever it takes. The fastest way to do this  if you have no background  no culture  no belief and resources or resourcefulness  is violence. If I put a gun to your head and I live in the 'hood  instantly I'm significant. Zero to   . How high    . How certain am I that you're going to respond to me    . How much uncertainty  Who knows what's going to happen next  Kind of exciting. Like climbing up into a cave and doing that stuff all the way down there. Total variety and uncertainty. And it's significant  isn't it  So you want to risk your life for it. So that's why violence has always been around and will be around unless we have a consciousness change as a species. You can get significance a million ways  but to be significant  you've got to be unique and different. Here's what we really need  connection and love  fourth need. We all want it  most settle for connection  love's too scary. Who here has been hurt in an intimate relationship  If you don't raise your hand  you've had other shit  too. And you're going to get hurt again. Aren't you glad you came to this positive visit  Here's what's true  we need it. We can do it through intimacy  friendship  prayer  through walking in nature. If nothing else works for you  don't get a cat  get a dog  because if you leave for two minutes  it's like you've been gone six months  when you come back   minutes later. These first four needs  every human finds a way to meet. Even if you lie to yourself  you need to have split personalities. I call the first four needs the needs of the personality. The last two are the needs of the spirit. And this is where fulfillment comes. You won't get it from the first four. You'll figure a way  smoke  drink  do whatever  meet the first four. But number five  you must grow. We all know the answer. If you don't grow  you're what  If a relationship or business is not growing  if you're not growing  doesn't matter how much money or friends you have  how many love you  you feel like hell. And I believe the reason we grow is so we have something to give of value. Because the sixth need is to contribute beyond ourselves. Because we all know  corny as that sounds  the secret to living is giving. We all know life is not about me  it's about we. This culture knows that  this room knows that. It's exciting. When you see Nicholas talking about his      computer  the most exciting thing is  here's a genius  but he's got a calling now. You can feel the difference in him  and it's beautiful. And that calling can touch other people. My life was touched because when I was    years old  Thanksgiving  no money  no food  we were not going to starve  but my father was totally messed up  my mom was letting him know how bad he messed up  and somebody came to the door and delivered food. My father made three decisions  I know what they were  briefly. His focus was  This is charity. What does it mean  I'm worthless. What do I have to do  Leave my family   which he did. It was one of the most painful experiences of life. My three decisions gave me a different path. I set focus on  There's food.  What a concept  But this is what changed my life  shaped me as a human being. Somebody's gift  I don't even know who it is. My father always said   No one gives a shit.  And now somebody I don't know  they're not asking for anything  just giving us food  looking out for us. It made me believe this  that strangers care. And that made me decide  if strangers care about me and my family  I care about them. I'm going to do something to make a difference. So when I was     I went out on Thanksgiving  it was my target for years to have enough money to feed two families. The most fun and moving thing I ever did in my life. Next year  I did four  then eight. I didn't tell anybody what I was doing  I wasn't doing it for brownie points. But after eight  I thought I could use some help. So I went out  got my friends involved  then I grew companies  got     and I built the foundation.    years later  I'm proud to tell you last year we fed   million people in    countries through our foundation. All during the holidays  Thanksgiving  Christmas  in different countries around the world. Thank you. I don't tell you that to brag  but because I'm proud of human beings because they get excited to contribute once they've had the chance to experience it  not talk about it. So  finally    I'm about out of time. The target that shapes you    Here's what's different about people. We have the same needs. But are you a certainty freak  is that what you value most  or uncertainty  This man couldn't be a certainty freak if he climbed through those caves. Are you driven by significance or love  We all need all six  but what your lead system is tilts you in a different direction. And as you move in a direction  you have a destination or destiny. The second piece is the map. The operating system tells you how to get there  and some people's map is   I'm going to save lives even if I die for other people   and they're a fireman  and somebody else says   I'm going to kill people to do it.  They're trying to meet the same needs of significance. They want to honor God or honor their family. But they have a different map. And there are seven different beliefs  I can't go through them  because I'm done. The last piece is emotion. One of the parts of the map is like time. Some people's idea of a long time is     years. Somebody else's is three seconds  which is what I have. And the last one I've already mentioned that fell to you. If you've got a target and a map    I can't use Google because I love Macs  and they haven't made it good for Macs yet. So if you use MapQuest    how many have made this fatal mistake of using it  You use this thing and you don't get there. Imagine if your beliefs guarantee you can never get to where you want to go. The last thing is emotion. Here's what I'll tell you about emotion. There are       emotions that we have words for in the English language  which is just a linguistic representation that changes by language. But if your dominant emotions    If I have        people or       and I have them write down all the emotions that they experience in an average week  and I give them as long as they need  and on one side they write empowering emotions  the other's disempowering  guess how many emotions they experience  Less than   . And half of those make them feel like shit. They have six good feelings. Happy  happy  excited  oh shit  frustrated  frustrated  overwhelmed  depressed. How many of you know somebody who  no matter what happens  finds a way to get pissed off  Or no matter what happens  they find a way to be happy or excited. How many of you know somebody like this  When      happened  I'll finish with this  I was in Hawaii. I was with       people from    countries  we were translating four languages simultaneously for a program I was conducting  for a week. The night before was called Emotional Mastery. I got up  had no plan for this  and I said    we had fireworks  I do crazy shit  fun stuff  and at the end  I stopped. I had this plan  but I never know what I'm going to say. And all of a sudden  I said   When do people really start to live  When they face death.  And I went through this whole thing about  if you weren't going to get off this island  if nine days from now  you were going to die  who would you call  what would you say  what would you do  That night is when      happened. One woman had come to the seminar  and when she came there  her previous boyfriend had been kidnapped and murdered. Her new boyfriend wanted to marry her  and she said no. He said   If you go to that Hawaii thing  it's over with us.  She said   It's over.  When I finished that night  she called him and left a message at the top of the World Trade Center where he worked  saying   I love you  I want you to know I want to marry you. It was stupid of me.  She was asleep  because it was   a.m. for us  when he called her back  and said   Honey  I can't tell you what this means. I don't know how to tell you this  but you gave me the greatest gift  because I'm going to die.  And she played the recording for us in the room. She was on Larry King later. And he said   You're probably wondering how on Earth this could happen to you twice. All I can say is this must be God's message to you. From now on  every day  give your all  love your all. Don't let anything ever stop you.  She finishes  and a man stands up  and he says   I'm from Pakistan  I'm a Muslim. I'd love to hold your hand and say I'm sorry  but frankly  this is retribution.  I can't tell you the rest  because I'm out of time. Are you sure     seconds     seconds  I want to be respectful. All I can tell you is  I brought this man on stage with a man from New York who worked in the World Trade Center  because I had about     New Yorkers there. More than    lost their entire companies  friends  marking off their Palm Pilots. One financial trader  woman made of steel  bawling       friends crossing off that all died. And I said   What are we going to focus on  What does this mean and what are we going to do   And I got the group to focus on  if you didn't lose somebody today  your focus is going to be how to serve somebody else. Then one woman stood up and was so angry  screaming and yelling. I found out she wasn't from New York  she's not an American  doesn't know anybody here. I asked   Do you always get angry   She said   Yes.  Guilty people got guilty  sad people got sad. I took these two men and I did an indirect negotiation. Jewish man with family in the occupied territory  someone in New York who would have died if he was at work that day  and this man who wanted to be a terrorist  and I made it very clear. This integration is on a film  which I'd be happy to send you  instead of my verbalization  but the two of them not only came together and changed their beliefs and models of the world  but worked together to bring  for almost four years now  through various mosques and synagogues  the idea of how to create peace. And he wrote a book  called  My Jihad  My Way of Peace.  So  transformation can happen. My invitation to you is  explore your web  the web in here    the needs  the beliefs  the emotions that are controlling you  for two reasons  so there's more of you to give  and achieve  too  but I mean give  because that's what's going to fill you up. And secondly  so you can appreciate    not just understand  that's intellectual  that's the mind  but appreciate what's driving other people. It's the only way our world's going to change. God bless you  thank you. I hope this was of service. I'm going to take you on a journey very quickly. To explain the wish  I'm going to have to take you somewhere where many people haven't been  and that's around the world. When I was about    years old  Kate Stohr and myself started an organization to get architects and designers involved in humanitarian work  not only about responding to natural disasters  but involved in systemic issues. We believe that where the resources and expertise are scarce  innovative  sustainable design can really make a difference in people's lives. So I started my life as an architect  or training as an architect  and I was always interested in socially responsible design  and how you can really make an impact. But when I went to architecture school  it seemed that I was a black sheep in the family. Many architects seemed to think that when you design  you design a jewel  and it's a jewel that you try and crave for  whereas I felt that when you design  you either improve or you create a detriment to the community in which you're designing. So you're not just doing a building for the residents or for the people who are going to use it  but for the community as a whole. And in       we started by responding to the issue of the housing crisis for returning refugees in Kosovo. And I didn't know what I was doing    like I said  mid   s    and I'm the Internet generation  so we started a website. We put a call out there  and to my surprise  in a couple of months  we had hundreds of entries from around the world. That led to a number of prototypes being built and really experimenting with some ideas. Two years later we started doing a project on developing mobile health clinics in sub Saharan Africa  responding to the HIV AIDS pandemic. That led to     entries from    countries. We also have designers from around the world that participate. And we had an exhibit of work that followed that.      was the tipping point for us. We started responding to natural disasters and getting involved in Iran  in Bam  also following up on our work in Africa. Working within the United States    most people look at poverty and they see the face of a foreigner. But I live in Bozeman  Montana    go up to the north plains on the reservations  or go down to Alabama or Mississippi  pre Katrina  and I could have shown you places that have far worse conditions than many developing countries that I've been to. So we got involved in and worked in inner cities and elsewhere  and also  I will go into some more projects.       Mother Nature kicked our ass. I think we can pretty much assume that      was a horrific year when it comes to natural disasters. And because of the Internet  and because of connections to blogs and so forth  within literally hours of the tsunami  we were already raising funds  getting involved  working with people on the ground. We run from a couple of laptops  and in the first couple of days  I had       emails from people needing help. So we began to get involved in projects there  and I'll talk about some others. And then of course  this year we've been responding to Katrina  as well as following up on our reconstruction work. So this is a brief overview. In       I really couldn't manage the number of people who wanted to help  or the number of requests that I was getting. It was all coming into my laptop and cell phone. So we decided to embrace an open source model of business    so that anyone  anywhere in the world  could start a local chapter  and they can get involved in local problems. Because I believe there is no such thing as Utopia. All problems are local. All solutions are local. So that means  you know  somebody who's based in Mississippi knows more about Mississippi than I do. So what happened is  we used Meetup and all these other Internet tools  and we ended up having    chapters starting up  thousands of architects in     countries. So the bullet point    sorry  I never do a suit  so I knew that I was going to take this off. OK  because I'm going to do it very quick. This isn't just about nonprofit. What it showed me is that there's a grassroots movement going on  of socially responsible designers who really believe that this world has got a lot smaller  and that we have the opportunity    not the responsibility  but the opportunity    to really get involved in making change. I'm adding that to my time. So what you don't know is  we've got these thousands of designers working around the world  connected basically by a website  and we have a staff of three. The fact that nobody told us we couldn't do it  we did it. And so there's something to be said about na vet . So seven years later  we've developed so that we've got advocacy  instigation and implementation. We advocate for good design  not only through student workshops and lectures and public forums  op eds  we have a book on humanitarian work  but also disaster mitigation and dealing with public policy. We can talk about FEMA  but that's another talk. Instigation  developing ideas with communities and NGOs  doing open source design competitions. Referring  matchmaking with communities. And then implementing    actually going out there and doing the work  because when you invent  it's never a reality until it's built. So it's really important that if we're designing and trying to create change  we build that change. So here's a select number of projects. Kosovo. This is Kosovo in '  . We did an open design competition  like I said. It led to a whole variety of ideas. And this wasn't about emergency shelter  but transitional shelter that would last five to    years  that would be placed next to the land the resident lived in  and that they would rebuild their own home. This wasn't imposing an architecture on a community  this was giving them the tools and the space to allow them to rebuild and regrow the way they want to. We had from the sublime to the ridiculous  but they worked. This is an inflatable hemp house. It was built  it works. This is a shipping container. Built and works. And a whole variety of ideas that not only dealt with architectural building  but also the issues of governance  and the idea of creating communities through complex networks. So we've engaged not just designers  but also a whole variety of technology based professionals. Using rubble from destroyed homes to create new homes. Using straw bale construction  creating heat walls. And then something remarkable happened in '  . We went to Africa originally to look at the housing issue. Within three days  we realized the problem was not housing  it was the growing pandemic of HIV AIDS. And it wasn't doctors telling us this  it was actual villagers that we were staying with. And so we came up with the bright idea that instead of getting people to walk        kilometers to see doctors  you get the doctors to the people. And we started engaging the medical community  and you know  we thought we were real bright sparks     We've come up with this great idea  mobile health clinics  widely distributed throughout sub Saharan Africa.  And the medical community there said   We've said this for the last decade. We know this. We just don't know how to show this.  So in a way  we had taken pre existing needs and shown solutions. And so again  we had a whole variety of ideas that came in. This one I personally love  because the idea is that architecture is not just about solutions  but about raising awareness. This is a kenaf clinic. You get seed and you grow it in a plot of land  and it grows    feet in a month. And on the fourth week  the doctors come and they mow out an area  put a tensile structure on the top  and when the doctors have finished treating and seeing patients and villagers  you cut down the clinic and you eat it. It's an eat your own clinic. So it's dealing with the fact that if you have AIDS  you also need to have nutrition rates  and the idea of nutrition is as important as getting antiretrovirals out there. So you know  this is a serious solution. This one I love. The idea is it's not just a clinic  it's a community center. This looked at setting up trade routes and economic engines within the community  so it can be a self sustaining project. Every one of these projects is sustainable. That's not because I'm a tree hugging green person. It's because when you live on four dollars a day  you're living on survival and you have to be sustainable. You have to know where your energy is coming from  you have to know where your resource is coming from  and you have to keep the maintenance down. So this is about getting an economic engine  and then at night  it turns into a movie theater. So it's not an AIDS clinic. It's a community center. So you can see ideas. And these ideas developed into prototypes  and they were eventually built. And currently  as of this year  there are clinics rolling out in Nigeria and Kenya. From that  we also developed Siyathemba. The community came to us and said   The problem is that the girls don't have education.  And we're working in an area where young women between the ages of    and    have a    percent HIV AIDS rate. And that's not because they're promiscuous  it's because there's no knowledge. And so we decided to look at the idea of sports  and create a youth sports center that doubled as an HIV AIDS outreach center  and the coaches of the girls' team were also trained doctors. So that there would be a very slow way of developing confidence in health care. And we picked nine finalists  and then those nine finalists were distributed throughout the entire region  and then the community picked their design. They said  this is our design  because it's not only about engaging a community  it's about empowering a community  and about getting them to be a part of the rebuilding process. So  the winning design is here. And then  of course  we actually go and work with the community and the clients. So this is the designer. He's out there working with the first ever women's soccer team in KwaZulu Natal  Siyathemba. And they can tell it better. Video  Well  my name is Cee Cee Mkhonza. I work at the Africa Centre  I'm an IT user consultant. I'm also the national football player for South Africa  Banyana Banyana. And I also play in the Vodacom League  for the team called Tembisa  which has now changed to Siyathemba. This is our home ground. Cameron Sinclair  I'm going to show that later because I'm running out of time. I can see Chris looking at me slyly. This was a connection  just a meeting with somebody who wanted to develop Africa's first telemedicine center  in Tanzania. And we met  literally  a couple of months ago. We've already developed a design. The team is over there  working in partnership. This was a matchmaking  thanks to a couple of TEDsters    Sun  Microsystems   Cheryl Heller and Andrew Zolli  who connected me with this amazing African woman. And we start construction in June  and it will be opened by TEDGlobal. So when you come to TEDGlobal  you can check it out. But what we're known probably most for is dealing with disasters and development  and we've been involved in a lot of issues  such as the tsunami and also things like Hurricane Katrina. This is a     dollar shelter that can be easily assembled. This is a community designed community center. And what that means is we actually live and work with the community  and they're part of the design process. The kids actually get involved in mapping out where the community center should be. And then eventually  the community  through skills training  end up building the building with us. Here is another school. This is what the UN gave these guys for six months       plastic tarps. This was in August. This was the replacement  that's supposed to last for two years. When the rain comes down  you can't hear a thing  and in the summer  it's about     degrees inside. So we said  if the rain's coming down  let's get fresh water. So every one of our schools has a rainwater collection system. Very low cost  three classrooms and rainwater collection is       dollars. This was raised by hot chocolate sales in Atlanta. It's built by the parents of the kids. The kids are out there on site  building the buildings. And it opened a couple of weeks ago  and there's     kids that are now using the schools. So  disaster hits home. We see the bad stories on CNN and Fox and all that  but we don't see the good stories. Here is a community that got together  and they said  no  to waiting. They formed a partnership  a diverse partnership of players  to actually map out East Biloxi  to figure out who's getting involved. We've had over       volunteers rebuilding  rehabbing homes. Figuring out what FEMA regulations are  not waiting for them to dictate to us how you should rebuild. Working with residents  getting them out of their homes  so they don't get ill. This is what they're cleaning up on their own. Designing housing. This house is going in in a couple of weeks. This is a rehabbed home  done in four days. This is a utility room for a woman who is on a walker. She's    years old. This is what FEMA gave her.     bucks  happened two days ago. We put together  very quickly  a washroom. It's built  it's running and she just started a business today  where she's washing other people's clothes. These are the Calhouns. They're photographers who had documented the Lower Ninth for the last    years. That was their home  and these are the photographs they took. And we're helping  working with them to create a new building. Projects we've done. Projects we've been a part of  support. Why don't aid agencies do this  This is the UN tent. This is the new UN tent  just introduced this year. Quick to assemble. It's got a flap    that's the invention. It took    years to design this and get it implemented in the field. I was    years old. There's a problem here. Luckily  we're not alone. There are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of architects and designers and inventors around the world that are getting involved in humanitarian work. More hemp houses    it's a theme in Japan  apparently. I'm not sure what they're smoking. This is a Grip Clip  designed by somebody who said   All you need is some way to attach membrane structures to physical support beams.  This guy designed for NASA  is now doing housing. I'm going to whip through this quickly  because I know I've got only a couple of minutes. So this is all done in the last two years. I showed you something that took    years to do. And this is just a selection of things that were built in the last couple of years. From Brazil to India  Mexico  Alabama  China  Israel  Palestine  Vietnam. The average age of a designer who gets involved in this project is       that's how old I am. So it's a young    I just have to stop here  because Arup is in the room  and this is the best designed toilet in the world. If you're ever  ever in India  go use this toilet. Chris Luebkeman will tell you why. I'm sure that's how he wanted to spend the party. But the future is not going to be the sky scraping cities of New York  but this. And when you look at this  you see crisis. What I see is many  many inventors. One billion people live in abject poverty. We hear about them all the time. Four billion live in growing but fragile economies. One in seven live in unplanned settlements. If we do nothing about the housing crisis that's about to happen  in    years  one in three people will live in an unplanned settlement or a refugee camp. Look left  look right  one of you will be there. How do we improve the living standards of five billion people  With    million solutions. So I wish to develop a community that actively embraces innovative and sustainable design to improve the living conditions for everyone. Chris Anderson  Wait a sec    that's your wish  CS  That's my wish. CA  That's his wish  CS  We started Architecture for Humanity with     dollars and a website. So Chris somehow decided to give me        . So why not this many people  Open source architecture is the way to go. You have a diverse community of participants    and we're not just talking about inventors and designers  but we're talking about the funding model. My role is not as a designer  it's as a conduit between the design world and the humanitarian world. And what we need is something that replicates me globally  because I haven't slept in seven years. Secondly  what will this thing be  Designers want to respond to issues of humanitarian crisis  but they don't want some company in the West taking their idea and basically profiting from it. So Creative Commons has developed the Developing Nations license. And what that means is that a designer can    The Siyathemba project I showed was the first ever building to have a Creative Commons license on it. As soon as that is built  anyone in Africa or any developing nation can take the construction documents and replicate it for free. So why not allow designers the opportunity to do this  but still protect their rights here  We want to have a community where you can upload ideas  and those ideas can be tested in an earthquake  in flood  in all sorts of austere environments. The reason that's important is I don't want to wait for the next Katrina to find out if my house works. That's too late  we need to do it now. So doing that globally    and I want this whole thing to work multi lingually. When you look at the face of an architect  most people think a gray haired white guy. I don't see that  I see the face of the world. So I want everyone from all over the planet to be able to be a part of this design and development. The idea of needs based competitions    XPRIZE for the other    percent  if you want to call it that. We also want to look at ways of matchmaking and putting funding partners together  and the idea of integrating manufacturers    fab labs in every country. When I hear about the      laptop and it's going to educate every child    educate every designer in the world. Put one in every favela  every slum settlement. Because you know what  Innovation will happen. And I need to know that. It's called the leap back. We talk about leapfrog technologies. I write with Worldchanging  and the one thing we've been talking about is  I learn more on the ground than I've ever learned here. So let's take those ideas  adapt them  and we can use them. These ideas are supposed to be adaptable  they should have the potential for evolution  they should be developed by every nation in the world and useful for every nation in the world. What will it take  There should be a sheet. I don't have time to read this  because I'm going to be yanked off. CA  Let's just leave it up for a sec. CS  Well  what will it take  You guys are smart. So it's going to take a lot of computing power  because I want the idea that any laptop anywhere in the world can plug into the system and be able to not only participate in developing these designs  but utilize the designs. Also  a process of reviewing the designs. I want every Arup engineer in the world to check and make sure that we're doing stuff that's standing  because those guys are the best in the world. Plug. And so  you know  I want these    I just should note  I have two laptops and one of them is there  and that has      designs on it. If I drop that laptop ... What happens  So it's important to have these proven ideas put up there  easy to use  easy to get ahold of. My mom once said   There's nothing worse than being all mouth and no trousers.  I'm fed up of talking about making change. You only make it by doing it. We've changed FEMA guidelines  we've changed public policy  we've changed international response    based on building things. So for me  it's important that we create a real conduit for innovation  and that it's free innovation. Think of free culture    this is free innovation. Somebody said this a couple of years back. I will give points for those who know it. But I think the man was maybe    years too early. So let's do it. Thank you. I can't help but this wish  to think about when you're a little kid  and all your friends ask you   If a genie could give you one wish in the world  what would it be   And I always answered   Well  I'd want the wish to have the wisdom to know exactly what to wish for.  Well  then you'd be screwed  because you'd know what to wish for  and you'd use up your wish  and now  since we only have one wish    unlike last year they had three wishes    I'm not going to wish for that. So let's get to what I would like  which is world peace. And I know what you're thinking  You're thinking   The poor girl up there  she thinks she's at a beauty pageant. She's not. She's at the TED Prize.  But I really do think it makes sense. And I think that the first step to world peace is for people to meet each other. I've met a lot of different people over the years  and I've filmed some of them  from a dotcom executive in New York who wanted to take over the world  to a military press officer in Qatar  who would rather not take over the world. If you've seen the film  Control Room  that was sent out  you'd understand a little bit why. Thank you. Wow  Some of you watched it. That's great. That's great. So basically what I'd like to talk about today is a way for people to travel  to meet people in a different way than    because you can't travel all over the world at the same time. And a long time ago    well  about    years ago    my mom had an exchange student. And I'm going to show you slides of the exchange student. This is Donna. This is Donna at the Statue of Liberty. This is my mother and aunt teaching Donna how to ride a bike. This is Donna eating ice cream. And this is Donna teaching my aunt how to do a Filipino dance. I really think as the world is getting smaller  it becomes more and more important that we learn each other's dance moves  that we meet each other  we get to know each other  we are able to figure out a way to cross borders  to understand each other  to understand people's hopes and dreams  what makes them laugh and cry. And I know that we can't all do exchange programs  and I can't force everybody to travel  I've already talked about that to Chris and Amy  and they said that there's a problem with this  You can't force people  free will. And I totally support that  so we're not forcing people to travel. But I'd like to talk about another way to travel that doesn't require a ship or an airplane  and just requires a movie camera  a projector and a screen. And that's what I'm going to talk to you about today. I was asked that I speak a little bit about where I personally come from  and Cameron  I don't know how you managed to get out of that one  but I think that building bridges is important to me because of where I come from. I'm the daughter of an American mother and an Egyptian Lebanese Syrian father. So I'm the living product of two cultures coming together. No pun intended. And I've also been called  as an Egyptian Lebanese Syrian American with a Persian name  the  Middle East Peace Crisis.  So maybe me starting to take pictures was some kind of way to bring both sides of my family together    a way to take the worlds with me  a way to tell stories visually. It all kind of started that way  but I think that I really realized the power of the image when I first went to the garbage collecting village in Egypt  when I was about   . My mother took me there. She's somebody who believes strongly in community service  and decided that this was something that I needed to do. And so I went there and I met some amazing women there. There was a center there  where they were teaching people how to read and write  and get vaccinations against the many diseases you can get from sorting through garbage. And I began teaching there. I taught English  and I met some incredible women there. I met people that live seven people to a room  barely can afford their evening meal  yet lived with this strength of spirit and sense of humor and just incredible qualities. I got drawn into this community and I began to take pictures there. I took pictures of weddings and older family members    things that they wanted memories of. About two years after I started taking these pictures  the UN Conference on Population and Development asked me to show them at the conference. So I was     I was very excited. It was my first exhibit of photographs and they were all put up there  and after about two days  they all came down except for three. People were very upset  very angry that I was showing these dirty sides of Cairo  and why didn't I cut the dead donkey out of the frame  And as I sat there  I got very depressed. I looked at this big empty wall with three lonely photographs that were  you know  very pretty photographs and I was like   I failed at this.  But I was looking at this intense emotion and intense feeling that had come out of people just seeing these photographs. Here I was  this    year old pipsqueak that nobody listened to  and all of a sudden  I put these photographs on the wall  and there were arguments  and they had to be taken down. And I saw the power of the image  and it was incredible. And I think the most important reaction that I saw there was actually from people that would never have gone to the garbage village themselves  that would never have seen that the human spirit could thrive in such difficult circumstances. And I think it was at that point that I decided I wanted to use photography and film to somehow bridge gaps  to bridge cultures  bring people together  cross borders. And so that's what really kind of started me off. Did a stint at MTV  made a film called  Startup.com   and I've done a couple of music films. But in       when the war in Iraq was about to start  it was a very surreal feeling for me  because before the war started  there was kind of this media war that was going on. And I was watching television in New York  and there seemed to be just one point of view that was coming across  and the coverage went from the US State Department to embedded troops. And what was coming across on the news was that there was going to be this clean war and precision bombings  and the Iraqis would be greeting the Americans as liberators  and throwing flowers at their feet in the streets of Baghdad. And I knew that there was a completely other story that was taking place in the Middle East  where my parents were. I knew that there was a completely other story being told  and I was thinking   How are people supposed to communicate with each other when they're getting completely different messages  and nobody knows what the other's being told  How are people supposed to have any kind of common understanding or know how to move together into the future  So I knew that I had to go there. I just wanted to be in the center. I had no plan. I had no funding. I didn't even have a camera at the time    I had somebody bring it there  because I wanted to get access to Al Jazeera  George Bush's favorite channel  and a place which I was very curious about because it's disliked by many governments across the Arab world  and also called the mouthpiece of Osama Bin Laden by some people in the US government. So I was thinking  this station that's hated by so many people has to be doing something right. I've got to go see what this is all about. And I also wanted to go see Central Command  which was    minutes away. And that way  I could get access to how this news was being created    on the Arab side  reaching the Arab world  and on the US and Western side  reaching the US. And when I went there and sat there  and met these people that were in the center of it  and sat with these characters  I met some surprising  very complex people. And I'd like to share with you a little bit of that experience of when you sit with somebody and you film them  and you listen to them  and you allow them more than a five second sound bite. The amazing complexity of people emerges. Samir Khader  Business as usual. Iraq  and then Iraq  and then Iraq. But between us  if I'm offered a job with Fox  I'll take it. To change the Arab nightmare into the American dream. I still have that dream. Maybe I will never be able to do it  but I have plans for my children. When they finish high school  I will send them to America to study there. I will pay for their study. And they will stay there. Josh Rushing  The night they showed the POWs and the dead soldiers    Al Jazeera showed them    it was powerful  because America doesn't show those kinds of images. Most of the news in America won't show really gory images and this showed American soldiers in uniform  strewn about a floor  a cold tile floor. And it was revolting. It was absolutely revolting. It made me sick at my stomach. And then what hit me was  the night before  there had been some kind of bombing in Basra  and Al Jazeera had shown images of the people. And they were equally  if not more  horrifying    the images were. And I remember having seen it in the Al Jazeera office  and thought to myself   Wow  that's gross. That's bad.  And then going away  and probably eating dinner or something. And it didn't affect me as much. So  the impact that had on me    me realizing that I just saw people on the other side  and those people in the Al Jazeera office must have felt the way I was feeling that night  and it upset me on a profound level that I wasn't as bothered as much the night before. It makes me hate war. But it doesn't make me believe that we're in a world that can live without war yet. Jehane Noujaim  I was overwhelmed by the response of the film. We didn't know whether it would be able to get out there. We had no funding for it. We were incredibly lucky that it got picked up. And when we showed the film in both the United States and the Arab world  we had such incredible reactions. It was amazing to see how people were moved by this film. In the Arab world    and it's not really by the film  it's by the characters    I mean  Josh Rushing was this incredibly complex person who was thinking about things. And when I showed the film in the Middle East  people wanted to meet Josh. He kind of redefined us as an American population. People started to ask me   Where is this guy now   Al Jazeera offered him a job. And Samir  on the other hand  was also quite an interesting character for the Arab world to see  because it brought out the complexities of this love hate relationship that the Arab world has with the West. In the United States  I was blown away by the motivations  the positive motivations of the American people when they'd see this film. You know  we're criticized abroad for believing we're the saviors of the world in some way  but the flip side of it is that  actually  when people do see what is happening abroad and people's reactions to some of our policy abroad  we feel this power  that we need to    we feel like we have to get the power to change things. And I saw this with audiences. This woman came up to me after the screening and said   You know  I know this is crazy. I saw the bombs being loaded on the planes  I saw the military going out to war  but you don't understand people's anger towards us until you see the people in the hospitals and the victims of the war  and how do we get out of this bubble  How do we understand what the other person is thinking   Now  I don't know whether a film can change the world. But I know the power of it  I know that it starts people thinking about how to change the world. Now  I'm not a philosopher  so I feel like I shouldn't go into great depth on this  but let film speak for itself and take you to this other world. Because I believe that film has the ability to take you across borders  I'd like you to just sit back and experience for a couple of minutes being taken into another world. And these couple clips take you inside of two of the most difficult conflicts that we're faced with today.  The last    hours of two Palestinian suicide bombers.   Paradise Now   Man  As long as there is injustice  someone must make a sacrifice    Woman  That's no sacrifice  that's revenge    If you kill  there's no difference between victim and occupier.   Man  If we had airplanes  we wouldn't need martyrs  that's the difference.   Woman  The difference is that the Israeli military is still stronger.   Man  Then let us be equal in death.   We still have Paradise.   Woman  There is no Paradise  It only exists in your head    Man  God forbid    May God forgive you.   If you were not Abu Azzam's daughter ...   Anyway  I'd rather have Paradise in my head than live in this hell    In this life  we're dead anyway.   One only chooses bitterness when the alternative is even bitterer.   Woman  And what about us  The ones who remain    Will we win that way    Don't you see what you're doing is destroying us    And that you give Israel an alibi to carry on    Man  So with no alibi  Israel will stop    Woman  Perhaps. We have to turn it into a moral war.   Man  How  if Israel has no morals    Woman  Be careful    And the real people building peace through non violence   Encounter Point  Video   Ambulance siren   Tel Aviv  Israel        Tzvika  My wife Ayelet called me and said      There was a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv.    Ayelet  What do you know about the casualties    Tzvika off screen  We're looking for three girls.   We have no information.   Ayelet  One is wounded here  but we haven't heard from the other three.   Tzvika  I said   OK  that's Bat Chen  that's my daughter.   Are you sure she is dead     They said yes.  Video   Police siren and shouting over megaphone   Bethlehem  Occupied Palestinian Territories         George  On that day  at around        I was driving with my wife and daughters to the supermarket.   When we got to here ...   we saw three Israeli military jeeps parked on the side of the road.   When we passed by the first jeep ...   they opened fire on us.   And my    year old daughter Christine   was killed in the shooting.   Bereaved Families Forum  Jerusalem   Tzvika  I'm the headmaster for all parts.   George  But there is a teacher that is in charge    Tzvika  Yes  I have assistants.   I deal with children all the time.   One year after their daughters' deaths both Tzvika and George join the forum   George  At first  I thought it was a strange idea.   But after thinking logically about it     I didn't find any reason why not to meet them   and let them know of our suffering.   Tzvika  There were many things that touched me.   We see that there are Palestinians who suffered a lot  who lost children    and still believe in the peace process and in reconciliation.   If we who lost what is most precious can talk to each other    and look forward to a better future    then everyone else must do so  too.   From South Africa  A Revolution Through Music   Amandla  who otherwise would not have understood where we're coming from. You could give them a long political speech  they would still not understand. But I tell you  when you finish that song  people will be like   Damn  I know where you niggas are coming from. I know where you guys are coming from. Death unto apartheid   Narrator  It's about the liberation struggle. It's about those children who took to the streets    fighting  screaming   Free Nelson Mandela   It's about those unions who put down their tools and demanded freedom. Yes. Yes  Jehane Noujaim  I think everybody's had that feeling of sitting in a theater  in a dark room  with other strangers  watching a very powerful film  and they felt that feeling of transformation. And what I'd like to talk about is how can we use that feeling to actually create a movement through film  I've been listening to the talks in the conference  and Robert Wright said yesterday that if we have an appreciation for another person's humanity  then they will have an appreciation for ours. And that's what this is about. It's about connecting people through film  getting these independent voices out there. Now  Josh Rushing actually ended up leaving the military and taking a job with Al Jazeera. So his feeling is that he's at Al Jazeera International because he feels like he can actually use media to bridge the gap between East and West. And that's an amazing thing. But I've been trying to think about ways to give power to these independent voices  to give power to the filmmakers  to give power to people who are trying to use film for change. And there are incredible organizations that are out there doing this already. There's Witness  that you heard from earlier. There's Just Vision  that are working with Palestinians and Israelis who are working together for peace  and documenting that process and getting interviews out there and using this film to take to Congress to show that it's a powerful tool  to show that this is a woman who's had her daughter killed in an attack  and she believes that there are peaceful ways to solve this. There's Working Films and there's Current TV  which is an incredible platform for people around the world to be able to put their    Yeah  it's amazing. I've watched it and I'm blown away by it and its potential to bring voices from around the world    independent voices from around the world    and create a truly democratic  global television. So what can we do to create a platform for these organizations  to create some momentum  to get everybody in the world involved in this movement  I'd like for us to imagine for a second. Imagine a day when you have everyone coming together from around the world. You have towns and villages and theaters    all from around the world  getting together  and sitting in the dark  and sharing a communal experience of watching a film  or a couple of films  together. Watching a film which maybe highlights a character that is fighting to live  or just a character that defies stereotypes  makes a joke  sings a song. Comedies  documentaries  shorts. This amazing power can be used to change people and to bond people together  to cross borders  and have people feel like they're having a communal experience. So if you imagine this day when all around the world  you have theaters and places where we project films. If you imagine projecting from Times Square to Tahrir Square in Cairo  the same film in Ramallah  the same film in Jerusalem. You know  we've been talking to a friend of mine about using the side of the Great Pyramid and the Great Wall of China. It's endless what you can imagine  in terms of where you can project films and where you can have this communal experience. And I believe that this one day  if we can create it  this one day can create momentum for all of these independent voices. There isn't an organization which is connecting the independent voices of the world to get out there  and yet I'm hearing throughout this conference that the biggest challenge in our future is understanding the other  and having mutual respect for the other and crossing borders. And if film can do that  and if we can get all of these different locations in the world to watch these films together    this could be an incredible day. So we've already made a partnership  set up through somebody from the TED community  John Camen  who introduced me to Steven Apkon  from the Jacob Burns Film Center. And we started calling up everybody. And in the last week  there have been so many people that have responded to us  from as close as Palo Alto  to Mongolia and to India. There are people that want to be a part of this global day of film  to be able to provide a platform for independent voices and independent films to get out there. Now  we've thought about a name for this day  and I'd like to share this with you. Now  the most amazing part of this whole process has been sharing ideas and wishes  and so I invite you to give brainstorms onto how does this day echo into the future  How do we use technology to make this day echo into the future  so that we can build community and have these communities working together  through the Internet  There was a time  many  many years ago  when all of the continents were stuck together. And we call that landmass Pangea. So what we'd like to call this day of film is Pangea Cinema Day. And if you just imagine that all of these people in these towns would be watching  then I think that we can actually really make a movement towards people understanding each other better. I know that it's very intangible  touching people's hearts and souls  but the only way that I know how to do it  the only way that I know how to reach out to somebody's heart and soul all across the world  is by showing them a film. And I know that there are independent filmmakers and films out there that can really make this happen. And that's my wish. I guess I'm supposed to give you my one sentence wish  but we're way out of time. Chris Anderson  That is an incredible wish. Pangea Cinema  The day the world comes together. JN  It's more tangible than world peace  and it's certainly more immediate. But it would be the day that the world comes together through film  the power of film. CA  Ladies and gentlemen  Jehane Noujaim. I'm the luckiest guy in the world. I got to see the last case of killer smallpox in the world. I was in India this past year  and I may have seen the last cases of polio in the world. There's nothing that makes you feel more    the blessing and the honor of working in a program like that    than to know that something that horrible no longer exists. So I'm going to tell you    so I'm going to show you some dirty pictures. They are difficult to watch  but you should look at them with optimism  because the horror of these pictures will be matched by the uplifting quality of knowing that they no longer exist. But first  I'm going to tell you a little bit about my own journey. My background is not exactly the conventional medical education that you might expect. When I was an intern in San Francisco  I heard about a group of Native Americans who had taken over Alcatraz Island  and a Native American who wanted to give birth on that island  and no other doctor wanted to go and help her give birth. I went out to Alcatraz  and I lived on the island for several weeks. She gave birth  I caught the baby  I got off the island  I landed in San Francisco  and all the press wanted to talk to me  because my three weeks on the island made me an expert in Indian affairs. I wound up on every television show. Someone saw me on television  they called me up  and they asked me if I'd like to be in a movie and to play a young doctor for a bunch of rock and roll stars who were traveling in a bus ride from San Francisco to England. And I said  yes  I would do that  so I became the doctor in an absolutely awful movie called  Medicine Ball Caravan.  Now  you know from the '  s  you're either on the bus or you're off the bus  I was on the bus. My wife of    years and I joined the bus. Our bus ride took us from San Francisco to London  then we switched buses at the big pond. We then got on two more buses and we drove through Turkey and Iran  Afghanistan  over the Khyber Pass into Pakistan  like every other young doctor. This is us at the Khyber Pass  and that's our bus. We had some difficulty getting over the Khyber Pass. But we wound up in India. And then  like everyone else in our generation  we went to live in a Himalayan monastery. This is just like a residency program  for those of you that are in medical school. And we studied with a wise man  a guru named Karoli Baba  who then told me to get rid of the dress  put on a three piece suit  go join the United Nations as a diplomat and work for the World Health Organization. And he made an outrageous prediction that smallpox would be eradicated  and that this was God's gift to humanity  because of the hard work of dedicated scientists. And that prediction came true. This little girl is Rahima Banu  and she was the last case of killer smallpox in the world. And this document is the certificate that the global commission signed  certifying the world to have eradicated the first disease in history. The key to eradicating smallpox was early detection  early response. I'm going to ask you to repeat that  early detection  early response. Can you say that  Audience  Early detection  early response. Larry Brilliant  Smallpox was the worst disease in history. It killed more people than all the wars in history. In the last century  it killed     million people. You're reading about Larry Page already. Somebody reads very fast. In the year that Larry Page and Sergey Brin    with whom I have a certain affection and a new affiliation    in the year in which they were born  two million people died of smallpox. We declared smallpox eradicated in     . This is the most important slide that I've ever seen in public health   Sovereigns killed by smallpox  because it shows you to be the richest and the strongest  and to be kings and queens of the world  did not protect you from dying of smallpox. Never can you doubt that we are all in this together. But to see smallpox from the perspective of a sovereign is the wrong perspective. You should see it from the perspective of a mother  watching her child develop this disease and standing by helplessly. Day one  day two  day three  day four  day five  day six. You're a mother and you're watching your child  and on day six  you see pustules that become hard. Day seven  they show the classic scars of smallpox umbilication. Day eight. And Al Gore said earlier that the most photographed image in the world  the most printed image in the world  was that of the Earth. But this was in       and as of that moment  this photograph was the photograph that was the most widely printed  because we printed two billion copies of this photograph  and we took them hand to hand  door to door  to show people and ask them if there was smallpox in their house  because that was our surveillance system. We didn't have Google  we didn't have web crawlers  we didn't have computers. By day nine    you look at this picture and you're horrified  I look at this picture and I say   Thank God   because it's clear that this is only an ordinary case of smallpox  and I know this child will live. And by day     the lesions are scabbing  his eyelids are swollen  but you know this child has no other secondary infection. And by day     while he will be scarred for life  he will live. There are other kinds of smallpox that are not like that. This is confluent smallpox  in which there isn't a single place on the body where you could put a finger and not be covered by lesions. Flat smallpox  which killed     percent of people who got it. And hemorrhagic smallpox  the most cruel of all  which had a predilection for pregnant women. I've probably had    women die. They all had hemorrhagic smallpox. I've never seen anybody die from it who wasn't a pregnant woman. In       the WHO embarked on what was an outrageous program to eradicate a disease. In that year  there were    countries affected with smallpox. By       we were down to    countries.       we were down to five countries. But in that year  smallpox exploded throughout India. And India was the place where smallpox made its last stand. In       India had a population of     million. There are    linguistic states in India  which is like saying    different countries. There are    million people on the road at any time  in buses and trains  walking          villages      million households  and none of them wanted to report if they had a case of smallpox in their house  because they thought that smallpox was the visitation of a deity  Shitala Mata  the cooling mother  and it was wrong to bring strangers into your house when the deity was in the house. No incentive to report smallpox. It wasn't just India that had smallpox deities  smallpox deities were prevalent all over the world. So  how we eradicated smallpox was    max vaccination wouldn't work. You could vaccinate everybody in India  but one year later there'd be    million new babies  which was then the population of Canada. It wouldn't do just to vaccinate everyone. You had to find every single case of smallpox in the world at the same time  and draw a circle of immunity around it. And that's what we did. In India alone  my         best friends and I went door to door  with that same picture  to every single house in India. We made over one billion house calls. And in the process  I learned something very important. Every time we did a house to house search  we had a spike in the number of reports of smallpox. When we didn't search  we had the illusion that there was no disease. When we did search  we had the illusion that there was more disease. A surveillance system was necessary  because what we needed was early detection  early response. So we searched and we searched  and we found every case of smallpox in India. We had a reward. We raised the reward. We continued to increase the reward. We had a scorecard that we wrote on every house. And as we did that  the number of reported cases in the world dropped to zero. And in       we declared the globe free of smallpox. It was the largest campaign in United Nations history  until the Iraq war.         people from all over the world    doctors of every race  religion  culture and nation  who fought side by side  brothers and sisters  with each other  not against each other  in a common cause to make the world better. But smallpox was the fourth disease that was intended for eradication. We failed three other times. We failed against malaria  yellow fever and yaws. But soon we may see polio eradicated. But the key to eradicating polio is early detection  early response. This may be the year we eradicate polio. That will make it the second disease in history. And David Heymann  who's watching this on the webcast    David  keep on going. We're close  We're down to four countries. I feel like Hank Aaron. Barry Bonds can replace me any time. Let's get another disease off the list of terrible things to worry about. I was just in India working on the polio program. The polio surveillance program is four million people going door to door. That is the surveillance system. But we need to have early detection  early response. Blindness  the same thing. The key to discovering blindness is doing epidemiological surveys and finding out the causes of blindness  so you can mount the correct response. The Seva Foundation was started by a group of alumni of the Smallpox Eradication Programme  who  having climbed the highest mountain  tasted the elixir of the success of eradicating a disease  wanted to do it again. And over the last    years  Seva's programs in    countries have given back sight to more than two million blind people. Seva got started because we wanted to apply these lessons of surveillance and epidemiology to something which nobody else was looking at as a public health issue  blindness  which heretofore had been thought of only as a clinical disease. In       Steve Jobs gave me that computer  which is Apple number     and it's still in Kathmandu  and it's still working  and we ought to go get it and auction it off and make more money for Seva. And we conducted the first Nepal survey ever done for health  and the first nationwide blindness survey ever done  and we had astonishing results. Instead of finding out what we thought was the case    that blindness was caused mostly by glaucoma and trachoma    we were astounded to find out that blindness was caused instead by cataract. You can't cure or prevent what you don't know is there. In your TED packages there's a DVD   Infinite Vision   about Dr. V and the Aravind Eye Hospital. I hope that you will take a look at it. Aravind  which started as a Seva project  is now the world's largest and best eye hospital. This year  that one hospital will give back sight to more than         people in Tamil Nadu  India. Bird flu. I stand here as a representative of all terrible things    this might be the worst. The key to preventing or mitigating pandemic bird flu is early detection and rapid response. We will not have a vaccine or adequate supplies of an antiviral to combat bird flu if it occurs in the next three years. WHO stages the progress of a pandemic. We are now at stage three on the pandemic alert stage  with just a little bit of human to human transmission  but no human to human to human sustained transmission. The moment WHO says we've moved to category four    this will not be like Katrina. The world as we know it will stop. There'll be no airplanes flying. Would you get in an airplane with     people you didn't know  coughing and sneezing  when you knew that some of them might carry a disease that could kill you  for which you had no antivirals or vaccine  I did a study of the top epidemiologists in the world in October. I asked them    these are all fluologists and specialists in influenza    and I asked them the questions you'd like to ask them  What do you think the likelihood is that there'll be a pandemic  If it happens  how bad do you think it will be  Fifteen percent said they thought there'd be a pandemic within three years. But much worse than that     percent said they thought there'd be a pandemic within your children or your grandchildren's lifetime. And they thought that if there was a pandemic  a billion people would get sick. As many as     million people would die. There would be a global recession and depression as our just in time inventory system and the tight rubber band of globalization broke  and the cost to our economy of one to three trillion dollars would be far worse for everyone than merely     million people dying  because so many more people would lose their job and their healthcare benefits  that the consequences are almost unthinkable. And it's getting worse  because travel is getting so much better. Let me show you a simulation of what a pandemic looks like. So we know what we're talking about. Let's assume  for example  that the first case occurs in South Asia. It initially goes quite slowly. You get two or three discrete locations. Then there'll be secondary outbreaks  and the disease will spread from country to country so fast that you won't know what hit you. Within three weeks it will be everywhere in the world. Now  if we had an  undo  button  and we could go back and isolate it and grab it when it first started    if we could find it early  and we had early detection and early response  and we could put each one of those viruses in jail    that's the only way to deal with something like a pandemic. And let me show you why that is. We have a joke. This is an epidemic curve  and everyone in medicine  I think  ultimately gets to know what it is. But the joke is  an epidemiologist likes to arrive at an epidemic right here and ride to glory on the downhill curve. But you don't get to do that usually. You usually arrive right about here. What we really want is to arrive right here  so we can stop the epidemic. But you can't always do that. But there's an organization that has been able to find a way to learn when the first cases occur  and that is called GPHIN  it's the Global Public Health Information Network. And that simulation that I showed you that you thought was bird flu    that was SARS. And SARS is the pandemic that did not occur. And it didn't occur because GPHIN found the pandemic to be of SARS three months before WHO actually announced it  and because of that  we were able to stop the SARS pandemic. And I think we owe a great debt of gratitude to GPHIN and to Ron St. John  who I hope is in the audience some place    over there    who's the founder of GPHIN. Hello  Ron  And TED has flown Ron here from Ottawa  where GPHIN is located  because not only did GPHIN find SARS early  but you may have seen last week that Iran announced that they had bird flu in Iran  but GPHIN found the bird flu in Iran not February       but last September. We need an early warning system to protect us against the things that are humanity's worst nightmare. And so my TED wish is based on the common denominator of these experiences. Smallpox    early detection  early response. Blindness  polio    early detection  early response. Pandemic bird flu    early detection  early response. It is a litany. It is so obvious that our only way of dealing with these new diseases is to find them early and to kill them before they spread. So  my TED wish is for you to help build a global system    an early warning system    to protect us against humanity's worst nightmares. And what I thought I would call it is  Early Detection   But it should really be called ...  Total Early Detection.   TED  What  What  But in all seriousness  because this idea is birthed in TED  I would like it to be a legacy of TED  and I'd like to call it the  International System for Total Early Disease Detection.   INSTEDD  And INSTEDD then becomes our mantra. So instead of a hidden pandemic of bird flu  we find it and immediately contain it. Instead of a novel virus caused by bio terror or bio error  or shift or drift  we find it and we contain it. Instead of industrial accidents like oil spills or the catastrophe in Bhopal  we find them  and we respond to them. Instead of famine  hidden until it is too late  we detect it  and we respond. And instead of a system which is owned by a government  and hidden in the bowels of government  let's build an early detection system that's freely available to anyone in the world in their own language. Let's make it transparent  non governmental  not owned by any single country or company  housed in a neutral country  with redundant backup in a different time zone and a different continent. And let's build it on GPHIN. Let's start with GPHIN. Let's increase the websites that they crawl from        to    million. Let's increase the languages they crawl from seven to     or more. Let's build in outbound confirmation messages  using text messages or SMS or instant messaging to find out from people who are within     meters of the rumor that you hear  if it is  in fact  valid. And let's add satellite confirmation. And we'll add Gapminder's amazing graphics to the front end. And we'll grow it as a moral force in the world  finding out those terrible things before anybody else knows about them  and sending our response to them  so that next year  instead of us meeting here  lamenting how many terrible things there are in the world  we will have pulled together  used the unique skills and the magic of this community  and be proud that we have done everything we can to stop pandemics  other catastrophes  and change the world  beginning right now. Chris Anderson  An amazing presentation. First of all  just so everyone understands  you're saying that by creating web crawlers  looking on the Internet for patterns  they can detect something suspicious before WHO  before anyone else can see it  Give an example of how that could possibly be true. Larry Brilliant  You're not mad about the copyright violation  CA  No. I love it. LB  Well  as Ron St. John    I hope you'll go and meet him in the dinner afterwards and talk to him. When he started GPHIN    In       there was an outbreak of bird flu    H N . It was in Hong Kong. And a remarkable doctor in Hong Kong responded immediately  by slaughtering  .  million chickens and birds  and they stopped that outbreak in its tracks. Immediate detection  immediate response. Then a number of years went by  and there were a lot of rumors about bird flu. Ron and his team in Ottawa began to crawl the web    only crawling        different websites  mostly periodicals    and they read about and heard about a concern  of a lot of children who had high fever and symptoms of bird flu. They reported this to WHO. WHO took a little while taking action  because WHO will only receive a report from a government  because it's the United Nations. But they were able to point to WHO and let them know that there was this surprising and unexplained cluster of illnesses that looked like bird flu. That turned out to be SARS. That's how the world found out about SARS. And because of that  we were able to stop SARS. Now  what's really important is that  before there was GPHIN      percent of all the world's reports of bad things    whether you're talking about famine or you're talking about bird flu or you're talking about Ebola        percent of all those reports came from nations. The moment these guys in Ottawa    on a budget of         dollars a year    got cracking     percent of all the reports in the world came from GPHIN     percent of all the reports in the world came from all the other     nations. Now  here's what's really interesting  after they'd been working for a couple years  what do you think happened to those nations  They felt pretty stupid. So they started sending in their reports early. And now  their reporting percentage is down to    percent  because other nations have started to report. So  can you find diseases early by crawling the web  Of course you can. Can you find it even earlier than GPHIN does now  Of course you can. You saw that they found SARS using their Chinese web crawler a full six weeks before they found it using their English web crawler. Well  they're only crawling in seven languages. These bad viruses really don't have any intention of showing up first in English or Spanish or French. So yes  I want to take GPHIN  I want to build on it. I want to add all the languages of the world that we possibly can. I want to make this open to everybody  so that the health officer in Nairobi or in Patna  Bihar will have as much access to it as the folks in Ottawa or in CDC. And I want to make it part of our culture that there is a community of people who are watching out for the worst nightmares of humanity  and that it's accessible to everyone. I'm going to present three projects in rapid fire. I don't have much time to do it. And I want to reinforce three ideas with that rapid fire presentation. The first is what I like to call a hyper rational process. It's a process that takes rationality almost to an absurd level  and it transcends all the baggage that normally comes with what people would call  sort of a rational conclusion to something. And it concludes in something that you see here  that you actually wouldn't expect as being the result of rationality. The second    the second is that this process does not have a signature. There is no authorship. Architects are obsessed with authorship. This is something that has editing and it has teams  but in fact  we no longer see within this process  the traditional master architect creating a sketch that his minions carry out. And the third is that it challenges    and this is  in the length of this  very hard to support why  connect all these things    but it challenges the high modernist notion of flexibility. High modernists said we will create sort of singular spaces that are generic  almost anything can happen within them. I call it sort of  shotgun flexibility     turn your head this way  shoot  and you're bound to kill something. So  this is the promise of high modernism  within a single space  actually  any kind of activity can happen. But as we're seeing  operational costs are starting to dwarf capital costs in terms of design parameters. And so  with this sort of idea  what happens is  whatever actually is in the building on opening day  or whatever seems to be the most immediate need  starts to dwarf the possibility and sort of subsume it  of anything else could ever happen. And so we're proposing a different kind of flexibility  something that we call  compartmentalized flexibility.  And the idea is that you  within that continuum  identify a series of points  and you design specifically to them. They can be pushed off center a little bit  but in the end you actually still get as much of that original spectrum as you originally had hoped. With high modernist flexibility  that doesn't really work. Now I'm going to talk about    I'm going to build up the Seattle Central Library in this way before your eyes in about five or six diagrams  and I truly mean this is the design process that you'll see. With the library staff and the library board  we settled on two core positions. This is the first one  and this is showing  over the last     years  the evolution of the book  and other technologies. This diagram was our sort of position piece about the book  and our position was  books are technology    that's something people forget    but it's a form of technology that will have to share its dominance with any other form of truly potent technology or media. The second premise    and this was something that was very difficult for us to convince the librarians of at first    is that libraries  since the inception of Carnegie Library tradition in America  had a second responsibility  and that was for social roles. Ok  now  this I'll come back to later  but something    actually  the librarians at first said   No  this isn't our mandate. Our mandate is media  and particularly the book.  So what you're seeing now is actually the design of the building. The upper diagram is what we had seen in a whole host of contemporary libraries that used high modernist flexibility. Sort of  any activity could happen anywhere. We don't know the future of the library  we don't know the future of the book  and so  we'll use this approach. And what we saw were buildings that were very generic  and worse    not only were they very generic    so  not only does the reading room look like the copy room look like the magazine area    but it meant that whatever issue was troubling the library at that moment was starting to engulf every other activity that was happening in it. And in this case  what was getting engulfed were these social responsibilities by the expansion of the book. And so we proposed what's at the lower diagram. Very dumb approach  simply compartmentalize. Put those things whose evolution we could predict    and I don't mean that we could say what would actually happen in the future  but we have some certainty of the spectrum of what would happen in the future    put those in boxes designed specifically for it  and put the things that we can't predict on the rooftops. So that was the core idea. Now  we had to convince the library that social roles were equally important to media  in order to get them to accept this. What you're seeing here is actually their program on the left. That's as it was given to us in all of its clarity and glory. Our first operation was to re digest it back to them  show it to them and say   You know what  We haven't touched it  but only one third of your own program is dedicated to media and books. Two thirds of it is already dedicated    that's the white band below  the thing you said isn't important    is already dedicated to social functions.  So once we had presented that back to them  they agreed that this sort of core concept could work. We got the right to go back to first principles    that's the third diagram. We recombined everything. And then we started making new decisions. What you're seeing on the right is the design of the library  specifically in terms of square footage. On the left of that diagram  here  you'll see a series of five platforms    sort of combs  collective programs. And on the right are the more indeterminate spaces  things like reading rooms  whose evolution in            years we can't predict. So that literally was the design of the building. They signed it  and to their chagrin  we came back a week later  and we presented them this. And as you can see  it is literally the diagram on the right. We just sized    no  really  I mean that  literally. The things on the left hand side of the diagram  those are the boxes. We sized them into five compartments. They're super efficient. We had a very low budget to work with. We pushed them around on the site to make very literal contextual relationships. The reading room should be able to see the water. The main entrance should have a public plaza in front of it to abide by the zoning code  and so forth. So  you see the five platforms  those are the boxes. within each one  a very discrete thing is happening. The area in between is sort of an urban continuum  these things that we can't predict their evolution to the same degree. To give you some sense of the power of this idea  the biggest block is what we call the book spiral. It's literally built in a very inexpensive way    it is a parking garage for books. It just so happens to be on the  th through   th floors of the building  but that is not necessarily an expensive approach. And it allows us to organize the entire Dewey Decimal System on one continuous run  no matter how it grows or contracts within the building  it will always have its clarity to end the sort of trail of tears that we've all experienced in public libraries. And so this was the final operation  which was to take these blocks as they were all pushed off kilter  and to hold onto them with a skin. That skin serves double duty  again  for economics. One  it is the lateral stability for the entire building  it's a structural element. But its dimensions were designed not only for structure  but also for holding on every piece of glass. The glass was then    I'll use the word impregnated    but it had a layer of metal that was called  stretched metal.  That metal acts as a microlouver  so from the exterior of the building  the sun sees it as totally opaque  but from the interior  it's entirely transparent. So now I'm going to take you on a tour of the building. Let me see if I can find it. For anyone who gets motion sickness  I apologize. So  this is the building. And I think what's important is  when we first unveiled the building  the public saw it as being totally about our whim and ego. And it was defended  believe it or not  by the librarians. They said   Look  we don't know what it is  but we know it's everything that we need it to be  based on the observations that we've done about the program.  This is going into one of the entries. So  it's an unusual building for a public library  obviously. So now we're going into what we call the living room. This is actually a program that we invented with the library. It was recognizing that public libraries are the last vestige of public free space. There are plenty of shopping malls that allow you to get out of the rain in downtown Seattle  but there are not so many free places that allow you to get out of the rain. So this was an unprogrammed area where people could pretty much do anything  including eat  yell  play chess and so forth. Now we're moving up into what we call the mixing chamber. That was the main technology area in the building. You'll have to tell me if I'm going too fast for you. And now up. This is actually the place that we put into the building so I could propose to my wife  right there. She said yes. I'm running out of time  so I'm actually going to stop. I can show this to you later. But let's see if I can very quickly get into the book spiral  because I think it's  as I said  the most    this is the main reading room    the most unique part of the building. You dizzy yet  Ok  so here  this is the book spiral. So  it's very indiscernible  but it's actually a continuous stair stepping. It allows you to  on one city block  go up one full floor  so that it's on a continuum. Ok  now I'm going to go back  and I'm going to hit a second project. I'm going to go very  very quickly through this. Now this is the Dallas Theater. It was an unusual client for us  because they came to us and they said   We need you to do a new building. We've been working in a temporary space for    years  but because of that temporary space  we've become an infamous theater company. Theater is really focused in New York  Chicago and Seattle  with the exception of the Dallas Theater Company.  And the very fact that they worked in a provisional space meant that for Beckett  they could blow out a wall  they could do  Cherry Orchard  and blow a hole through the floor  and so forth. So it was a very daunting task for us to do a brand new building that could be a pristine building  but keep this kind of experimental nature. And the second is  they were what we call a multi form theater  they do different kinds of performances in repertory. So they in the morning will do something in arena  then they'll do something in proscenium and so forth. And so they needed to be able to quickly transform between different theater organizations  and for operational budget reasons  this actually no longer happens in pretty much any multi form theater in the United States  so we needed to figure out a way to overcome that. So our thought was to literally put the theater on its head  to take those things that were previously defined as front of house and back of house and stack them above house and below house  and to create what we called a theater machine. We invest the money in the operation of the building. It's almost as though the building could be placed anywhere  wherever you place it  the area under it is charged for theatrical performances. And it allowed us to go back to first principles  and redefine fly tower  acoustic enclosure  light enclosure and so forth. And at the push of a button  it allows the artistic director to move between proscenium  thrust  and in fact  arena and traverse and flat floor  in a very quick transfiguration. So in fact  using operational budget  we can    sorry  capital cost    we can actually achieve what was no longer achievable in operational cost. And that means that the artistic director now has a palette that he or she can choose from  between a series of forms and a series of processions  because that enclosure around the theater that is normally trapped with front of house and back of house spaces has been liberated. So an artistic director has the ability to have a performance that enters in a Wagnerian procession  shows the first act in thrust  the intermission in a Greek procession  second act in arena  and so forth. So I'm going to show you what this actually means. This is the theater up close. Any portion around the theater actually can be opened discretely. The light enclosure can be lifted separate to the acoustic enclosure  so you can do Beckett with Dallas as the backdrop. Portions can be opened  so you can now actually have motorcycles drive directly into the performance  or you can even just have an open air performance  or for intermissions. The balconies all move to go between those configurations  but they also disappear. The proscenium line can also disappear. You can bring enormous objects in  so in fact  the Dallas Theater Company    their first show will be a play about Charles Lindbergh  and they'll want to bring in a real aircraft. And then it also provides them  in the off season  the ability to actually rent out their space for entirely different things. This is it from a distance. Open up entire portions for different kinds of events. And at night. Again  remove the light enclosure  keep the acoustic enclosure. This is a monster truck show. I'm going to show now the last project. This also is an unusual client. They inverted the whole idea of development. They came to us and they said    unlike normal developers    they said   We want to start out by providing a contemporary art museum in Louisville. That's our main goal.  And so instead of being a developer that sees an opportunity to make money  they saw an ability to be a catalyst in their downtown. And the fact that they wanted to support the contemporary art museum actually built their pro forma  so they worked in reverse. And that pro forma led us to a mixed use building that was very large  in order to support their aspirations of the art  but it also opened up opportunities for the art itself to collaborate  interact with commercial spaces that actually artists more and more want to work within. And it also charged us with thinking about how to have something that was both a single building and a credible sort of sub building. So this is Louisville's skyline  and I'm going to take you through the various constraints that led to the project. First  the physical constraints. We actually had to operate on three discrete sites  all of them well smaller than the size of the building. We had to operate next to the new Muhammad Ali Center  and respect it. We had to operate within the     year floodplain. Now  this area floods three to four times a year  and there's a levee behind our site  similar to the ones that broke in New Orleans. Had to operate behind the I    corridor  a street that cuts through the middle of these separate sites. So we're starting to build a sort of nightmare of constraints in a bathtub. Underneath the bathtub are the city's main power lines. And there is a pedestrian corridor that they wanted to add  that would link a series of cultural buildings  and a view corridor    because this is the historic district    that they didn't want to obstruct with a new building. And now we're going to add  .  million square feet. And if we did the traditional thing  that  .  million square feet    these are the different programs    the traditional thing would be to identify the public elements  place them on sites  and now we'd have a really terrible situation  a public thing in the middle of a bathtub that floods. And then we would size all the other elements    the different commercial elements  hotel  luxury housing  offices and so forth    and dump it on top. And we would create something that was unviable. In fact    and you know this    this is called the Time Warner Building. So our strategy was very simple. Just lift the entire block  flip some of the elements over  reposition them so they have appropriate views and relationships to downtown  and make circulation connections and reroute the road. So that's the basic concept  and now I'm going to show you what it leads to. Ok  it seems a very formal  willful gesture  but something derived entirely out of the constraints. And again  when we unveiled it  there was a sort of nervousness that this was about an architect making a statement  not an architect who was attempting to solve a series of problems. Now  within that center zone  as I said  we have the ability to mix a series of things. So here  this is sort of an x ray    the towers are totally developer driven. They told us the dimensions  the sizes and so forth  and we focused on taking all the public components    the lobbies  the bars    everything that different commercial elements would have  and combined it in the center  in the sort of subway map  in the transfer zone that would also include the contemporary art museum. So it creates a situation like this  where you have artists who can operate within an art space that also has an amazing view on the   nd floor  but it also has proximity that the curator can either open or close. It allows people on exercise bicycles to be seen  or to see the art  and so forth. It also means that if an artist wants to invade something like a swimming pool  they can begin to do their exhibition in a swimming pool  so they're not forced to always work within the confines of a contemporary gallery space. So  how to build this. It's very simple  it's a chair. So  we begin by building the cores. As we're building the cores  we build the contemporary art museum at grade. That allows us to have incredible efficiency and cost efficiency. This is not a high budget building. The moment the cores get to mid level  we finish the art museum  we put all the mechanical equipment in it  and then we jack it up into the air. This is how they build really large aircraft hangars  for instance  the ones that they did for the A   . Finish the cores  finish the meat and you get something that looks like this. Now I only have about    seconds  so I want to start an animation  and we'll conclude with that. Thank you. Chris asked me to add    the theater is under construction  and this project will start construction in about a year  and finish in     .  identify public elements   insert public elements at grade   optimize tower dimensions   place towers on site   lift program   flip    optimize program adjacencies   connect to context   redirect  th street  On September     the morning of my seventh birthday  I came downstairs to the kitchen  where my mother was washing the dishes and my father was reading the paper or something  and I sort of presented myself to them in the doorway  and they said   Hey  happy birthday   And I said   I'm seven.  And my father smiled and said   Well  you know what that means  don't you   And I said   Yeah  that I'm going to have a party and a cake and get a lot of presents   And my dad said   Well  yes. But more importantly  being seven means that you've reached the age of reason  and you're now capable of committing any and all sins against God and man.  Now  I had heard this phrase   age of reason   before. Sister Mary Kevin had been bandying it about my second grade class at school. But when she said it  the phrase seemed all caught up in the excitement of preparations for our first communion and our first confession  and everybody knew that was really all about the white dress and the white veil. And anyway  I hadn't really paid all that much attention to that phrase   age of reason.  So  I said   Yeah  yeah  age of reason. What does that mean again   And my dad said   Well  we believe  in the Catholic Church  that God knows that little kids don't know the difference between right and wrong  but when you're seven  you're old enough to know better. So  you've grown up and reached the age of reason  and now God will start keeping notes on you  and begin your permanent record.  And I said   Oh ... Wait a minute. You mean all that time  up till today  all that time I was so good  God didn't notice it   And my mom said   Well  I noticed it.  And I thought   How could I not have known this before  How could it not have sunk in when they'd been telling me  All that being good and no real credit for it. And worst of all  how could I not have realized this very important information until the very day that it was basically useless to me   So I said   Well  Mom and Dad  what about Santa Claus  I mean  Santa Claus knows if you're naughty or nice  right   And my dad said   Yeah  but  honey  I think that's technically just between Thanksgiving and Christmas.  And my mother said   Oh  Bob  stop it. Let's just tell her. I mean  she's seven. Julie  there is no Santa Claus.  Now  this was actually not that upsetting to me. My parents had this whole elaborate story about Santa Claus  how they had talked to Santa Claus himself and agreed that instead of Santa delivering our presents over the night of Christmas Eve  like he did for every other family who got to open their surprises first thing Christmas morning  our family would give Santa more time. Santa would come to our house while we were at nine o'clock high mass on Christmas morning  but only if all of us kids did not make a fuss. Which made me very suspicious. It was pretty obvious that it was really our parents giving us the presents. I mean  my dad had a very distinctive wrapping style  and my mother's handwriting was so close to Santa's. Plus  why would Santa save time by having to loop back to our house after he'd gone to everybody else's  There was only one obvious conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence  our family was too strange and weird for even Santa Claus to come visit  and my poor parents were trying to protect us from the embarrassment  this humiliation of rejection by Santa  who was jolly    but let's face it  he was also very judgmental. So to find out that there was no Santa Claus at all was actually sort of a relief. I left the kitchen not really in shock about Santa  but rather  I was just dumbfounded about how I could have missed this whole age of reason thing. It was too late for me  but maybe I could help someone else  someone who could use the information. They had to fit two criteria  they had to be old enough to be able to understand the whole concept of the age of reason  and not yet seven. The answer was clear  my brother Bill. He was six. Well  I finally found Bill about a block away from our house at this public school playground. It was a Saturday  and he was all by himself  just kicking a ball against the side of a wall. I ran up to him and said   Bill  I just realized that the age of reason starts when you turn seven  and then you're capable of committing any and all sins against God and man.  And Bill said   So   And I said   So  you're six. You have a whole year to do anything you want to and God won't notice it.  And he said   So   And I said   So  So everything   And I turned to run. I was so angry with him. But when I got to the top of the steps  I turned around dramatically and said   Oh  by the way  Bill    there is no Santa Claus.  Now  I didn't know it at the time  but I really wasn't turning seven on September   th. For my   th birthday  I planned a slumber party with all of my girlfriends  but a couple of weeks beforehand my mother took me aside and said   I need to speak to you privately. September   th is not your birthday. It's October   th.  And I said   What   And she said ...  Listen. The cut off date to start kindergarten was September   th.   So I told them that your birthday was September   th  and then I wasn't sure that you weren't just going to go blab it all over the place  so I started to tell you your birthday was September   th. But  Julie  you were so ready to start school  honey. You were so ready.  I thought about it  and when I was four  I was already the oldest of four children  and my mother even had another child to come  so what I think she    understandably    really meant was that she was so ready  she was so ready. Then she said   Don't worry  Julie. Every year on October   th  when it was your birthday but you didn't realize it  I made sure that you ate a piece of cake that day.  Which was comforting  but troubling. My mother had been celebrating my birthday with me  without me. What was so upsetting about this new piece of information was not that I had to change the date of my slumber party with all of my girlfriends. What was most upsetting was that this meant I was not a Virgo. I had a huge Virgo poster in my bedroom. And I read my horoscope every single day  and it was so totally me. And this meant that I was a Libra  So  I took the bus downtown to get the new Libra poster. The Virgo poster is a picture of a beautiful woman with long hair  sort of lounging by some water  but the Libra poster is just a huge scale. This was around the time that I started filling out physically  and I was filling out a lot more than a lot of the other girls  and frankly  the whole idea that my astrological sign was a scale just seemed ominous and depressing. But I got the new Libra poster  and I started to read my new Libra horoscope  and I was astonished to find that it was also totally me. It wasn't until years later  looking back on this whole age of reason  change of birthday thing  that it dawned on me  I wasn't turning seven when I thought I turned seven. I had a whole other month to do anything I wanted to before God started keeping tabs on me. Oh  life can be so cruel. One day  two Mormon missionaries came to my door. Now  I just live off a main thoroughfare in Los Angeles  and my block is    well  it's a natural beginning for people who are peddling things door to door. Sometimes I get little old ladies from the Seventh Day Adventist Church showing me these cartoon pictures of heaven. And sometimes I get teenagers who promise me that they won't join a gang and just start robbing people  if I only buy some magazine subscriptions from them. So normally  I just ignore the doorbell  but on this day  I answered. And there stood two boys  each about     in white  starched short sleeved shirts  and they had little name tags that identified them as official representatives of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints  and they said they had a message for me  from God. I said   A message for me  From God   And they said   Yes.  Now  I was raised in the Pacific Northwest  around a lot of Church of Latter day Saints people and  you know  I've worked with them and even dated them  but I never really knew the doctrine  or what they said to people when they were out on a mission  and I guess I was sort of curious  so I said   Well  please  come in.  And they looked really happy  because I don't think this happens to them all that often. And I sat them down  and I got them glasses of water    Ok  I got it  I got it. I got them glasses of water. Don't touch my hair  that's the thing. You can't put a video of myself in front of me and expect me not to fix my hair. Ok. So I sat them down and I got them glasses of water  and after niceties  they said   Do you believe that God loves you with all his heart   And I thought   Well  of course I believe in God  but you know  I don't like that word 'heart ' because it anthropomorphizes God  and I don't like the word  'his ' either  because that sexualizes God.  But I didn't want to argue semantics with these boys  so after a very long  uncomfortable pause  I said   Yes  yes  I do. I feel very loved.  And they looked at each other and smiled  like that was the right answer. And then they said   Do you believe that we're all brothers and sisters on this planet   And I said   Yes  I do.  And I was so relieved that it was a question I could answer so quickly. And they said   Well  then we have a story to tell you.  And they told me this story all about this guy named Lehi  who lived in Jerusalem in     BC. Now  apparently in Jerusalem in     BC  everyone was completely bad and evil. Every single one of them  man  woman  child  infant  fetus. And God came to Lehi and said to him   Put your family on a boat and I will lead you out of here.  And God did lead them. He led them to America. I said   America  From Jerusalem to America by boat in     BC   And they said   Yes.  Then they told me how Lehi and his descendants reproduced and reproduced  and over the course of     years  there were two great races of them  the Nephites and the Lamanites  and the Nephites were totally good    each and every one of them    and the Lamanites were totally bad and evil    every single one of them just bad to the bone. Then  after Jesus died on the cross for our sins  on his way up to heaven  he stopped by America and visited the Nephites. And he told them that if they all remained totally  totally good    each and every one of them    they would win the war against the evil Lamanites. But apparently somebody blew it  because the Lamanites were able to kill all the Nephites. All but one guy  this guy named Mormon  who managed to survive by hiding in the woods. And he made sure this whole story was written down in reformed Egyptian hieroglyphics chiseled onto gold plates  which he then buried near Palmyra  New York. Well  I was just on the edge of my seat. I said   What happened to the Lamanites   And they said   Well  they became our Native Americans  here in the U.S.  And I said   So  you believe the Native Americans are descended from a people who were totally evil   And they said   Yes.  Then they told me how this guy named Joseph Smith found those buried gold plates right in his backyard  and he also found this magic stone back there that he put into his hat and then buried his face into  and this allowed him to translate the gold plates from the reformed Egyptian into English. Well  at this point I just wanted to give these two boys some advice about their pitch. I wanted to say     Ok  don't start with this story.  I mean  even the Scientologists know to start with a personality test before they start    telling people all about Xenu  the evil intergalactic overlord. Then  they said   Do you believe that God speaks to us through his righteous prophets   And I said   No  I don't   because I was sort of upset about this Lamanite story and this crazy gold plate story  but the truth was  I hadn't really thought this through  so I backpedaled a little and I said   Well  what exactly do you mean by 'righteous'  And what do you mean by prophets  Like  could the prophets be women   And they said   No.  And I said   Why   And they said   Well  it's because God gave women a gift that is so spectacular  it is so wonderful  that the only gift he had left over to give men was the gift of prophecy.  What is this wonderful gift God gave women  I wondered  Maybe their greater ability to cooperate and adapt  Women's longer lifespan  The fact that women tend to be much less violent than men  But no    it wasn't any of these gifts. They said   Well  it's her ability to bear children.  I said   Oh  come on. I mean  even if women tried to have a baby every single year from the time they were    to the time they were     assuming they didn't die from exhaustion  it still seems like some women would have some time left over to hear the word of God.  And they said   No.  Well  then they didn't look so fresh faced and cute to me any more  but they had more to say. They said   Well  we also believe that if you're a Mormon  and if you're in good standing with the church  when you die  you get to go to heaven and be with your family for all eternity.  And I said   Oh  dear. That wouldn't be such a good incentive for me.  And they said   Oh. Hey  Well  we also believe that when you go to heaven  you get your body restored to you in its best original state. Like  if you'd lost a leg  well  you get it back. Or  if you'd gone blind  you could see.  I said   Oh. Now  I don't have a uterus  because I had cancer a few years ago. So does this mean that if I went to heaven  I would get my old uterus back   And they said   Sure.  And I said   I don't want it back. I'm happy without it.  Gosh. What if you had a nose job and you liked it  Would God force you to get your old nose back  Then they gave me this Book of Mormon  told me to read this chapter and that chapter  and said they'd come back and check in on me  and I think I said something like   Please don't hurry   or maybe just   Please don't   and they were gone. Ok  so I initially felt really superior to these boys  and smug in my more conventional faith. But then the more I thought about it  the more I had to be honest with myself. If someone came to my door and I was hearing Catholic theology and dogma for the very first time  and they said   We believe that God impregnated a very young girl without the use of intercourse  and the fact that she was a virgin is maniacally important to us.   And she had a baby  and that's the son of God   I mean  I would think that's equally ridiculous. I'm just so used to that story. So  I couldn't let myself feel condescending towards these boys. But the question they asked me when they first arrived really stuck in my head  Did I believe that God loved me with all his heart  Because I wasn't exactly sure how I felt about that question. Now  if they had asked me   Do you feel that God loves you with all his heart   Well  that would have been much different  I think I would have instantly answered   Yes  yes  I feel it all the time. I feel God's love when I'm hurt and confused  and I feel consoled and cared for. I take shelter in God's love when I don't understand why tragedy hits  and I feel God's love when I look with gratitude at all the beauty I see.  But since they asked me that question with the word  believe  in it  somehow it was all different  because I wasn't exactly sure if I believed what I so clearly felt. I'm often asked   What surprised you about the book   And I say   That I got to write it.  I would have never imagined that. Not in my wildest dreams did I think    I don't even consider myself to be an author. And I'm often asked   Why do you think so many people have read this  This thing's selling still about a million copies a month.  And I think it's because spiritual emptiness is a universal disease. I think inside at some point  we put our heads down on the pillow and we go   There's got to be more to life than this.  Get up in the morning  go to work  come home and watch TV  go to bed  get up in the morning  go to work  come home  watch TV  go to bed  go to parties on weekends. A lot of people say   I'm living.  No  you're not living    that's just existing. Just existing. I really think that there's this inner desire. I do believe what Chris said  I believe that you're not an accident. Your parents may not have planned you  but I believe God did. I think there are accidental parents  there's no doubt about that. I don't think there are accidental kids. And I think you matter. I think you matter to God  I think you matter to history  I think you matter to this universe. And I think that the difference between what I call the survival level of living  the success level of living  and the significance level of living is  Do you figure out   What on Earth am I here for   I meet a lot of people who are very smart  and say   But why can't I figure out my problems   And I meet a lot of people who are very successful  who say   Why don't I feel more fulfilled  Why do I feel like a fake  Why do I feel like I've got to pretend that I'm more than I really am   I think that comes down to this issue of meaning  of significance  of purpose. I think it comes down to this issue of   Why am I here  What am I here for  Where am I going   These are not religious issues. They're human issues. I wanted to tell Michael before he spoke that I really appreciate what he does  because it makes my life work a whole lot easier. As a pastor  I do see a lot of kooks. And I have learned that there are kooks in every area of life. Religion doesn't have a monopoly on that  but there are plenty of religious kooks. There are secular kooks  there are smart kooks  dumb kooks. There are people    a lady came up to me the other day  and she had a white piece of paper    Michael  you'll like this one    and she said   What do you see in it   And I looked at it and I said   Oh  I don't see anything.  And she goes   Well  I see Jesus   and started crying and left. I'm going   OK   you know   Fine.  Good for you. When the book became the best selling book in the world for the last three years  I kind of had my little crisis. And that was  What is the purpose of this  Because it brought in enormous amounts of money. When you write the best selling book in the world  it's tons and tons of money. And it brought in a lot of attention  neither of which I wanted. When I started Saddleback Church  I was    years old. I started it with one other family in     . And I decided that I was never going to go on TV  because I didn't want to be a celebrity. I didn't want to be a  quote   evangelist  televangelist     that's not my thing. And all of the sudden  it brought a lot of money and a lot of attention. I don't think    now  this is a worldview  and I will tell you  everybody's got a worldview. Everybody's betting their life on something. You're betting your life on something  you just better know why you're betting what you're betting on. So  everybody's betting their life on something. And when I  you know  made a bet  I happened to believe that Jesus was who he said he was. And I believe in a pluralistic society  everybody's betting on something. And when I started the church  you know  I had no plans to do what it's doing now. And then when I wrote this book  and all of a sudden  it just took off  and I started saying  now  what's the purpose of this  Because as I started to say  I don't think you're given money or fame for your own ego  ever. I just don't believe that. And when you write a book that the first sentence of the book is   It's not about you   then  when all of a sudden it becomes the best selling book in history  you've got to figure  well  I guess it's not about me. That's kind of a no brainer. So  what is it for  And I began to think about what I call the  stewardship of affluence  and the  stewardship of influence.  So I believe  essentially  leadership is stewardship. That if you are a leader in any area    in business  in politics  in sports  in art  in academics  in any area    you don't own it. You are a steward of it. For instance  that's why I believe in protecting the environment. This is not my planet. It wasn't mine before I was born  it's not going to be mine after I die  I'm just here for    years and then that's it. I was debating the other day on a talk show  and the guy was challenging me and he'd go   What's a pastor doing on protecting the environment   And I asked this guy  I said   Well  do you believe that human beings are responsible to make the world a little bit better place for the next generation  Do you think we have a stewardship here  to take the environment seriously   And he said   No.  I said   Oh  you don't   I said   Let me make this clear again  Do you believe that as human beings    I'm not talking about religion    do you believe that as human beings  it is our responsibility to take care of this planet  and make it just a little bit better for the next generation   And he said   No. Not any more than any other species.  When he said the word  species   he was revealing his worldview. And he was saying   I'm no more responsible to take care of this environment than a duck is.  Well now  I know a lot of times we act like ducks  but you're not a duck. You're not a duck. And you are responsible    that's my worldview. And so  you need to understand what your worldview is. The problem is most people never really think it through. They never really ... codify it or qualify it or quantify it  and say   This is what I believe in. This is why I believe what I believe.  I don't personally have enough faith to be an atheist. But you may  you may. Your worldview  though  does determine everything else in your life  because it determines your decisions  it determines your relationships  it determines your level of confidence. It determines  really  everything in your life. What we believe  obviously    and you know this    determines our behavior  and our behavior determines what we become in life. So all of this money started pouring in  and all of this fame started pouring in. And I'm going  what do I do with this  My wife and I first made five decisions on what to do with the money. We said   First  we're not going to use it on ourselves.  I didn't go out and buy a bigger house. I don't own a guesthouse. I still drive the same four year old Ford that I've driven. We just said  we're not going to use it on us. The second thing was  I stopped taking a salary from the church that I pastor. Third thing is  I added up all that the church had paid me over the last    years  and I gave it back. And I gave it back because I didn't want anybody thinking that I do what I do for money    I don't. In fact  personally  I've never met a priest or a pastor or a minister who does it for money. I know that's the stereotype  I've never met one of them. Believe me  there's a whole lot easier ways to make money. Pastors are like on    hours a day call  they're like doctors. I left late today    I'd hoped to be here yesterday    because my father in law is in his last  probably     hours before he dies of cancer. And I'm watching a guy who's lived his life    he's now in his mid   s    and he's dying with peace. You know  the test of your worldview is not how you act in the good times. The test of your worldview is how you act at the funeral. And having been through literally hundreds if not thousands of funerals  it makes a difference. It makes a difference what you believe. So  we gave it all back  and then we set up three foundations  working on some of the major problems of the world  illiteracy  poverty  pandemic diseases    particularly HIV AIDS    and set up these three foundations  and put the money into that. The last thing we did is we became what I call  reverse tithers.  And that is  when my wife and I got married    years ago  we started tithing. Now  that's a principle in the Bible that says give    percent of what you get back to charity  give it away to help other people. So  we started doing that  and each year we would raise our tithe one percent. So  our first year of marriage we went to    percent  second year we went to    percent  and the third year we went to    percent  and on and on and on. Why did I do that  Because every time I give  it breaks the grip of materialism in my life. Materialism is all about getting    get  get  get  get all you can  can all you get  sit on the can and spoil the rest. It's all about more  having more. And we think that the good life is actually looking good    that's most important of all    looking good  feeling good and having the goods. But that's not the good life. I meet people all the time who have those  and they're not necessarily happy. If money actually made you happy  then the wealthiest people in the world would be the happiest. And that I know  personally  I know  is not true. It's just not true. So  the good life is not about looking good  feeling good or having the goods  it's about being good and doing good. Giving your life away. Significance in life doesn't come from status  because you can always find somebody who's got more than you. It doesn't come from sex. It doesn't come from salary. It comes from serving. It is in giving our lives away that we find meaning  we find significance. That's the way we were wired  I believe  by God. And so we began to give away  and now after    years  my wife and I are reverse tithers    we give away    percent and live on   . That  actually  was the easy part. The hard part is  what do I do with all this attention  Because I started getting all kinds of invitations. I just came off a nearly month long speaking tour on three different continents  and I won't go into that  but it was an amazing thing. And I'm going  what do I do with this notoriety that the book has brought  And  being a pastor  I started reading the Bible. There's a chapter in the Bible called Psalm     and it's Solomon's prayer for more influence. When you read this prayer  it sounds incredibly selfish  self centered. He says   God  I want you to make me famous.  That's what he prays. He said   I want you to make me famous. I want you to spread the fame of my name through every land  I want you to give me power. I want you to make me famous  I want you to give me influence.  And it just sounds like the most egotistical request you could make  if you were going to pray. Until you read the whole psalm  the whole chapter. And then he says   So that the king ...     he was the king of Israel at that time  at its apex in power     ... so that the king may care for the widow and orphan  support the oppressed  defend the defenseless  care for the sick  assist the poor  speak up for the foreigner  those in prison.  Basically  he's talking about all the marginalized in society. And as I read that  I looked at it  and I thought  you know  what this is saying is that the purpose of influence is to speak up for those who have no influence. The purpose of influence is not to build your ego. Or your net worth. And  by the way  your net worth is not the same thing as your self worth. Your value is not based on your valuables. It's based on a whole different set of things. And so the purpose of influence is to speak up for those who have no influence. And I had to admit  I can't think of the last time I thought of widows and orphans. They're not on my radar. I pastor a church in one of the most affluent areas of America    a bunch of gated communities. I have a church full of CEOs and scientists. And I could go five years and never  ever see a homeless person. They're just not in my pathway. Now  they're    miles up the road in Santa Ana. So I had to say  ok  I would use whatever affluence and whatever influence I've got to help those who don't have either of those. You know  there's a story in the Bible about Moses  whether you believe it's true or not  it really doesn't matter to me. But Moses  if you saw the movie   The Ten Commandments   Moses goes out  and there's this burning bush  and God talks to him  and God says   Moses  what's in your hand   I think that's one of the most important questions you'll ever be asked  What's in your hand  Moses says   It's a staff. It's a shepherd's staff.  And God says   Throw it down.  And if you saw the movie  you know  he throws it down and it becomes a snake. And then God says   Pick it up.  And he picks it back up again  and it becomes a staff again. Now  I'm reading this thing  and I'm going  what is that all about  OK. What's that all about  Well  I do know a couple of things. Number one  God never does a miracle to show off. It's not just   Wow  isn't that cool   And  by the way  my God doesn't have to show up on cheese bread. You know  if God's going to show up  he's not going to show up on cheese bread. Ok  I just  this is why I love what Michael does  because it's like  if he's debunking it  then I don't have to. But God    my God    doesn't show up on sprinkler images. He's got a few more powerful ways than that to do whatever he wants to do. But he doesn't do miracles just to show off. Second thing is  if God ever asks you a question  he already knows the answer. Obviously  if he's God  then that would mean that when he asks the question  it's for your benefit  not his. So he's going   What's in your hand   Now  what was in Moses' hand  Well  it was a shepherd's staff. Now  follow me on this. This staff represented three things about Moses' life. First  it represented his identity  he was a shepherd. It's the symbol of his own occupation  I am a shepherd. It's a symbol of his identity  his career  his job. Second  it's a symbol of not only his identity  it's a symbol of his income  because all of his assets are tied up in sheep. In those days  nobody had bank accounts  or American Express cards  or hedge funds. Your assets are tied up in your flocks. So it's a symbol of his identity  and it's a symbol of his income. And the third thing  it's a symbol of his influence. What do you do with a shepherd's staff  Well  you know  you move sheep from point A to point B with it  by hook or by crook. You pull them or you poke them. One or the other. So  he's saying   You're going to lay down your identity. What's in your hand  You've got identity  you've got income  you've got influence. What's in your hand   And he's saying   If you lay it down  I'll make it come alive. I'll do some things you could never imagine possible.  And if you've watched that movie   Ten Commandments   all of those big miracles that happen in Egypt are done through this staff. Last year  I was invited to speak at the NBA All Stars game. And so  I'm talking to the players  because most of the NBA teams  NFL teams and all the other teams have done this    Days of Purpose  based on the book. And I asked them  I said   What's in your hand  So  what's in your hand   I said   It's a basketball. And that basketball represents your identity  who you are  you're an NBA player. It represents your income  you're making a lot of money off that little ball. And it represents your influence. And even though you're only going to be in the NBA for a few years  you're going to be an NBA player for the rest of your life. And that gives you enormous influence. So  what are you going to do with what you've been given   And I guess that's the main reason I came up here today  to all of you very bright people at TED    it is to say   What's in your hand   What do you have that you've been given  Talent  background  education  freedom  networks  opportunities  wealth  ideas  creativity. What are you doing with what you've been given  That  to me  is the primary question about life. That  to me  is what being purpose driven is all about. In the book  I talk about how you're wired to do certain things  you're  SHAPED  with    a little acrostic  Spiritual gifts  Heart  Ability  Personality and Experiences. These things shape you. And if you want to know what you ought to be doing with your life  you need to look at your shape     What am I wired to do   Why would God wire you to do something and then not have you do it  If you're wired to be an anthropologist  you'll be an anthropologist. If you're wired to be an undersea explorer  you'll be an undersea explorer. If you're wired to make deals  you make deals. If you're wired to paint  you paint. Did you know that God smiles when you be you  When my little kids    when my kids were little    they're all grown now  I have grandkids    I used to go in and sit on the side of their bed  and I used to watch my kids sleep. And I just watched their little bodies rise and lower  rise and lower. And I would look at them   This is not an accident.  Rise and lower. And I got joy out of just watching them sleep. Some people have the misguided idea that God only gets excited when you're doing  quote   spiritual things   like going to church or helping the poor  or  you know  confessing or doing something like that. The bottom line is  God gets pleasure watching you be you. Why  He made you. And when you do what you were made to do  he goes   That's my boy  That's my girl  You're using the talent and ability that I gave you.  So my advice to you is  look at what's in your hand    your identity  your influence  your income    and say   It's not about me. It's about making the world a better place.  Thank you. It's wonderful to be back. I love this wonderful gathering. And you must be wondering   What on earth  Have they put up the wrong slide   No  no. Look at this magnificent beast  and ask the question  Who designed it  This is TED  this is Technology  Entertainment  Design  and there's a dairy cow. It's a quite wonderfully designed animal. And I was thinking  how do I introduce this  And I thought  well  maybe that old doggerel by Joyce Kilmer  you know   Poems are made by fools like me  but only God can make a tree.  And you might say   Well  God designed the cow.  But  of course  God got a lot of help. This is the ancestor of cattle. This is the aurochs. And it was designed by natural selection  the process of natural selection  over many millions of years. And then it became domesticated  thousands of years ago. And human beings became its stewards  and  without even knowing what they were doing  they gradually redesigned it and redesigned it and redesigned it. And then more recently  they really began to do reverse engineering on this beast and figure out just what the parts were  how they worked and how they might be optimized    how they might be made better. Now  why am I talking about cows  Because I want to say that much the same thing is true of religions. Religions are natural phenomena    they're just as natural as cows. They have evolved over millennia. They have a biological base  just like the aurochs. They have become domesticated  and human beings have been redesigning their religions for thousands of years. This is TED  and I want to talk about design. Because what I've been doing for the last four years    really since the first time you saw me    some of you saw me at TED when I was talking about religion    and in the last four years  I've been working just about non stop on this topic. And you might say it's about the reverse engineering of religions. Now that very idea  I think  strikes terror in many people  or anger  or anxiety of one sort or another. And that is the spell that I want to break. I want to say  no  religions are an important natural phenomenon. We should study them with the same intensity that we study all the other important natural phenomena  like global warming  as we heard so eloquently last night from Al Gore. Today's religions are brilliantly designed    brilliantly designed. They are immensely powerful social institutions and many of their features can be traced back to earlier features that we can really make sense of by reverse engineering. And  as with the cow  there's a mixture of evolutionary design    designed by natural selection itself    and intelligent design    more or less intelligent design    and redesigned by human beings who are trying to redesign their religions. You don't do book talks at TED  but I'm going to have just one slide about my book  because there is one message in it which I think this group really needs to hear. And I would be very interested to get your responses to this. It's the one policy proposal that I make in the book  at this time  when I claim not to know enough about religion to know what other policy proposals to make. And it's one that echoes remarks that you've heard already today. Here's my proposal  I'm going to just take a couple of minutes to explain it  Education on world religions for all of our children    in primary school  in high school  in public schools  in private schools and in home schooling. So what I'm proposing is  just as we require reading  writing  arithmetic  American history  so we should have a curriculum on facts about all the religions of the world    about their history  about their creeds  about their texts  their music  their symbolisms  their prohibitions  their requirements. And this should be presented factually  straightforwardly  with no particular spin  to all of the children in the country. And as long as you teach them that  you can teach them anything else you like. That  I think  is maximal tolerance for religious freedom. As long as you inform your children about other religions  then you may    and as early as you like and whatever you like    teach them whatever creed you want them to learn. But also let them know about other religions. Now  why do I say that  Because democracy depends on an informed citizenship. Informed consent is the very bedrock of our understanding of democracy. Misinformed consent is not worth it. It's like a coin flip  it doesn't count  really. Democracy depends on informed consent. This is the way we treat people as responsible adults. Now  children below the age of consent are a special case. Parents    I'm going to use a word that Pastor Rick just used    parents are stewards of their children. They don't own them. You can't own your children. You have a responsibility to the world  to the state  to them  to take care of them right. You may teach them whatever creed you think is most important  but I say you have a responsibility to let them be informed about all the other creeds in the world  too. The reason I've taken this time is I've been fascinated to hear some of the reactions to this. One reviewer for a Roman Catholic newspaper called it  totalitarian.  It strikes me as practically libertarian. Is it totalitarian to require reading  writing and arithmetic  I don't think so. All I'm saying is    and facts  facts only  no values  just facts    about all the world's religions. Another reviewer called it  hilarious.  Well  I'm really bothered by the fact that anybody would think that was hilarious. It seems to me to be such a plausible  natural extension of the democratic principles we already have that I'm shocked to think anybody would find that just ridiculous. I know many religions are so anxious about preserving the purity of their faith among their children that they are intent on keeping their children ignorant of other faiths. I don't think that's defensible. But I'd really be pleased to get your answers on that    any reactions to that    later. But now I'm going to move on. Back to the cow. This picture  which I pulled off the web    the fellow on the left is really an important part of this picture. That's the steward. Cows couldn't live without human stewards    they're domesticated. They're a sort of ectosymbiont. They depend on us for their survival. And Pastor Rick was just talking about sheep. I'm going to talk about sheep  too. There's a lot of serendipitous convergence here. How clever it was of sheep to acquire shepherds  Think of what this got them. They could outsource all their problems  protection from predators  food finding ... ... health maintenance. The only cost in most flocks    not even this    a loss of free mating. What a deal   How clever of sheep   you might say. Except  of course  it wasn't the sheep's cleverness. We all know sheep are not exactly rocket scientists    they're not very smart. It wasn't the cleverness of the sheep at all. They were clueless. But it was a very clever move. Whose clever move was it  It was the clever move of natural selection itself. Francis Crick  the co discoverer of the structure of DNA with Jim Watson  once joked about what he called Orgel's Second Rule. Leslie Orgel is a molecular biologist  brilliant guy  and Orgel's Second Rule is  Evolution is cleverer than you are. Now  that is not Intelligent Design    not from Francis Crick. Evolution is cleverer than you are. If you understand Orgel's Second Rule  then you understand why the Intelligent Design movement is basically a hoax. The designs discovered by the process of natural selection are brilliant  unbelievably brilliant. Again and again biologists are fascinated with the brilliance of what's discovered. But the process itself is without purpose  without foresight  without design. When I was here four years ago  I told the story about an ant climbing a blade of grass. And why the ant was doing it was because its brain had been infected with a lancet fluke that was needed to get into the belly of a sheep or a cow in order to reproduce. So it was sort of a spooky story. And I think some people may have misunderstood. Lancet flukes aren't smart. I submit that the intelligence of a lancet fluke is down there  somewhere between petunia and carrot. They're not really bright. They don't have to be. The lesson we learn from this is  you don't have to have a mind to be a beneficiary. The design is there in nature  but it's not in anybody's head. It doesn't have to be. That's the way evolution works. Question  Was domestication good for sheep  It was great for their genetic fitness. And here I want to remind you of a wonderful point that Paul MacCready made at TED three years ago. Here's what he said   Ten thousand years ago  at the dawn of agriculture  human population  plus livestock and pets  was approximately a tenth of one percent of the terrestrial vertebrate landmass.  That was just        years ago. Yesterday  in biological terms. What is it today  Does anybody remember what he told us     percent. That is what we have done on this planet. Now  I talked to Paul afterwards    I wanted to check to find out how he'd calculated this  and get the sources and so forth    and he also gave me a paper that he had written on this. And there was a passage in it which he did not present here and I think it is so good  I'm going to read it to you   Over billions of years on a unique sphere  chance has painted a thin covering of life  complex  improbable  wonderful and fragile. Suddenly  we humans    a recently arrived species no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature    have grown in population  technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power. We now wield the paintbrush.  We heard about the atmosphere as a thin layer of varnish. Life itself is just a thin coat of paint on this planet. And we're the ones that hold the paintbrush. And how can we do that  The key to our domination of the planet is culture. And the key to culture is religion. Suppose Martian scientists came to Earth. They would be puzzled by many things. Anybody know what this is  I'll tell you what it is. This is a million people gathering on the banks of the Ganges in       perhaps the largest single gathering of human beings ever  as seen from satellite photograph. Here's a big crowd. Here's another crowd in Mecca. Martians would be amazed by this. They'd want to know how it originated  what it was for and how it perpetuates itself. Actually  I'm going to pass over this. The ant isn't alone. There's all sorts of wonderful cases of species which    in that case    A parasite gets into a mouse and needs to get into the belly of a cat. And it turns the mouse into Mighty Mouse  makes it fearless  so it runs out in the open  where it'll be eaten by a cat. True story. In other words  we have these hijackers    you've seen this slide before  from four years ago    a parasite that infects the brain and induces even suicidal behavior  on behalf of a cause other than one's own genetic fitness. Does that ever happen to us  Yes  it does    quite wonderfully. The Arabic word  Islam  means  submission.  It means  surrender of self interest to the will of Allah.  But I'm not just talking about Islam. I'm talking also about Christianity. This is a parchment music page that I found in a Paris bookstall    years ago. And on it  it says  in Latin   Semen est verbum Dei. Sator autem Christus.  The word of God is the seed and the sower of the seed is Christ. Same idea. Well  not quite. But in fact  Christians  too ... glory in the fact that they have surrendered to God. I'll give you a few quotes.  The heart of worship is surrender. Surrendered people obey God's words  even if it doesn't make sense.  Those words are by Rick Warren. Those are from  The Purpose Driven Life.  And I want to turn now  briefly  to talk about that book  which I've read. You've all got a copy  and you've just heard the man. And what I want to do now is say a bit about this book from the design standpoint  because I think it's actually a brilliant book. First of all  the goal    and you heard just now what the goal is    it's to bring purpose to the lives of millions  and he has succeeded. Is it a good goal  In itself  I'm sure we all agree  it is a wonderful goal. He's absolutely right. There are lots of people out there who don't have purpose in their life  and bringing purpose to their life is a wonderful goal. I give him an A  on this. Is the goal achieved  Yes. Thirty million copies of this book. Al Gore  eat your heart out. Just exactly what Al is trying to do  Rick is doing. This is a fantastic achievement. And the means    how does he do it  It's a brilliant redesign of traditional religious themes    updating them  quietly dropping obsolete features  putting new interpretations on other features. This is the evolution of religion that's been going on for thousands of years  and he's just the latest brilliant practitioner of it. I don't have to tell you this  you just heard the man. Excellent insights into human psychology  wise advice on every page. Moreover  he invites us to look under the hood. I really appreciated that. For instance  he has an appendix where he explains his choice of translations of different Bible verses. The book is clear  vivid  accessible  beautifully formatted. Just enough repetition. That's really important. Every time you read it or say it  you make another copy in your brain. Every time you read it or say it  you make another copy in your brain. With me  everybody    you make another copy in your brain. Thank you. And now we come to my problem. Because I'm absolutely sincere in my appreciation of all that I said about this book. But I wish it were better. I have some problems with the book. And it would just be insincere of me not to address those problems. I wish he could do this with a revision  a Mark   version of his book.  The truth will set you free.  That's what it says in the Bible  and it's something that I want to live by  too. My problem is  some of the bits in it I don't think are true. Now some of this is a difference of opinion. And that's not my main complaint  that's worth mentioning. Here's a passage    it's very much what he said  anyway   If there was no God we would all be accidents  the result of astronomical random chance in the Universe. You could stop reading this book because life would have no purpose or meaning or significance. There would be no right or wrong and no hope beyond your brief years on Earth.  Now  I just do not believe that. By the way  I find    Homer Groening's film presented a beautiful alternative to that very claim. Yes  there is meaning and a reason for right or wrong. We don't need a belief in God to be good or to have meaning in us. But that  as I said  is just a difference of opinion. That's not what I'm really worried about. How about this   God designed this planet's environment just so we could live in it.  I'm afraid that a lot of people take that sentiment to mean that we don't have to do the sorts of things that Al Gore is trying so hard to get us to do. I am not happy with that sentiment at all. And then I find this   All the evidence available in the biological sciences supports the core proposition that the cosmos is a specially designed whole with life and mankind as its fundamental goal and purpose  a whole in which all facets of reality have their meaning and explanation in this central fact.  Well  that's Michael Denton. He's a creationist. And here  I think   Wait a minute.  I read this again. I read it three or four times and I think   Is he really endorsing Intelligent Design  Is he endorsing creationism here   And you can't tell. So I'm sort of thinking   Well  I don't know  I don't know if I want to get upset with this yet.  But then I read on  and I read this   First  Noah had never seen rain  because prior to the Flood  God irrigated the earth from the ground up.  I wish that sentence weren't in there  because I think it is false. And I think that thinking this way about the history of the planet  after we've just been hearing about the history of the planet over millions of years  discourages people from scientific understanding. Now  Rick Warren uses scientific terms and scientific factoids and information in a very interesting way. Here's one   God deliberately shaped and formed you to serve him in a way that makes your ministry unique. He carefully mixed the DNA cocktail that created you.  I think that's false. Now  maybe we want to treat it as metaphorical. Here's another one   For instance  your brain can store     trillion facts. Your mind can handle        decisions a second.  Well  it would be interesting to find the interpretation where I would accept that. There might be some way of treating that as true.  Anthropologists have noted that worship is a universal urge  hardwired by God into the very fiber of our being    an inbuilt need to connect with God.  Well  the sense of which I agree with him  except I think it has an evolutionary explanation. And what I find deeply troubling in this book is that he seems to be arguing that if you want to be moral  if you want to have meaning in your life  you have to be an Intelligent Designer  you have to deny the theory of evolution by natural selection. And I think  on the contrary  that it is very important to solving the world's problems that we take evolutionary biology seriously. Whose truth are we going to listen to  Well  this is from  The Purpose Driven Life    The Bible must become the authoritative standard for my life  the compass I rely on for direction  the counsel I listen to for making wise decisions  and the benchmark I use for evaluating everything.  Well maybe  OK  but what's going to follow from this  And here's one that does concern me. Remember I quoted him before with this line   Surrendered people obey God's word  even if it doesn't make sense.  And that's a problem.  Don't ever argue with the Devil. He's better at arguing than you are  having had thousands of years to practice.  Now  Rick Warren didn't invent this clever move. It's an old move. It's a very clever adaptation of religions. It's a wild card for disarming any reasonable criticism.  You don't like my interpretation  You've got a reasonable objection to it  Don't listen  don't listen  That's the Devil speaking.  This discourages the sort of reasoning citizenship it seems to me that we want to have. I've got one more problem  then I'm through. And I'd really like to get a response if Rick is able to do it.  In the Great Commission  Jesus said  'Go to all people of all nations and make them my disciples. Baptize them in the name of the Father  the Son and the Holy Spirit  and teach them to do everything I've told you.'  The Bible says Jesus is the only one who can save the world. We've seen many wonderful maps of the world in the last day or so. Here's one  not as beautiful as the others  it simply shows the religions of the world. Here's one that shows the sort of current breakdown of the different religions. Do we really want to commit ourselves to engulfing all the other religions  when their holy books are telling them   Don't listen to the other side  that's just Satan talking    It seems to me that that's a very problematic ship to get on for the future. I found this sign as I was driving to Maine recently  in front of a church   Good without God becomes zero.  Sort of cute. A very clever little meme. I don't believe it and I think this idea  popular as it is    not in this guise  but in general    is itself one of the main problems that we face. If you are like me  you know many wonderful  committed  engaged atheists  agnostics  who are being very good without God. And you also know many religious people who hide behind their sanctity instead of doing good works. So  I wish we could drop this meme. I wish this meme would go extinct. Thanks very much for your attention. I've been at MIT for    years. I went to TED I. There's only one other person here  I think  who did that. All the other TEDs    and I went to them all  under Ricky's regime    I talked about what the Media Lab was doing  which today has almost     people in it. And if you read the press  last week it actually said I quit the Media Lab. I didn't quit the Media Lab  I stepped down as chairman    which was a kind of ridiculous title  but someone else has taken it on    and one of the things you can do as a professor is you stay on as a professor. And I will now do for the rest of my life the One Laptop Per Child  which I've sort of been doing for a year and a half  anyway. So I'm going to tell you about this  use my    minutes to tell you why we're doing it  how we're doing it and then what we're doing. And at some point I'll even pass around what the      laptop might be like. I was asked by Chris to talk about some of the big issues  and so I figured I'd start with the three that at least drove me to do this. And the first is pretty obvious. It's amazing when you meet a head of state  and you say   What is your most precious natural resource   They will not say  children  at first  and then when you say   children   they will pretty quickly agree with you. And so that isn't very hard. Everybody agrees that whatever the solutions are to the big problems  they include education  sometimes can be just education and can never be without some element of education. So that's certainly part of it. And the third is a little bit less obvious. And that is that we all in this room learned how to walk  how to talk  not by being taught how to talk  or taught how to walk  but by interacting with the world  by having certain results as a consequence of being able to ask for something  or being able to stand up and reach it. Whereas at about the age six  we were told to stop learning that way  and that all learning from then on would happen through teaching  whether it's people standing up  like I'm doing now  or a book  or something. But it was really through teaching. And one of the things in general that computers have provided to learning is that it now includes a kind of learning which is a little bit more like walking and talking  in the sense that a lot of it is driven by the learner himself or herself. So with those as the principles    some of you may know Seymour Papert. This is back in       when we were working in Senegal. Because some people think that the      laptop just happened a year ago  or two years ago  or we were struck by lightning    this actually has gone back a long time  and in fact  back to the '  s. Here we're in the '  s. Steve Jobs had given us some laptops. We were in Senegal. It didn't scale but it at least was bringing computers to developing countries and learning pretty quickly that these kids  even though English wasn't their language  the Latin alphabet barely was their language  but they could just swim like fish. They could play these like pianos. A little bit more recently  I got involved personally. And these are two anecdotes    one was in Cambodia  in a village that has no electricity  no water  no television  no telephone  but has broadband Internet now. And these kids  their first English word is  Google  and they only know Skype. They've never heard of telephony. They just use Skype. And they go home at night    they've got a broadband connection in a hut that doesn't have electricity. The parents love it  because when they open up the laptops  it's the brightest light source in the house. And talk about where metaphors and reality mix    this is the actual school. In parallel with this  Seymour Papert got the governor of Maine to legislate one laptop per child in the year     . Now at the time  I think it's fair to say that    percent of the teachers were    let me say  apprehensive. Really  they were actually against it. And they really preferred that the money would be used for higher salaries  more schools  whatever. And now  three and a half years later  guess what  They're reporting five things  drop of truancy to almost zero  attending parent teacher meetings    which nobody did and now almost everybody does    drop in discipline problems  increase in student participation. Teachers are now saying it's kind of fun to teach. Kids are engaged    they have laptops     and then the fifth  which interests me the most  is that the servers have to be turned off at certain times at night because the teachers are getting too much email from the kids asking them for help. So when you see that kind of thing    this is not something that you have to test. The days of pilot projects are over  when people say   We'd like to do three or four thousand in our country to see how it works.  Screw you. Go to the back of the line and someone else will do it  and then when you figure out that this works  you can join as well. And this is what we're doing. So  One Laptop Per Child was formed about a year and a half ago. It's a nonprofit association. It raised about    million dollars to do the engineering to just get this built  and then have it produced afterwards. Scale is truly important. And it's not important because you can buy components at a lower price  OK  It's because you can go to a manufacturer    and I will leave the name out    but we wanted a small display  doesn't have to have perfect color uniformity. It can even have a pixel or two missing. It doesn't have to be that bright. And this particular manufacturer said   We're not interested in that. We're interested in the living room. We're interested in perfect color uniformity. We're interested in big displays  bright displays. You're not part of our strategic plan.  And I said   That's kind of too bad  because we need     million units a year.  And they said   Oh  well  maybe we could become part of your strategic plan.  And that's why scale counts. And that's why we will not launch this without five to    million units in the first run. And the idea is to launch with enough scale that the scale itself helps bring the price down  and that's why I said seven to    million there. And we're doing it without a sales and marketing team. I mean  you're looking at the sales and marketing team. We will do it by going to seven large countries and getting them to agree and launch it  and then the others can follow. We have partners. It's not hard to guess Google would be one. The others are all playing to pending. And this has been in the press a great deal. It's the so called Green Machine that we introduced with Kofi Annan in November at the World Summit that was held in Tunisia. Now once people start looking at this  they say   Ah  this is a laptop project.  Well  no  it's not a laptop project. It's an education project. And the fun part    and I'm quite focused on it    I tell people I used to be a light bulb  but now I'm a laser    I'm just going to get that thing built  and it turns out it's not so hard. Because laptop economics are the following  I say    percent here    it's more like        percent of the cost of your laptop is sales  marketing  distribution and profit. Now we have none of those  OK  None of those figure into our cost  because first of all  we sell it at cost  and the governments distribute it. It gets distributed to the school system like a textbook. So that piece disappears. Then you have display and everything else. Now the display on your laptop costs  in rough numbers     dollars a diagonal inch. That can drop to eight  it can drop to seven but it's not going to drop to two  or to one and a half  unless we do some pretty clever things. It's the rest    that little brown box    that is pretty fascinating  because the rest of your laptop is devoted to itself. It's a little bit like an obese person having to use most of their energy to move their obesity. And we have a situation today which is incredible. I've been using laptops since their inception. And my laptop runs slower  less reliably and less pleasantly than it ever has before. And this year is worse. People clap  sometimes you even get standing ovations  and I say   What the hell's wrong with you  Why are we all sitting there   And somebody    to remain nameless    called our laptop a  gadget  recently. And I said   God  our laptop's going to go like a bat out of hell. When you open it up  it's going to go 'bing.'  It'll be on. It'll be just like it was in       when you bought an Apple Macintosh    . It worked really well. And we've been going steadily downhill. Now  people ask all the time what it is. That's what it is. The two pieces that are probably notable  it'll be a mesh network  so when the kids open up their laptops  they all become a network  and then just need one or two points of backhaul. You can serve a couple of thousand kids with two megabits. So you really can bring into a village  and then the villages can connect themselves  and you really can do it quite well. The dual mode display    the idea is to have a display that both works outdoors    isn't it fun using your cell phone outdoors in the sunlight  Well  you can't see it. And one of the reasons you can't see it is because it's backlighting most of the time  most cell phones. Now  what we're doing is  we're doing one that will be both frontlit and backlit. And whether you manually switch it or you do it in the software is to be seen. But when it's backlit  it's color. And when it's frontlit  it's black and white at three times the resolution. Is it all worked out  No. That's why a lot of our people are more or less living in Taiwan right now. And in about    days  we'll know for sure whether this works. Probably the most important piece there is that the kids really can do the maintenance. And this is again something that people don't believe  but I really think it's quite true. That's the machine we showed in Tunis. This is more the direction that we're going to go. And it's something that we didn't think was possible. Now  I'm going to pass this around. This isn't a design  OK  So this is just a mechanical engineering sort of embodiment of it for you to play with. And it's clearly just a model. The working one is at MIT. I'm going to pass it to this handsome gentleman. At least you can decide whether it goes left or    Chris Anderson  Before you do it  for the people down in simulcast    Nicholas Negroponte  Sorry  I forgot. CA  Just show it off a bit. So wherever the camera is    OK  good point. Thank you  Chris. The idea was that it would be not only a laptop  but that it could transform into an electronic book. So it's sort of an electronic book. This is where when you go outside  it's in black and white. The games buttons are missing  but it'll also be a games machine  book machine. Set it up this way  and it's a television set. Etc.  etc.    is that enough for simulcast  OK  sorry. I'll let Jim decide which way to send it afterwards. OK. Seven countries. I say  maybe  for Massachusetts  because they actually have to do a bid. By law you've got to bid  and so on and so forth. So I can't quite name them. In the other cases  they don't have to do bids. They can decide    it's the federal government in each case. It's kind of agonizing  because a lot of people say   Let's do it at the state level   because states are more nimble than the feds  just because of size. And yet we count. We're really dealing with the federal government. We're really dealing with ministries of education. And if you look at governments around the world  ministries of education tend to be the most conservative  and also the ones that have huge payrolls. Everybody thinks they know about education  a lot of culture is built into it as well. It's really hard. And so it's certainly the hard road. If you look at the countries  they're pretty geoculturally distributed. Have they all agreed  No  not completely. Probably Thailand  Brazil and Nigeria are the three that are the most active and most agreed. We're purposely not signing anything with anybody until we actually have the working ones. And since I visit each one of those countries within at least every three months  I'm just going around the world every three weeks. Here's sort of the schedule and I put at the bottom we might give some away free in two years at this meeting. Everybody says it's a      laptop    you can't do it. Well  guess what  we're not. We're coming in probably at      to start  then drift down. And that's very important  because so many things hit the market at a price and then drift up. It's kind of the loss leader  and then as soon as it looks interesting  it can't be afforded  or it can't be scaled out. So we're targeting    dollars in     . The gray market's a big issue. And one of the ways    just one    but one of the ways to help in the case of the gray market is to make something that is so utterly unique    It's a little bit like the fact that automobiles    thousands of automobiles are stolen every day in the United States. Not one single post office truck is stolen. And why  Because there's no market for post office trucks. It looks like a post office truck. You can spray paint it. You can do anything you want. I just learned recently  in South Africa  no white Volvos are stolen. Period. None. Zero. So we want to make it very much like a white Volvo. Each government has a task force. This perhaps is less interesting  but we're trying to get the governments to all work together and it's not easy. The economics of this is to start with the federal governments and then later  to subsequently go to other    whether it's child to child funding  so a child in this country buys one for a child in the developing world  maybe of the same gender  maybe of the same age. An uncle gives a niece or a nephew that as a birthday present. I mean  there are all sorts of things that will happen  and they'll be very  very exciting. And everybody says    I say    it's an education project. Are we providing the software  The answer is  The system certainly has software  but no  we're not providing the education content. That is really done in the countries. But we are certainly constructionists. And we certainly believe in learning by doing and everything from Logo  which was started in       to more modern things  like Scratch  if you've ever even heard of it  are very  very much part of it. And that's the rollout. Are we dreaming  Is this real  It actually is real. The only criticism  and people really don't want to criticize this  because it is a humanitarian effort  a nonprofit effort and to criticize it is a little bit stupid  actually. But the one thing that people could criticize was   Great idea  but these guys can't do it.  And that could either mean these guys  professors and so on couldn't do it  or that it's not possible. Well  on December     a company called Quanta agreed to build it  and since they make about one third of all the laptops on the planet today  that question disappeared. So it's not a matter of whether it's going to happen. It is going to happen. And if it comes out at     dollars  so what  If it comes out six months late  so what  That's a pretty soft landing. Thank you. I'm really excited to be here today. I'll show you some stuff that's just ready to come out of the lab  literally  and I'm really glad that you guys are going to be among the first to see it in person  because I really think this is going to really change the way we interact with machines from this point on. Now  this is a rear projected drafting table. It's about    inches wide and it's equipped with a multi touch sensor. Normal touch sensors that you see  like on a kiosk or interactive whiteboards  can only register one point of contact at a time. This thing allows you to have multiple points at the same time. They can use both my hands  I can use chording actions  I can just go right up and use all    fingers if I wanted to. You know  like that. Now  multi touch sensing isn't completely new. People like Bill Buxton have been playing around with it in the '  s. However  the approach I built here is actually high resolution  low cost  and probably most importantly  very scalable. So  the technology  you know  isn't the most exciting thing here right now  other than probably its newfound accessibility. What's really interesting here is what you can do with it and the kind of interfaces you can build on top of it. So let's see. So  for instance  we have a lava lamp application here. Now  you can see  I can use both of my hands to kind of squeeze and put the blobs together. I can inject heat into the system here  or I can pull it apart with two of my fingers. It's completely intuitive  there's no instruction manual. The interface just kind of disappears. This started out as a screensaver app that one of the Ph.D. students in our lab  Ilya Rosenberg  made. But I think its true identity comes out here. Now what's great about a multi touch sensor is that  you know  I could be doing this with as many fingers here  but of course multi touch also inherently means multi user. Chris could be interacting with another part of Lava  while I play around with it here. You can imagine a new kind of sculpting tool  where I'm kind of warming something up  making it malleable  and then letting it cool down and solidifying in a certain state. Google should have something like this in their lobby. I'll show you a little more of a concrete example here  as this thing loads. This is a photographer's light box application. Again  I can use both of my hands to interact and move photos around. But what's even cooler is that if I have two fingers  I can actually grab a photo and then stretch it out like that really easily. I can pan  zoom and rotate it effortlessly. I can do that grossly with both of my hands  or I can do it just with two fingers on each of my hands together. If I grab the canvas  I can do the same thing    stretch it out. I can do it simultaneously  holding this down  and gripping on another one  stretching this out. Again  the interface just disappears here. There's no manual. This is exactly what you expect  especially if you haven't interacted with a computer before. Now  when you have initiatives like the      laptop  I kind of cringe at the idea of introducing a whole new generation to computing with this standard mouse and windows pointer interface. This is something that I think is really the way we should be interacting with machines from now on. Now  of course  I can bring up a keyboard. And I can bring that around  put that up there. Obviously  this is a standard keyboard  but of course I can rescale it to make it work well for my hands. That's really important  because there's no reason in this day and age that we should be conforming to a physical device. That leads to bad things  like RSI. We have so much technology nowadays that these interfaces should start conforming to us. There's so little applied now to actually improving the way we interact with interfaces from this point on. This keyboard is probably actually the really wrong direction to go. You can imagine  in the future  as we develop this kind of technology  a keyboard that kind of automatically drifts as your hand moves away  and really intelligently anticipates which key you're trying to stroke. So    again  isn't this great  Audience  Where's your lab  Jeff Han  I'm a research scientist at NYU in New York. Here's an example of another kind of app. I can make these little fuzz balls. It'll remember the strokes I'm making. Of course I can do it with all my hands. It's pressure sensitive. What's neat about that is  I showed that two finger gesture that zooms in really quickly. Because you don't have to switch to a hand tool or the magnifying glass tool  you can just continuously make things in real multiple scales  all at the same time. I can create big things out here  but I can go back and really quickly go back to where I started  and make even smaller things here. This is going to be really important as we start getting to things like data visualization. For instance  I think we all enjoyed Hans Rosling's talk  and he really emphasized the fact I've been thinking about for a long time  We have all this great data  but for some reason  it's just sitting there. We're not accessing it. And one of the reasons why I think that is will be helped by things like graphics and visualization and inference tools  but I also think a big part of it is going to be having better interfaces  to be able to drill down into this kind of data  while still thinking about the big picture here. Let me show you another app here. This is called WorldWind. It's done by NASA. We've all seen Google Earth  this is an open source version of that. There are plug ins to be able to load in different data sets that NASA's collected over the years. As you can see  I can use the same two fingered gestures to go down and go in really seamlessly. There's no interface  again. It really allows anybody to kind of go in    and it just does what you'd expect  you know  Again  there's just no interface here. The interface just disappears. I can switch to different data views. That's what's neat about this app here. NASA's really cool. These hyper spectral images are false colored so you can    it's really good for determining vegetative use. Well  let's go back to this. The great thing about mapping applications    it's not really  D  it's  D. So  again  with a multi point interface  you can do a gesture like this    so you can be able to tilt around like that    It's not just simply relegated to a kind of  D panning and motion. This gesture is just putting two fingers down    it's defining an axis of tilt    and I can tilt up and down that way. We just came up with that on the spot  it's probably not the right thing to do  but there's such interesting things you can do with this interface. It's just so much fun playing around with it  too. And so the last thing I want to show you is    I'm sure we can all think of a lot of entertainment apps that you can do with this thing. I'm more interested in the creative applications we can do with this. Now  here's a simple application here    I can draw out a curve. And when I close it  it becomes a character. But the neat thing about it is I can add control points. And then what I can do is manipulate them with both of my fingers at the same time. And you notice what it does. It's kind of a puppeteering thing  where I can use as many fingers as I have to draw and make    Now  there's a lot of actual math going on under here for this to control this mesh and do the right thing. This technique of being able to manipulate a mesh here  with multiple control points  is actually state of the art. It was released at SIGGRAPH last year. It's a great example of the kind of research I really love  all this compute power to make things do the right things  intuitive things  to do exactly what you expect. So  multi touch interaction research is a very active field right now in HCI. I'm not the only one doing it  a lot of other people are getting into it. This kind of technology is going to let even more people get into it  I'm looking forward to interacting with all of you over the next few days and seeing how it can apply to your respective fields. Thank you. Hi  everyone. I'm Sirena. I'm    years old and from Connecticut. Well  I'm not really sure why I'm here. I mean  what does this have to do with technology  entertainment and design  Well  I count my iPod  cellphone and computer as technology  but this has nothing to do with that. So I did a little research on it. Well  this is what I found. Of course  I hope I can memorize it. The violin is made of a wood box and four metal strings. By pulling a string  it vibrates and produces a sound wave  which passes through a piece of wood called a bridge  and goes down to the wood box and gets amplified  but ... let me think. Placing your finger at different places on the fingerboard changes the string length  and that changes the frequency of the sound wave. OK  this is sort of technology  but I can call it a   th century technology. But actually  the most fascinating thing that I found was that even the audio system or wave transmission nowadays are still based on the same principle of producing and projecting sound. Isn't that cool  Design    I love its design. I remember when I was little  my mom asked me   Would you like to play the violin or the piano   I looked at that giant monster and said to myself     I am not going to lock myself on that bench the whole day   This is small and lightweight. I can play from standing  sitting or walking. And  you know what  The best of all is that if I don't want to practice  The violin is very beautiful. Some people relate it as the shape of a lady. But whether you like it or not  it's been so for more than     years  unlike modern stuff  that  easily looks dated. But I think it's very personal and unique that  although each violin looks pretty similar  no two violins sound the same    even from the same maker or based on the same model. Entertainment    I love the entertainment. But actually  the instrument itself isn't very entertaining. I mean  when I first got my violin and tried to play around on it  it was actually really bad  because it didn't sound the way I'd heard from other kids    it was so horrible and so scratchy. So  it wasn't entertaining at all. But besides  my brother found this very funny  Yuk  Yuk  Yuk  A few years later  I heard a joke about the greatest violinist  Jascha Heifetz. After Mr. Heifetz's concert  a lady came over and complimented him   Oh  Mr. Heifetz  your violin sounded so great tonight   And Mr. Heifetz was a very cool person  so he picked up his violin and said   Funny    I don't hear anything.  Now I realize that as the musician  we human beings  with our great mind  artistic heart and skill  can change this   th century technology and a legendary design to a wonderful entertainment. Now I know why I'm here. At first  I thought I was just going to be here to perform  but unexpectedly  I learned and enjoyed much more. But ... although some of the talks were quite up there for me. Like the multi dimension stuff. I mean  honestly  I'd be happy enough if I could actually get my two dimensions correct in school. But actually  the most impressive thing to me is that    well  actually  I would also like to say this for all children is to say thank you to all adults  for actually caring for us a lot  and to make our future world much better. Thank you. Thank you  Thank you very much. Like the speaker before me    I am a TED virgin  I guess. I'm also the first time here  and ... I don't know what to say  I'm really happy that Mr. Anderson invited me. I'm really grateful that I get a chance to play for everyone. And the song that I just played was by Josef Hofmann. It's called  Kaleidoscope.  And Hofmann is a Polish pianist and composer of the late   th century  and he's widely considered one of the greatest pianists of all time. I have another piece that I'd like to play for you. It's called  Abegg Variations   by Robert Schumann  a German   th century composer. The name  Abegg  is actually A B E G G  and that's the main theme in the melody. That comes from the last name of one of Schumann's female friends. But he wrote that for his wife. So actually  if you listen carefully  there are supposed to be five variations on this Abegg theme. It's written around       so even though it's old  I hope you'll like it. Now comes the part that I hate. Well  because Mr. Anderson told me that this session is called  Sync and Flow   I was wondering   What do I know that these geniuses don't   So  I'll talk about musical composition  even though I don't know where to start. How do I compose  I think Yamaha does a really good job of teaching us how to compose. What I do first is  I make a lot of little musical ideas you can just improvise here at the piano    and I choose one of those to become my main theme  my main melody  like the Abegg that you just heard. And once I choose my main theme  I have to decide  Out of all the styles in music  what kind of style do I want  And this year  I composed a Romantic style. So for inspiration  I listened to Liszt and Tchaikovsky and all the great Romantic composers. Next  I make the structure of the entire piece with my teachers. They help me plan out the whole piece. And then the hard part is filling it in with musical ideas  because then you have to think. And then  when the piece takes somewhat of a solified form    solidified  excuse me    solidified form  you're supposed to actually polish the piece  polish the details  and then polish the overall performance of the composition. And another thing that I enjoy doing is drawing. Drawing  because I like to draw  you know  Japanese anime art. I think that's a craze among teens right now. And once I realized it  there's a parallel between creating music and creating art  because for your motive  or your little initial idea for your drawing  it's your character    you want to decide who you want to draw  or if you want to draw an original character. And then you want to decide  How are you going to draw the character  Like  am I going to use one page  Am I going to draw it on the computer  Am I going to use a two page spread like a comic book  For a more grandiose effect  I guess. And then you have to do the initial sketch of the character  which is like your structure of a piece  and then you add pen and pencil  and whatever details that you need    that's polishing the drawing. And another thing that both of these have in common is your state of mind  because I know I'm one of those teenagers that are really easily distracted. So if I'm trying to do homework and I don't feel like it  I'll try to draw or  you know  waste my time. And then what happens is  sometimes I absolutely can't draw or I can't compose at all  and then it's like there's too much on your mind. You can't focus on what you're supposed to do. And sometimes  if you manage to use your time wisely and work on it  you'll get something out of it  but it doesn't come naturally. What happens is  if something magical happens  if something natural happens to you  you're able to produce all this beautiful stuff instantly  and then that's what I consider  flow   because that's when everything clicks and you're able to do anything. You feel like you're on top of your game and you can do anything you want. I'm not going to play my own composition today because  although I did finish it  it's way too long. Instead  I'd like to try something called  improvisation.  I have here seven note cards  one with each note of the musical alphabet. And I'd like someone to come up here and choose five    anyone to come up here and choose five    and then I can make it into some sort of melody  and I'll improvise it. Wow. A volunteer  yay  Jennifer Lin  Nice to meet you. Goldie Hawn  Thank you. Choose five  JL  Yes  five cards. Any five cards. GH  OK  one. JL  OK. GH  Two. JL  Yes. GH  Three. GH  Oh  D and F    too familiar. JL  One more. GH  OK.  E  for  effort.  JL  Would you mind reading them out in the order that you chose them  GH  OK    C  G  B  A and E. JL  Thank you very much  GH  You're welcome. And what about these  JL  I won't use them. Thank you  Now  she chose C  G  B  A  E. I'm going to try to put that in some sort of order. OK  that's nice. So  I'm going to have a moment to think  and I'll try to make something out of it. The next song  or the encore that I'm going to play is called  Bumble Boogie   by Jack Fina. In terms of invention  I'd like to tell you the tale of one of my favorite projects. I think it's one of the most exciting that I'm working on  but I think it's also the simplest. It's a project that has the potential to make a huge impact around the world. It addresses one of the biggest health issues on the planet  the number one cause of death in children under five. Which is ...  Water borne diseases  Diarrhea  Malnutrition  No. It's breathing the smoke from indoor cooking fires    acute respiratory infections caused by this. Can you believe that  I find this shocking and somewhat appalling. Can't we make cleaner burning cooking fuels  Can't we make better stoves  How is it that this can lead to over two million deaths every year  I know Bill Joy was talking to you about the wonders of carbon nanotubes  so I'm going to talk to you about the wonders of carbon macro tubes  which is charcoal. So this is a picture of rural Haiti. Haiti is now    percent deforested. You'll see scenes like this all over the island. It leads to all sorts of environmental problems and problems that affect people throughout the nation. A couple years ago there was severe flooding that led to thousands of deaths    that's directly attributable to the fact that there are no trees on the hills to stabilize the soil. So the rains come    they go down the rivers and the flooding happens. Now one of the reasons why there are so few trees is this  people need to cook  and they harvest wood and they make charcoal in order to do it. It's not that people are ignorant to the environmental damage. They know perfectly well  but they have no other choice. Fossil fuels are not available  and solar energy doesn't cook the way that they like their food prepared. And so this is what they do. You'll find families like this who go out into the forest to find a tree  cut it down and make charcoal out of it. So not surprisingly  there's a lot of effort that's been done to look at alternative cooking fuels. About four years ago  I took a team of students down to Haiti and we worked with Peace Corps volunteers there. This is one such volunteer and this is a device that he had built in the village where he worked. And the idea was that you could take waste paper  you could compress it and make briquettes that could be used for fuel. But this device was very slow. So our engineering students went to work on it and with some very simple changes  they were able to triple the throughput of this device. So you could imagine they were very excited about it. And they took the briquettes back to MIT so that they could test them. And one of the things that they found was they didn't burn. So it was a little discouraging to the students. And in fact  if you look closely  right here you can see it says   US Peace Corps.  As it turns out  there actually wasn't any waste paper in this village. And while it was a good use of government paperwork for this volunteer to bring it back with him to his village  it was     kilometers away. And so we thought perhaps there might be a better way to come up with an alternative cooking fuel. What we wanted to do is we wanted to make a fuel that used something that was readily available on the local level. You see these all over Haiti as well. They're small scale sugar mills. And the waste product from them after you extract the juice from the sugarcane is called  bagasse.  It has no other use. It has no nutritional value  so they don't feed it to the animals. It just sits in a pile near the sugar mill until eventually they burn it. What we wanted to do was we wanted to find a way to harness this waste resource and turn it into a fuel that would be something that people could easily cook with  something like charcoal. So over the next couple of years  students and I worked to develop a process. So you start with the bagasse  and then you take a very simple kiln that you can make out of a waste fifty five gallon oil drum. After some time  after setting it on fire  you seal it to restrict the oxygen that goes into the kiln  and then you end up with this carbonized material here. However  you can't burn this. It's too fine and it burns too quickly to be useful for cooking. So we had to try to find a way to form it into useful briquettes. And conveniently  one of my students was from Ghana  and he remembered a dish his mom used to make for him called  kokonte   which is a very sticky porridge made out of the cassava root. And so what we did was we looked  and we found that cassava is indeed grown in Haiti  under the name of  manioc.  In fact  it's grown all over the world    yucca  tapioca  manioc  cassava  it's all the same thing    a very starchy root vegetable. And you can make a very thick  sticky porridge out of it  which you can use to bind together the charcoal briquettes. So we did this. We went down to Haiti. These are the graduates of the first Ecole de Charbon  or Charcoal Institute. And these    That's right. So I'm actually an instructor at MIT as well as CIT. And these are the briquettes that we made. Now I'm going to take you to a different continent. This is India and this is the most commonly used cooking fuel in India. It's cow dung. And more than in Haiti  this produces really smoky fires  and this is where you see the health impacts of cooking with cow dung and biomass as a fuel. Kids and women are especially affected by it  because they're the ones who are around the cooking fires. So we wanted to see if we could introduce this charcoal making technology there. Well  unfortunately  they didn't have sugarcane and they didn't have cassava  but that didn't stop us. What we did was we found what were the locally available sources of biomass. And there was wheat straw and there was rice straw in this area. And what we could use as a binder was actually small amounts of cow manure  which they used ordinarily for their fuel. And we did side by side tests  and here you can see the charcoal briquettes and here the cow dung. And you can see that it's a lot cleaner burning of a cooking fuel. And in fact  it heats the water a lot more quickly. And so we were very happy  thus far. But one of the things that we found was when we did side by side comparisons with wood charcoal  it didn't burn as long. And the briquettes crumbled a little bit and we lost energy as they fell apart as they were cooking. So we wanted to try to find a way to make a stronger briquette so that we could compete with wood charcoal in the markets in Haiti. So we went back to MIT  we took out the Instron machine and we figured out what sort of forces you needed in order to compress a briquette to the level that you actually are getting improved performance out of it  And at the same time that we had students in the lab looking at this  we also had community partners in Haiti working to develop the process  to improve it and make it more accessible to people in the villages there. And after some time  we developed a low cost press that allows you to produce charcoal  which actually now burns not only    actually  it burns longer  cleaner than wood charcoal. So now we're in a situation where we have a product  which is actually better than what you can buy in Haiti in the marketplace  which is a very wonderful place to be. In Haiti alone  about    million trees are cut down every year. There's a possibility of this being implemented and saving a good portion of those. In addition  the revenue generated from that charcoal is     million dollars. That's an awful lot for a country like Haiti    with a population of eight million and an average income of less than     dollars. So this is where we're also moving ahead with our charcoal project. And one of the things that I think is also interesting  is I have a friend up at UC Berkeley who's been doing risk analysis. And he's looked at the problem of the health impacts of burning wood versus charcoal. And he's found that worldwide  you could prevent a million deaths switching from wood to charcoal as a cooking fuel. That's remarkable  but up until now  there weren't ways to do it without cutting down trees. But now we have a way that's using an agricultural waste material to create a cooking fuel. One of the really exciting things  though  is something that came out of the trip that I took to Ghana just last month. And I think it's the coolest thing  and it's even lower tech than what you just saw  if you can imagine such a thing. Here it is. So what is this  This is corncobs turned into charcoal. And the beauty of this is that you don't need to form briquettes    it comes ready made. This is my      laptop  right here. And actually  like Nick  I brought samples. So we can pass these around. They're fully functional  field tested  ready to roll out. And I think one of the things which is also remarkable about this technology  is that the technology transfer is so easy. Compared to the sugarcane charcoal  where we have to teach people how to form it into briquettes and you have the extra step of cooking the binder  this comes pre briquetted. And this is about the most exciting thing in my life right now  which is perhaps a sad commentary on my life. But once you see it  like you guys in the front row    All right  yeah  OK. So anyway    Here it is. And this is  I think  a perfect example of what Robert Wright was talking about in those non zero sum things. So not only do you have health benefits  you have environmental benefits. But this is one of the incredibly rare situations where you also have economic benefits. People can make their own cooking fuel from waste products. They can generate income from this. They can save the money that they were going to spend on charcoal and they can produce excess and sell it in the market to people who aren't making their own. It's really rare that you don't have trade offs between health and economics  or environment and economics. So this is a project that I just find extremely exciting and I'm really looking forward to see where it takes us. So when we talk about  now  the future we will create  one of the things that I think is necessary is to have a very clear vision of the world that we live in. And now  I don't actually mean the world that we live in. I mean the world where women spend two to three hours everyday grinding grain for their families to eat. I mean the world where advanced building materials means cement roofing tiles that are made by hand  and where  when you work    hours a day  you're still only earning    dollars in a month. I mean the world where women and children spend    billion hours a year fetching water. That's as if the entire workforce of the state of California worked full time for a year doing nothing but fetching water. It's a place where  for example  if this were India  in this room  only three of us would have a car. If this were Afghanistan  only one person in this room would know how the use the Internet. If this were Zambia        of you would be farmers      of you would have AIDS or HIV. And more than half of you would be living on less than a dollar a day. These are the issues that we need to come up with solutions for. These are the issues that we need to be training our engineers  our designers  our business people  our entrepreneurs to be facing. These are the solutions that we need to find. I have a few areas that I believe are especially important that we address. One of them is creating technologies to promote micro finance and micro enterprise  so that people who are living below the poverty line can find a way to move out    and that they're not doing it using the same traditional basket making  poultry rearing  etc. But there are new technologies and new products that they can make on a small scale. The next thing I believe is that we need to create technologies for poor farmers to add value to their own crops. And we need to rethink our development strategies  so that we're not promoting educational campaigns to get them to stop being farmers  but rather to stop being poor farmers. And we need to think about how we can do that effectively. We need to work with the people in these communities and give them the resources and the tools that they need to solve their own problems. That's the best way to do it. We shouldn't be doing it from outside. So we need to create this future  and we need to start doing it now. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Thank you  incredible. Stay here. Tell us    just while we see if someone has a question    just tell us about one of the other things that you've worked on. Amy Smith  Some of the other things we're working on are ways to do low cost water quality testing  so that communities can maintain their own water systems  know when they're working  know when they treat them  etc. We're also looking at low cost water treatment systems. One of the really exciting things is looking at solar water disinfection and improving the ability to be able to do that. CA  What's the bottleneck preventing this stuff getting from scale  Do you need to find entrepreneurs  or venture capitalists  or what do you need to take what you've got and get it to scale  AS  I think it's large numbers of people moving it forward. It's a difficult thing    it's a marketplace which is very fragmented and a consumer population with no income. So you can't use the same models that you use in the United States for making things move forward. And we're a pretty small staff  which is me. So  you know  I do what I can with the students. We have    students a year go out into the field and try to implement this and move it forward. The other thing is you have to do things with a long time frame  as  you know  you can't expect to get something done in a year or two years  you have to be looking five or    years ahead. But I think with the vision to do that  we can move forward. My name is Lovegrove. I only know nine Lovegroves  two of which are my parents. They are first cousins  and you know what happens when  you know    So there's a terribly weird freaky side to me  which I'm fighting with all the time. So to try and get through today  I've kind of disciplined myself with an    minute talk. I was hanging on to have a pee. I thought perhaps if I was hanging on long enough  that would guide me through the    minutes. OK. I am known as Captain Organic and that's a philosophical position as well as an aesthetic position. But today what I'd like to talk to you about is that love of form and how form can touch people's soul and emotion. Not very long ago  not many thousands of years ago  we actually lived in caves  and I don't think we've lost that coding system. We respond so well to form. But I'm interested in creating intelligent form. I'm not interested at all in blobism or any of that superficial rubbish that you see coming out as design. This artificially induced consumerism    I think it's atrocious. My world is the world of people like Amory Lovins  Janine Benyus  James Watson. I'm in that world  but I work purely instinctively. I'm not a scientist. I could have been  perhaps  but I work in this world where I trust my instincts. So I am a   st century translator of technology into products that we use everyday and relate beautifully and naturally with. And we should be developing things    we should be developing packaging for ideas which elevate people's perceptions and respect for the things that we dig out of the earth and translate into products for everyday use. So  the water bottle. I'll begin with this concept of what I call DNA. DNA  Design  Nature  Art. These are the three things that condition my world. Here is a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci      years ago  before photography. It shows how observation  curiosity and instinct work to create amazing art. Industrial design is the art form of the   st century. People like Leonardo    there have not been many    had this amazingly instinctive curiosity. I work from a similar position. I don't want to sound pretentious saying that  but this is my drawing made on a digital pad a couple of years ago    well into the   st century      years later. It's my impression of water. Impressionism being the most valuable art form on the planet as we know it      million dollars  easily  for a Monet. I use  now  a whole new process. A few years ago I reinvented my process to keep up with people like Greg Lynn  Thom Mayne  Zaha Hadid  Rem Koolhaas    all these people that I think are persevering and pioneering with fantastic new ideas of how to create form. This is all created digitally. Here you see the machining  the milling of a block of acrylic. This is what I show to the client to say   That's what I want to do.  At that point  I don't know if that's possible at all. It's a seductor  but I just feel in my bones that that's possible. So we go  we look at the tooling. We look at how that is produced. These are the invisible things that you never see in your life. This is the background noise of industrial design. That is like an Anish Kapoor flowing through a Richard Serra. It is more valuable than the product in my eyes. I don't have one. When I do make some money  I'll have one machined for myself. This is the final product. When they sent it to me  I thought I'd failed. It felt like nothing. It has to feel like nothing. It was when I put the water in that I realized that I'd put a skin on water itself. It's an icon of water itself  and it elevates people's perception of contemporary design. Each bottle is different  meaning the water level will give you a different shape. It's mass individualism from a single product. It fits the hand. It fits arthritic hands. It fits children's hands. It makes the product strong  the tessellation. It's a millefiori of ideas. In the future  they will look like that  because we need to move away from those type of polymers and use that for medical equipment and more important things  perhaps  in life. Biopolymers  these new ideas for materials  will come into play in probably a decade. It doesn't look as cool  does it  But I can live up to that. I don't have a problem with that. I design for that condition  biopolymers. It's the future. I took this video in Cape Town last year. This is the freaky side coming out. I have this special interest in things like this  which blow my mind. I don't know whether to  you know  drop to my knees  cry  I don't know what I think. But I just know that nature    nature improves with ever greater purpose that which once existed  and that strangeness is a consequence of innovative thinking. When I look at these things  they look pretty normal to me. But these things evolved over many years  and what we're trying to do    I get three weeks to design a telephone. How the hell do I do that  when you get these things that take hundreds of millions of years to evolve  How do you condense that  It comes back to instinct. I'm not talking about designing telephones that look like that and I'm not looking at designing architecture like that. I'm just interested in natural growth patterns and the beautiful forms that only nature really creates. How that flows through me and how that comes out is what I'm trying to understand. This is a scan through the human forearm. It's then blown up through rapid prototyping to reveal its cellular structure. I have these in my office. My office is a mixture of the Natural History Museum and a NASA space lab. It's a weird  kind of freaky place. This is one of my specimens. This is made    bone is made from a mixture of inorganic minerals and polymers. I studied cooking in school for four years  and in that experience  which was called  domestic science   it was a bit of a cheap trick for me to try and get a science qualification. Actually  I put marijuana in everything I cooked    And I had access to all the best girls. It was fabulous. All the guys in the rugby team couldn't understand. Anyway    this is a meringue. This is another sample I have. A meringue is made exactly the same way  in my estimation  as a bone. It's made from polysaccharides and proteins. If you pour water on that  it dissolves. Could we be manufacturing from foodstuffs in the future  Not a bad idea. I don't know. I need to talk to Janine and a few other people about that  but I believe instinctively that that meringue can become something  a car    I don't know. I'm also interested in growth patterns  the unbridled way that nature grows things so you're not restricted by form at all. These interrelated forms  they do inspire everything I do  although I might end up making something incredibly simple. This is a detail of a chair that I've designed in magnesium. It shows this interlocution of elements and the beauty of  kind of  engineering and biological thinking  shown pretty much as a bone structure. Any one of those elements you could sort of hang on the wall as some kind of art object. It's the world's first chair made in magnesium. It cost  .  million dollars to develop. It's called  Go   by Bernhardt  USA. It went into Time magazine in      as the new language of the   st century. Boy. For somebody growing up in Wales in a little village  that's enough. It shows how you make one holistic form  like the car industry  and then you break up what you need. This is an absolutely beautiful way of working. It's a godly way of working. It's organic and it's essential. It's an absolutely fat free design  and when you look at it  you see human beings. When that moves into polymers  you can change the elasticity  the fluidity of the form. This is an idea for a gas injected  one piece polymer chair. What nature does is it drills holes in things. It liberates form. It takes away anything extraneous. That's what I do. I make organic things which are essential. And they look funky  too    but I don't set out to make funky things because I think that's an absolute disgrace. I set out to look at natural forms. If you took the idea of fractal technology further  take a membrane  shrinking it down constantly like nature does    that could be a seat for a chair. It could be a sole for a sports shoe. It could be a car blending into seats. Wow. Let's go for it. That's the kind of stuff. This is what exists in nature. Observation now allows us to bring that natural process into the design process every day. That's what I do. This is a show that's currently on in Tokyo. It's called  Superliquidity.  It's my sculptural investigation. It's like   st century Henry Moore. When you see a Henry Moore  still  your hair stands up. There's some amazing spiritual connect. If he was a car designer  phew  we'd all be driving one. In his day  he was the highest taxpayer in Britain. That is the power of organic design. It contributes immensely to our    sense of being  our sense of relationships with things  our sensuality and  you know  the sort of    even the sort of socio erotic side  which is very important. This is my artwork. This is all my process. These actually are sold as artwork. They're very big prints. But this is how I get to that object. Ironically  that object was made by the Killarney process  which is a brand new process here for the   st century  and I can hear Greg Lynn laughing his socks off as I say that. I'll tell you about that later. When I look into these data images  I see new things. It's self inspired. Diatomic structures  radiolaria  the things that we couldn't see but we can do now    these  again  are cored out. They're made virtually from nothing. They're made from silica. Why not structures from cars like that  Coral  all these natural forces  take away what they don't need and they deliver maximum beauty. We need to be in that realm. I want to do stuff like that. This is a new chair which should come on the market in September. It's for a company called Moroso in Italy. It's a gas injected polymer chair. Those holes you see there are very filtered down  watered down versions of the extremity of the diatomic structures. It goes with the flow of the polymer and you'll see    there's an image coming up right now that shows the full thing. It's great to have companies in Italy who support this way of dreaming. If you see the shadows that come through that  they're actually probably more important than the product  but it's the minimum it takes. The coring out of the back lets you breathe. It takes away any material you don't need and it actually garners flexure too. I was going to break into a dance then. This is some current work I'm doing. I'm looking at single surface structures and how they stretch and flow. It's based on furniture typologies  but that's not the end motivation. It's made from aluminum ... as opposed to aluminium  and it's grown. It's grown in my mind  and then it's grown in terms of the whole process that I go through. This is two weeks ago in CCP in Coventry  who build parts for Bentleys and so on. It's being built as we speak and it will be on show in Phillips next year in New York. I have a big show with Phillips Auctioneers. When I see these animations  oh Jesus  I'm blown away. This is what goes on in my studio everyday. I walk    I'm traveling. I come back. Some guy's got that on a computer    there's this like  oh my goodness. So I try to create this energy of invention every day in my studio. This kind of effervescent    fully charged sense of soup that delivers ideas. Single surface products. Furniture's a good one. How you grow legs out of a surface. I would love to build this one day and perhaps I'd like to build it also out of flour  sugar  polymer  wood chips    I don't know  human hair. I don't know. I'd love a go at that. I don't know. If I just got some time. That's the weird side coming out again. A lot of companies don't understand that. Three weeks ago I was with Sony in Tokyo. They said   Give us the dream. What is our dream  How do we beat Apple   I said   You don't copy Apple  that's for sure. You get into biopolymers.  They looked straight through me. What a waste. Anyway. No  it's true. Fuck them. You know  I mean    I'm delivering  they're not taking. I've had this image    years. I've had this image of a water droplet for    years  sitting on a hot bed. That is an image of a car for me. That's the car of the future. It's a water droplet. I've been banging on about this like I can't believe. Cars are all wrong. I'm going to show you something a bit weird now. They laughed everywhere over the world I showed this. The only place that didn't laugh was Moscow. Cars are made from        components. How ridiculous is that  Couldn't you make that from      It's got a vacuum formed  carbon nylon pan. Everything's holistically integrated. It opens and closes like a bread bin. There is no engine. There's a solar panel on the back and there are batteries in the wheels  they're fitted like Formula  . You take them off your wall  you plug them in. Off you go. A three wheeled car  slow  feminine  transparent  so you can see the people in there. You drive different. You see that thing. You do. You do. And not anesthetized  separated from life. There's a hole at the front and there's a reason for that. It's a city car. You drive along. You get out. You drive on to a proboscis. You get out. It lifts you up. It presents the solar panel to the sun  and at night  it's a street lamp. That's what happens if you get inspired by the street lamp first  and do the car second. I can see these bubbles with these hydrogen packages  floating around on the ground  driven by AI. When I showed this in South Africa  everybody afterwards was going   Hey  car on a stick. Like this.  Can you imagine  A car on a stick. If you put it next to contemporary architecture  it feels totally natural to me. And that's what I do with my furniture. I'm not putting Charles Eames' furniture in buildings anymore. I'm trying to build furniture which fits architecture. I'm trying to build transportation systems. I work on aircraft for Airbus  I do all this sort of stuff trying to force these natural  inspired by nature dreams home. I'm going to finish on two things. This is the stereolithography of a staircase. It's a little bit of a dedication to James  James Watson. I built this thing for my studio. It cost me         dollars to build this. Most people go and buy the Aston Martin. I built this. This is the data that goes with that. Incredibly complex. Took about two years  because I'm looking for fat free design. Lean  efficient things. Healthy products. This is built by composites. It's a single element which rotates around to create a holistic element  and this is a carbon fiber handrail which is only supported in two places. Modern materials allow us to do modern things. This is a shot in the studio. This is how it looks pretty much every day. You wouldn't want to have a fear of heights coming down it. There is virtually no handrail. It doesn't pass any standards. Who cares  And it has an internal handrail which gives it its strength. It's this holistic integration. That's my studio. It's subterranean. It's in Notting Hill  next to all the crap    the prostitutes and all that stuff. It's next to David Hockney's original studio. It has a lighting system that changes throughout the day. My guys go out for lunch. The door's open. They come back in  because it's normally raining and they prefer to stay in. This is my studio. Elephant skull from Oxford University      . I bought that last year. They're very difficult to find. If anybody's got a whale skeleton they want to sell me  I'll put it in the studio. So I'm just going to interject a little bit with some of the things that you'll see in the video. It's a homemade video  made it myself at three o'clock in the morning just to show you how my real world is. You never see that. You never see architects or designers showing you their real world. This is called a  Plasnet.  It's a new bio polycarbonate chair I'm doing in Italy. World's first bamboo bike with folding handlebars. We should all be riding one of these. As China buys all these crappy cars  we should be riding things like this. Counterbalance. Like I say  it's a cross between Natural History Museum and a NASA laboratory. It's full of prototypes and objects. It's self inspirational  again. I mean  the rare times when I'm there  I do enjoy it. And I get lots and lots of kids coming. I'm a contaminator for all those children of investment bankers    wankers. Sorry. That's a solar seed. It's a concept for new architecture. That thing on the top is the world's first solar powered garden lamp    the first produced. Giles Revell should be talking here today    amazing photography of things you can't see. The first sculptural model I made for that thing in Tokyo. Lots of stuff. There's a little leaf chair    that golden looking thing is called  Leaf.  It's made from Kevlar. On the wall is my book called  Supernatural   which allows me to remember what I've done  because I forget. There's an aerated brick I did in Limoges last year  in Concepts for New Ceramics in Architecture. Gernot Oberfell  working at three o'clock in the morning    and I don't pay overtime. Overtime is the passion of design  so join the club or don't. No  it's true. People like Tom and Greg    we're traveling like you can't    we fit it all in. I don't know how we do it. Next week I'm at Electrolux in Sweden  then I'm in Beijing on Friday. You work that one out. And when I see Ed's photographs  I think  why the hell am I going to China  It's true. It's true. Because there's a soul in this whole thing. We need to have a new instinct for the   st century. We need to combine all this stuff. If all the people who were talking over this period worked on a car together  it would be a joy  absolute joy. So there's a new X light system I'm doing in Japan. There's Tuareg shoes from North Africa. There's a Kifwebe mask. These are my sculptures. A copper jelly mold. It sounds like some quiz show or something  doesn't it  So  it's going to end. Thank you  James  for your great inspiration. Thank you very much. I'm Rich Baraniuk and what I'd like to talk a little bit about today are some ideas that I think have just tremendous resonance with all the things that have been talked about the last two days. So many different points of resonance that it's going to be difficult to bring them all up  but I'll try to do my best. Does anybody remember these  OK  so these are LP records and they've been replaced  right  They've been swept away over the last two decades by these types of world flattening digitization technologies  right  And I think it was best witnessed when Thomas was playing the music as we came in the room today. What's happened in the music world is there's a culture  or an ecosystem that's been created that  if you take some words from Apple  the catchphrase    that we create  rip  mix and burn. What I mean by that is that anyone in the world is free and allowed to create new music and musical ideas. Anyone in the world is allowed to rip or copy musical ideas  use them in innovative ways. Anyone is allowed to mix them in different types of ways  draw connections between musical ideas  and people can burn them or create final products and continue the circle. And what that's done is it's created  like I said  a vibrant community that's very inclusive  with people continually working to connect musical ideas  innovate them and keep things constantly up to date. Today's hit single is not last year's hit single. But I'm not here to talk about music today. I'm here to talk about books. In particular  textbooks and the kind of educational materials that we use every day in school. Has anyone here ever been to school  OK  does anybody realize there's a crisis in our schools  around the world  I'm not going to spend too much time on that  but what I want to talk about is some of the disconnects that appear when an author publishes a book. That in fact  the publishing process    just because of the fact that it's complicated  it's heavy  books are expensive    creates a sort of a wall between authors of books and the ultimate users of books  be they teachers  students or just general readers. And this is even more true if you happen to speak a language other than one of the world's major languages  and especially English. I'm going to call these people below the barrier  shutouts  because they're really shut out of the process of being able to share their knowledge with the world. And so what I want to talk about today is trying to take these ideas that we've seen in the musical culture and try to bring these towards reinventing the way we think about writing books  using them and teaching from them. So  that's what I'd like to talk about and  really  how we get from where we are now to where we need to go. The first thing I'd like you to do is a little thought experiment. Imagine taking all the world's books. OK  everybody imagine books and imagine just tearing out the pages. So  liberating these pages and imagine digitizing them and then storing them in a vast  interconnected  global repository. Think of it as a massive iTunes for book type content. And then take that material and imagine making it all open  so that people can modify it  play with it  improve it. Imagine making it free  so that anyone in the world can have access to all of this knowledge  and imagine using information technology so that you can update this content  improve it  play with it  on a timescale that's more on the order of seconds instead of years. Instead of editions of a book coming out every two years  imagine them coming out every    seconds. So  imagine we could do that and imagine we could put people into this. So that we could truly build an ecosystem with not just authors  but all the people who could be or want to be authors in all the different languages of the world  and I think if you could do this  it would be called    I'm just going to refer to it as a knowledge ecosystem. So  really  this is the dream  and in a sense what you can think of it is we're trying to enable anyone in the world  I mean anyone in the world    to be their own educational DJ  creating educational materials  sharing them with the world  constantly innovating on them. So  this is the dream. In fact  this dream is actually being realized. Over the last six and a half years  we've been working really hard at Rice University on a project called Connexions  and so what I'd like to do for the rest of the talk is just tell you a little bit about what people are doing with Connexions  which you can kind of think of as the counterpoint to Nicholas Negroponte's talk yesterday  where they're working on the hardware of bringing education to the world. We're working on the open source tools and the content. So  that's sort of to put it in perspective here. So  create. What are some of the people that are using these kind of tools  Well  the first thing is  there's a community of engineering professors  from Cambridge to Kyoto  who are developing engineering content in electrical engineering to develop what you can think of as a massive  super textbook that covers the entire area of electrical engineering. And not only that    it can be customized for use in each of their own individual institutions. If people like Kitty Jones  a shut out    a private music teacher and mom from Champagne  Illinois  who wanted to share her fantastic music content with the world  on how to teach kids how to play music    Her material is now used over         times per month. Tremendous use. In fact  a lot of this use coming from United States K    schools  because anyone who's involved in a school scale back  the first thing that's cut is the music curriculum. And so this is just indicating the tremendous thirst for this kind of open  free content. A lot of teachers are using this stuff. What about ripping  What about copying  reusing  A team of volunteers at the University of Texas at El Paso    graduate students translating this engineering super textbook ideas. And within about a week  having this be some of our most popular material in widespread use all over Latin America  and in particular in Mexico  because of the open  extensible nature of this. People  volunteers and even companies that are translating materials into Asian languages like Chinese  Japanese and Thai  to spread the knowledge even further. OK  what about people who are mixing  What does  mixing  mean   Mixing  means building customized courses  means building customized books. Companies like National Instruments  who are embedding very powerful  interactive simulations into the materials  so that we can go way beyond our regular kind of textbook to an experience that all the teaching materials are things you can actually interact with and play around with and actually learn as you do. We've been working with Teachers Without Borders  who are very interested in mixing our materials. They're going to be using Connexions as their platform to develop and deliver teaching materials for teaching teachers how to teach in    countries around the world. TWB is currently in Iraq  training        teachers supported by USAID. And to them  this idea of being able to remix and customize to the local context is extraordinarily important  because just providing free content to people has actually been likened by people in the developing world to a kind of cultural imperialism    that if you don't empower people with the ability to re contextualize the material  translate it into their own language and take ownership of it  it's not good. OK  other organizations we've been working with  UC Merced    people know about UC Merced. It's a new university in California  in the Central Valley  working very closely with community colleges. They're actually developing a lot of their science and engineering curriculum to spread widely around the world in our system. And they're also trying to develop all of their software tools completely open source. We've been working with AMD  which has a project called   x    which is trying to bring Internet connectivity to    percent of the world's population by     . We're going to be providing content to them in a whole range of different languages. And we've also been working with a number of other organizations. In particular  a bunch of the projects that are funded by Hewlett Foundation  who have taken a real leadership role in this area of open content. OK  burn    I think this is  sort of  quite interesting.  Burn  is the idea of trying to create the physical instantiation of one of these courses. And I think a lot of you received    I think all of you received one of these music books in your gift pack. A little present for you. Just to tell you quickly about it  this is an engineering textbook. It's about     pages long  hardbound. This costs    anybody guess  How much would it cost in a bookstore  Richard Baraniuk  OK. This costs    dollars to the student. Why does it cost    dollars  Because it's published on demand and it's developed from this repository of open materials. If this book were to be published by a regular publisher  it would cost at least     dollars. So what we're seeing is moving this burning or publication process from the regular  sort of single authored book towards community authored materials that are modular  that are customized to each individual class and published on demand very inexpensively  either pushed out through Amazon or published directly through an on demand press  like QOOP. And I think that this is an extraordinarily interesting area because there is tremendous area under this long tail in publishing. We're not talking about the Harry Potter end  right at the left side. We're talking about books on hypergeometric partial differential equations. Books that might sell     copies a year        copies a year. There is tremendous sustaining revenue under this long tail to sustain open projects like ours  but also to sustain this new emergence of on demand publishers  like QOOP  who produced these two books. And I think one of the things that you should take away from this talk is that there's an impending cut out the middle man disintermediation  that's going to be happening in the publishing industry. And it's going to reach a crescendo over the next few years  and I think that it's for our benefit  really  and for the world's benefit. OK  so what are the enablers  What's really making all of this happen  There's tons of technology  and the only piece of technology that I really want to talk about is XML. How many people know about XML  Oh  great. So it's the future of the web  right  It's semantic representation of content. And what you can really think of XML in this case is it's the packaging that we're putting around these pages. Remember we took the book  tore the pages out  Well  what the XML is going to do is it's going to turn those pages into Lego blocks. XML are the nubs on the Lego that allow us to combine the content together in a myriad different ways  and it provides us a framework to share content. So  it lets you take this ecosystem in its primordial state of all this content  all the pages you've torn out of books  and create highly sophisticated learning machines  books  courses  course packs. It gives you the ability to personalize the learning experience to each individual student  so that every student can have a book or a course that's customized to their learning style  their context  their language and the things that excite them. It lets you reuse the same materials in multiple different ways  and surprising new ways. It lets you interconnect ideas  indicating how fields relate to each other. And I'll just give you my personal story. We came up with this six and a half years ago because I teach the stuff in the red box. And my day job  as Chris said    I'm an electrical engineering professor. I teach signal processing and my challenge was to show that this math    Wow  about half of you have already fallen asleep just looking at the equation. But this seemingly dry math is actually the center of this tremendously powerful web that links technology    that links really cool applications like music synthesizers to tremendous economic opportunities  but also governed by intellectual property. And the thing that I realized is there was no way that I  as an engineer  could write this book that would get all of this across. We needed a community to do it and we needed new tools to be able to interconnect these ideas. And I think that really  in a sense  what we're trying to do is make Minsky's dream come to a reality  where you can imagine all the books in a library actually starting to talk to each other. And people who are teachers out here    whoever taught  you know this    it's the interconnections between ideas that teaching is really all about. OK  back to math. Imagine    this is possible  that every single equation that you click on in one of your new e texts is something that you're going to be able to explore and experiment with. So imagine your kid's algebra textbook in seventh grade. You can click on every single equation and bring up a little tool to be able to experiment with it  tinker with it  understand it. Because we really don't understand until we do. The same type of mark up  like MathML  for chemistry. Imagine chemistry textbooks that actually understand the structure of how molecules are formed. Imagine Music XML that actually lets you delve into the semantic structure of music  play with it  understand it. It's no wonder that everybody's getting into it  right  Even the three wise men. OK  the second big enabler  and this is where I told a big lie. The second big enabler is intellectual property. Because  in fact  I got up here and I talked about how great the music culture is. We can share and rip  mix and burn  but in fact  that's all illegal. And we would be accused of  piracy  for doing that  because this music has been propertized. It's now owned  much of it by big industries. So  really  the key thing here is we can't let this happen. We can't let this Napster thing happen here. So  what we have to do is get it right from the very beginning. And what we have to do is find an intellectual property framework that makes sharing safe and makes it easily understandable. And the inspiration here is taken from open source software. Things like Linux and the GPL. The Creative Commons licenses. How many people have heard of creative commons  If you have not  you must learn about it. Creativecommons.org. At the bottom of every piece of material in Connexions and in lots of other projects  you can find their logo. Clicking on that logo takes you to an absolute no nonsense  human readable document  a deed  that tells you exactly what you can do with this content. In fact  you're free to share it  to do all of these things  to copy it  to change it  even to make commercial use of it  as long as you attribute the author. Because in academic publishing and much of educational publishing  it's really this idea of sharing knowledge and making impact. That's why people write  not necessarily making bucks. We're not talking about Harry Potter  right  We're at the long tail end here. Behind that is the legal code  very carefully constructed. And Creative Commons is taking off    over    million things out there  licensed with a Creative Commons license. Not just text  but music  images  video. And there's actually a tremendous uptake of the number of people that are actually licensing music to make it free for people who do this whole idea of re sampling  ripping  mixing  burning and sharing. OK  I'd like to conclude with just the last few points. So  we've built this idea of a commons. People are using it. We get over         unique visitors per month  just to our particular site. MIT OpenCourseWare  which is another large open content site  gets a similar number of hits. But how do we protect this  How do we protect it into the future  And the first thing that people are probably thinking is quality control  right  Because we're saying that anybody can contribute things to this commons. Anybody can contribute anything. So that could be a problem. It didn't take long until people started contributing materials  for example  on lingerie  which is actually a pretty good module. The only problem is it's plagiarized from a major French feminist journal  and when you go to the supposed course website  it points to a lingerie selling website. So this is a little bit of a problem. So we clearly need some kind of idea of quality control and this is really where the idea of review and peer review comes in. You come to TED. Why do you come to TED  Because Chris and his team have ensured that things are very  very high quality  right  And so we need to be able to do the same thing. And we need to be able to design structures  and what we're doing is designing social software to enable anyone to build their own peer review process  and we call these things  lenses.  And basically what they allow is anyone out there can develop their own peer review process  so that they can focus on the content in the repository that they think is really important. And you can think of TED as a potential lens. So I'd just like to end by saying  you can really view this as a call to action. Connexions and open content is all about sharing knowledge. All of you here are tremendously imbued with tremendous amounts of knowledge  and what I'd like to do is invite each and every one of you to contribute to this project and other projects of its type  because I think together we can truly change the landscape of education and educational publishing. So  thanks very much. Charles Van Doren  who was later a senior editor of Britannica  said the ideal encyclopedia should be radical    it should stop being safe. But if you know anything about the history of Britannica since       it was anything but radical  still a very completely safe  stodgy type of encyclopedia. Wikipedia  on the other hand  begins with a very radical idea  and that's for all of us to imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. And that's what we're doing. So Wikipedia    you just saw the little demonstration of it    it's a freely licensed encyclopedia. It's written by thousands of volunteers all over the world in many  many languages. It's written using wiki software    which is the type of software he just demonstrated    so anyone can quickly edit and save  and it goes live on the Internet immediately. And everything about Wikipedia is managed by virtually an all volunteer staff. So when Yochai is talking about new methods of organization  he's exactly describing Wikipedia. And what I'm going to do today is tell you a little bit more about how it really works on the inside. So Wikipedia's owned by the Wikimedia Foundation  which I founded  a nonprofit organization. And our goal  the core aim of the Wikimedia Foundation  is to get a free encyclopedia to every single person on the planet. And so  if you think about what that means  it means a lot more than just building a cool website. We're really interested in all the issues of the digital divide  poverty worldwide  empowering people everywhere to have the information that they need to make good decisions. And so we're going to have to do a lot of work that goes beyond just the Internet. And so that's a big part of why we've chosen the free licensing model  because that empowers local entrepreneurs or anyone who wants to    they can take our content and do anything they like with it    you can copy it  redistribute it    and you can do it commercially or non commercially. So there's a lot of opportunities that are going to arise around Wikipedia all over the world. We're funded by donations from the public  and one of the more interesting things about that is how little money it actually takes to run Wikipedia. So Yochai showed you the graph of what the cost of a printing press was. And I'm going to tell you what the cost of Wikipedia is. But first  I'll show you how big it is. So we've got over         articles in English. We've got two million total articles across many  many different languages. The biggest languages are German  Japanese  French    all the Western European languages are quite big. But only around one third of all of our traffic to our web clusters to the English Wikipedia  which is surprising to a lot of people. A lot of people think in a very English centric way on the Internet  but for us  we're truly global. We're in many  many languages. How popular we've gotten to be    we're a top    website and we're more popular than the New York Times. So this is where we get to Yochai's discussion. This shows the growth of Wikipedia    we're the blue line there    and this is the New York Times over there. And what's interesting about this is the New York Times website is a huge  enormous corporate operation with I have no idea how many hundreds of employees. We have exactly one employee  and that employee is our lead software developer. And he's only been our employee since January       all the other growth before that ... So the servers are managed by a ragtag band of volunteers. All the editing is done by volunteers. And the way that we're organized is not like any traditional organization you can imagine. People are always asking   Well  who's in charge of this   or  Who does that   And the answer is  anybody who wants to pitch in. It's a very unusual and chaotic thing. We've got over    servers now in three locations. These are managed by volunteer system administrators who are online. I can go online any time of the day or night and see eight to    people waiting for me to ask a question or something  anything about the servers. You could never afford to do this in a company. You could never afford to have a standby crew of people    hours a day and do what we're doing at Wikipedia. So we're doing around  .  billion page views monthly  so it's really gotten to be a huge thing. And everything is managed by the volunteers. And the total monthly cost for our bandwidth is about       dollars. And that's essentially our main cost. We could actually do without the employee. We hired Brian because he was working part time for two years and full time at Wikipedia  so we actually hired him  so he could get a life and go to the movies sometimes. So the big question when you've got this really chaotic organization is  why isn't it all rubbish  Why is the website as good as it is  First of all  how good is it  Well  it's pretty good. It isn't perfect  but it's much better than you would expect  given our completely chaotic model. So when you saw him make a ridiculous edit to the page about me  you think   Oh  this is obviously just going to degenerate into rubbish.  But when we've seen quality tests    and there haven't been enough of these yet and I'm really encouraging people to do more  comparing Wikipedia to traditional things    we win hands down. So a German magazine compared German Wikipedia  which is much  much smaller than English  to Microsoft Encarta and to Brockhaus multimedial  and we won across the board. They hired experts to come and look at articles and compare the quality  and we were very pleased with that result. So a lot of people have heard about the Wikipedia Bush Kerry controversy. The media has covered this somewhat extensively. It started out with an article in Red Herring. The reporters called me up and they    I mean  I have to say they spelled my name right  but they really wanted to say the Bush Kerry election is so contentious  it's tearing apart the Wikipedia community. And so they quote me as saying   They're the most contentious in the history of Wikipedia.  What I actually said is they're not contentious at all. So it's a slight misquote. The articles were edited quite heavily. And it is true that we did have to lock the articles on a couple of occasions. Time magazine recently reported that  Extreme action sometimes has to be taken  and Wales locked the entries on Kerry and Bush for most of     .  This came after I told the reporter that we had to lock it for    occasionally a little bit here and there. So the truth in general is that the kinds of controversies that you would probably think we have within the Wikipedia community are not really controversies at all. Articles on controversial topics are edited a lot  but they don't cause much controversy within the community. And the reason for this is that most people understand the need for neutrality. The real struggle is not between the right and the left    that's where most people assume    but it's between the party of the thoughtful and the party of the jerks. And no side of the political spectrum has a monopoly on either of those qualities. The actual truth about the specific Bush Kerry incident is that the Bush Kerry articles were locked less than one percent of the time in       and it wasn't because they were contentious  it was just because there was routine vandalism    which happens sometimes even on stage ... Sometimes even reporters have reported to me that they vandalized Wikipedia and were amazed that it was fixed so quickly. And I said    you know  I always say  please don't do that. That's not a good thing. So how do we do this  How do we manage the quality control  How does it work  So there's a few elements  mostly social policies and some elements of the software. So the biggest and the most important thing is our neutral point of view policy. This is something that I set down  from the very beginning  as a core principle of the community that's completely not debatable. It's a social concept of cooperation  so we don't talk a lot about truth and objectivity. The reason for this is if we say we're only going to write the  truth  about some topic  that doesn't do us a damn bit of good of figuring out what to write  because I don't agree with you about what's the truth. But we have this jargon term of neutrality  which has its own long history within the community  which basically says  any time there's a controversial issue  Wikipedia itself should not take a stand on the issue. We should merely report on what reputable parties have said about it. So this neutrality policy is really important for us because it empowers a community that is very diverse to come together and actually get some work done. So we have very diverse contributors in terms of political  religious  cultural backgrounds. By having this firm neutrality policy  which is non negotiable from the beginning  we ensure that people can work together and that the entries don't become simply a war back and forth between the left and the right. If you engage in that type of behavior  you'll be asked to leave the community. So  real time peer review. Every single change on the site goes to the  Recent changes  page. So as soon as he made his change  it went to the  Recent changes  page. That recent changes page was also fed into an IRC channel  which is an Internet chat channel that people are monitoring with various software tools. And people can get RSS feeds    they can get email notifications of changes. And then users can set up their own personal watch list. So my page is on quite a few volunteers' watch lists  because it is sometimes vandalized. And therefore  what happens is someone will notice the change very quickly  and then they'll just simply revert the change. There's a  new pages feed   for example  so you can go to a certain page of Wikipedia and see every new page as it's created. This is really important because a lot of new pages are just garbage that has to be deleted  you know   ASDFASDF.  But also  that's some of the most interesting and fun things  some of the new articles. People will start an article on some interesting topic  other people will find that intriguing and jump in and help and make it much better. So we do have edits by anonymous users  which is one of the most controversial and intriguing things about Wikipedia. So  Chris was able to do his change    he didn't have to log in or anything  he just went on the website and made a change. But it turns out that only about    percent of all the edits to the website are done by anonymous users. And that's a really important thing to understand  the vast majority of the edits that go on on the website are from a very close knit community of maybe     to       people who are in constant communication. And we have over    IRC channels     mailing lists. All these people know each other. They communicate. We have off line meetings. These are the people who are doing the bulk of the site  and they are  in a sense  semi professionals at what they're doing. The standards we set for ourselves are equal to or higher than professional standards of quality. We don't always meet those standards  but that's what we're striving for. And so that tight community is who really cares for the site  and these are some of the smartest people I've ever met. It's my job to say that  but it's actually true. The type of people who were drawn to writing an encyclopedia for fun tend to be pretty smart people. The tools and the software  there's lots of tools that allow us    allow us  meaning the community    to self monitor and to monitor all the work. This is an example of a page history on  flat Earth   and you can see some changes that were made. What's nice about this page is you can immediately take a look at this and see   OK  I understand now.  When somebody goes and looks at    they see that someone  an anonymous IP number  made an edit to my page. That sounds suspicious. Who is this person  Somebody looks at it    they can immediately see highlighted in red all of the changes that took place    to see  OK  well  these words have changed  things like this. So that's one tool that we can use to very quickly monitor the history of a page. Another thing that we do within the community is we leave everything very open ended. Most of the social rules and the methods of work are left completely open ended in the software. All of that stuff is just on Wiki pages. And so there's nothing in the software that enforces the rules. The example I've got up here is the Votes for Deletion page. So  I mentioned earlier  people type  ASDFASDF     it needs to be deleted. Cases like that  the administrators just delete it. There's no reason to have a big argument about it. But you can imagine there's a lot of other areas where the question is  is this notable enough to go in an encyclopedia  Is the information verifiable  Is it a hoax  Is it true  Is it what  So we needed a social method for figuring out the answer to this. And so the method that arose organically within the community is the Votes For Deletion page. And in the particular example we have here  it's a film   Twisted Issues   and the first person says   Now this is supposedly a film. It fails the Google test miserably.  The Google test is you look in Google and see if it's there  because if something's not even in Google  it probably doesn't exist at all. It's not a perfect rule  but it's a nice starting point for quick research. So somebody says   Delete it  please. Delete it    it's not notable.  And then somebody says   Wait  I found it. I found it in a book  'Film Threat Video Guide  the    Underground Films You Must See.'  So the next persons says   Clean it up.  Somebody says   I've found it on IMDB. Keep  keep  keep.  And what's interesting about this is that the software is    these votes are just text typed into a page. This is not really a vote so much as it is a dialogue. Now it is true that at the end of the day  an administrator can go through here and take a look at this and say   OK     deletes  two keeps  we'll delete it.  But in other cases  this could be    deletes and two keeps  and we would keep it  because if those last two keeps say   Wait a minute. Nobody else saw this but I found it in a book  and I found a link to a page that describes it  and I'm going to clean it up tomorrow  so please don't delete it   then it would survive. And it also matters who the people are who are voting. Like I say  it's a tight knit community. Down here at the bottom   Keep  real movie   RickK. RickK is a very famous Wikipedian who does an enormous amount of work with vandalism  hoaxes and votes for deletion. His voice carries a lot of weight within the community because he knows what he's doing. So how is all this governed  People really want to know about administrators  things like that. So the Wikipedia governance model  the governance of the community  is a very confusing  but workable mix of consensus    meaning we try not to vote on the content of articles  because the majority view is not necessarily neutral    some amount of democracy    all of the administrators    these are the people who have the ability to delete pages. That doesn't mean that they have the right to delete pages. They still have to follow all the rules    but they're elected by the community. Sometimes people    random trolls on the Internet    like to accuse me of handpicking the administrators to bias the content of the encyclopedia. I always laugh at this  because I have no idea how they're elected  actually. There's a certain amount of aristocracy. You got a hint of that when I mentioned  like  RickK's voice would carry a lot more weight than someone we don't know. I give this talk sometimes with Angela  who was just re elected to the board from the community    to the Board of the Foundation  with more than twice the votes of the person who didn't make it. And I always embarrass her because I say   Well  Angela  for example  could get away with doing absolutely anything within Wikipedia  because she's so admired and so powerful.  But the irony is  of course  that Angela can do this because she's the one person who you know would never  ever break any rules of Wikipedia. And I also like to say she's the only person who actually knows all the rules of Wikipedia  so ... And then there's monarchy  and that's my role on the community  so ... I was describing this in Berlin once  and the next day in the newspaper the headline said   I am the Queen of England.  And that's not exactly what I said  but    the point is my role in the community    Within the free software world  there's been a long standing tradition of the  benevolent dictator  model. So if you look at most of the major free software projects  they have one single person in charge who everyone agrees is the benevolent dictator. Well  I don't like the term  benevolent dictator   and I don't think that it's my job or my role in the world of ideas to be the dictator of the future of all human knowledge compiled by the world. It just isn't appropriate. But there is a need still for a certain amount of monarchy  a certain amount of    sometimes we have to make a decision and we don't want to get bogged down too heavily in formal decision making processes. So as an example of how this can be important  we recently had a situation where a neo Nazi website discovered Wikipedia  and they said   Oh  well  this is horrible  this Jewish conspiracy of a website  and we're going to get certain articles deleted that we don't like. And we see they have a voting process  so we're going to send    we have        members and we're going to send them over and they're all going to vote and get these pages deleted.  Well  they managed to get    people to show up. That's neo Nazi math for you. They always think they've got        members when they've got   . But they managed to get    people to come and vote in a fairly absurd way to delete a perfectly valid article. Of course  the vote ended up being about    to     so there was no real danger to our democratic processes. On the other hand  people said   But what are we going to do  I mean  this could happen. What if some group gets really seriously organized and comes in and wants to vote   Then I said   Well  fuck it  we'll just change the rules.  That's my job in the community  to say we won't allow our openness and freedom to undermine the quality of the content. And so  as long as people trust me in my role  then that's a valid place for me. Of course  because of the free licensing  if I do a bad job  the volunteers are more than happy to take and leave    I can't tell anyone what to do. So the final point here is that to understand how Wikipedia works  it's important to understand that our wiki model is the way we work  but we are not fanatical web anarchists. In fact  we're very flexible about the social methodology  because ultimately  the passion of the community is for the quality of the work  not necessarily for the process that we use to generate it. Thank you. Ben Saunders  Yeah  hi  Ben Saunders. Jimmy  you mentioned impartiality being a key to Wikipedia's success. It strikes me that much of the textbooks that are used to educate our children are inherently biased. Have you found Wikipedia being used by teachers and how do you see Wikipedia changing education  Jimmy Wales  Yeah  so  a lot of teachers are beginning to use Wikipedia. There's a media storyline about Wikipedia  which I think is false. It builds on the storyline of bloggers versus newspapers. And the storyline is  there's this crazy thing  Wikipedia  but academics hate it and teachers hate it. And that turns out to not be true. The last time I got an email from a journalist saying   Why do academics hate Wikipedia   I sent it from my Harvard email address because I was recently appointed a fellow there. And I said   Well  they don't all hate it.  But I think there's going to be huge impacts. And we actually have a project that I'm personally really excited about  which is the Wikibooks project  which is an effort to create textbooks in all the languages. And that's a much bigger project. It's going to take    years or so to come to fruition. But part of that is to fulfill our mission of giving an encyclopedia to every single person on the planet. We don't mean we're going to Spam them with AOL style CDs. We mean we're going to give them a tool that they can use. And for a lot of people in the world  if I give you an encyclopedia that's written at a university level  it doesn't do you any good without a whole host of literacy materials to build you up to the point where you can actually use it. The Wikibooks project is an effort to do that. And I think that we're going to see    it may not even come from us  there's all kinds of innovation going on. But freely licensed textbooks are the next big thing in education. Over the past couple of days  as I've been preparing for my speech  I've become more and more nervous about what I'm going to say and about being on the same stage as all these fascinating people. Being on the same stage as Al Gore  who was the first person I ever voted for. And    So I was getting pretty nervous and  you know  I didn't know that Chris sits on the stage  and that's more nerve racking. But then I started thinking about my family. I started thinking about my father and my grandfather and my great grandfather  and I realized that I had all of these Teds going through my bloodstream    that I had to consider this  my element.  So  who am I  Chris kind of mentioned I started a company with my husband. We have about     people internationally. If you looked in the book  you saw this ... which I really was appalled by. And because I wanted to impress you all with slides  since I saw the great presentations yesterday with graphs  I made a graph that moves  and I talk about the makeup of me. So  besides this freakish thing  this is my science slide. This is math  and this is science  this is genetics. This is my grandmother  and this is where I get this mouth. So    I'm a blogger  which  probably  to a lot of you  means different things. You may have heard about the Kryptonite lock brouhaha  where a blogger talked about how you hack or break into a Kryptonite lock using a ballpoint pen  and it spread all over. Kryptonite had to adjust the lock  and they had to address it to avoid too many customer concerns. You may have heard about Rathergate  which was basically the result of bloggers realizing that the  th  in     is not typeset on an old typewriter  it's on Word. Bloggers exposed this  or they worked hard to expose this. You know  blogs are scary. This is what you see. I see this  and I'm sure scared    I swear on stage    shitless about blogs  because this is not something that's friendly. But there are blogs that are changing the way we read news and consume media  and these are great examples. These people are reaching thousands  if not millions  of readers  and that's incredibly important. During the hurricane  you had MSNBC posting about the hurricane on their blog  updating it frequently. This was possible because of the easy nature of blogging tools. You have my friend  who has a blog on PVRs  personal recorders. He makes enough money just by running ads  to support his family up in Oregon. That's all he does now  and this is something that blogs have made possible. And then you have something like this  which is Interplast. It's a wonderful organization of people and doctors who go to developing nations to offer plastic surgery to those who need it. Children with cleft palates get it  and they document their story. This is wonderful. I am not that caring. I talk about myself. That's what I am. I'm a blogger. I have always decided that I was going to be an expert on one thing  and I am an expert on this person  and so I write about it. So  the short story about my blog  it started in       I was   . I wasn't happy with my job  because I was a designer  but I wasn't being really stimulated. I was an English major in college. I didn't have any use for it  but I missed writing. So  I started to write a blog and I started to create things like these little stories. This was an illustration about my camp experience when I was    years old  and how I went to a YMCA camp  Christian camp  and basically by the end  I had made my friends hate me so much that I hid in a bunk  They couldn't find me  they sent a search party  and I overheard people saying they wish I had killed myself    jumped off Bible Peak. You can laugh  this is OK. This is me. This is what happened to me. And when I started my blog  it was really this one goal    I said   I am not going to be famous to the world  but I could be famous to people on the Internet.  And I set a goal. I said   I'm going to win an award   because I had never won an award in my entire life. And I said   I'm going to win the South by Southwest Weblog award.  And I won it    I reached all of these people  and I had tens of thousands of people reading about my life every day. And then I wrote a post about a banjo. I wrote a post about wanting to buy a banjo    a      banjo  which is a lot of money. And I don't play instruments  I don't know anything about music. I like music  and I like banjos  and I think I probably heard Steve Martin playing  and I said   I could do that.  And I said to my husband   Ben  can I buy a banjo   And he's like   No.  And my husband    this is my husband  who is very hot    he won an award for being hot. He told me   You cannot buy a banjo. You're just like your dad   who collects instruments. And I wrote a post about how I was so mad at him  he was such a tyrant    he would not let me buy this banjo. And those people who know me understood my joke    this is Mena  this is how I make a joke at people. Because the joke in this is that this person is not a tyrant  this person is so loving and so sweet that he lets me dress him up and post pictures of him to my blog. And if he knew I was showing this right now    I put this in today    he would kill me. But the thing was  my friends read it  and they're like   Oh  that Mena  she wrote a post about wanting a stupid thing and being stupid.  But I got emails from people that said   Oh my God  your husband is such an asshole. How much money does he spend on beer in a year  You could take that money and buy your banjo. Why don't you open a separate account   I've been with him since I was     we've never had a separate bank account. They said   Separate your bank account. Spend your money  spend his money  that's it.  And then I got people saying   Leave him.  I was like   OK  what  Who are these people  And why are they reading this   And I realized  I don't want to reach these people. I don't want to write for this public audience. And I started to kill my blog slowly. I'm like  I don't want to write this anymore. Slowly and slowly    And I did tell personal stories from time to time. I wrote this one  and I put this up because of Einstein today. I'm going to get choked up  because this is my first pet  and she passed away two years ago. And I decided to break from   I don't really write about my public life   because I wanted to give her a little memorial. But anyways  it's these sorts of personal stories    You know  you read the blogs about politics or about media  and gossip and all these things. These are out there  but it's more of the personal that interests me  and this is who I am. You see Norman Rockwell  and you have art critics say   Norman Rockwell is not art. Norman Rockwell hangs in living rooms and bathrooms  and this is not something to be considered high art.  And I think this is one of the most important things to us as humans. These things resonate with us  and  if you think about blogs  you think of high art blogs  the history paintings about  you know  all the biblical stories  and then you have this. These are the blogs that interest me  the people that just tell stories. One story is about this baby  and his name is Odin. His father was a blogger. And he was writing his blog one day  and his wife gave birth to her baby at    weeks. And he never expected this. One day  it was normal  the next day  it was hell. And this is a one pound baby. So Odin was documented every single day. Pictures were taken every day  day one  day two ... You have day nine    they're talking about his apnea  day       he gets pneumonia. His baby is so small  and I've never encountered such a    just    a disturbing image  but just so heartfelt. And you're reading this as it happens  so on day     everybody reads that he's having failures  breathing failures and heart failures  and it's slowing down  and you don't know what to expect. But then it gets better. Day     he goes home. And you see this post. That's not something you're going to see in a paper or magazine but this is something this person feels  and people are excited about it       comments. That's not a huge amount of people reading  but    people matter. And today  he is a healthy baby  who  if you read his blog    it's snowdeal.org  his father's blog    he is taking pictures of him still  because he is still his son and he is  I think  at his age level right now because he had received such great treatment from the hospital. So  blogs. So what  You've probably heard these things before. We talked about the WELL  and about all these sorts of things throughout our online history. But I think blogs are basically just an evolution  and that's where we are today. It's this record of who you are  your persona. You have your Google search  where you say   What is Mena Trott   And then you find these things and you're happy or unhappy. But then you also find people's blogs  and those are the records of people that are writing daily    not necessarily about the same topic  but things that interest them. And we talk about the world flattens  being in this panel  and I am very optimistic    whenever I think about blogs  I'm like   We've got to reach all these people.  Hundreds of millions and billions of people. We're getting into China  we want to be there  but there are so many people that won't have the access to write a blog. But to see something like the      computer is amazing  because blogging software is simple. We have a successful company because of timing  and because of perseverance  but it's simple stuff    it's not rocket science. And so  that's an amazing thing to consider. So    the life record of a blog is something that I find incredibly important. And we started with a slide of my Teds  and I had to add this slide  because I knew the minute I showed this  my mom    my mom will see this  because she does read my blog and she'll say   Why wasn't there a picture of me   This is my mom. So  I have all the people that I know of. But this is basically the extent of the family that I know in terms of my direct line. I showed a Norman Rockwell painting before  and this one  I grew up with  looking at constantly. I would spend hours looking at the connections  saying   Oh  the little kid up at the top has red hair  so does that first generation up there.  And it's just these little things. This is not science  but this was enough for me to be really interested in how we have evolved and how we can trace our line. So that has always influenced me. I have this record  this      census  of another Grabowski    that's my maiden name    and there's a Theodore  because there's always a Theodore. This is all I have  a couple of facts about somebody. I have their date of birth  their age  what they did in their household  if they spoke English  and that's it  that's all I know of these people. And it's pretty sad  because I only go back five generations  and that's it. I don't even know what happens on my mom's side  because she's from Cuba and I don't have that many things. Just doing this  I spent time in the archives    that's why my husband's a saint    I spent time in the Washington archives  just sitting there  looking for these things. Now it's online  but he sat through that. And so you have this record and    This is my great great grandmother. This is the only picture I have. And to think of what we have the ability to do with our blogs  to think about the people that are on those      computers  talking about who they are  sharing these personal stories    this is an amazing thing. Another photo that has greatly influenced me  or a series of photos  is this project that's done by an Argentinean man and his wife. And he's basically taking a picture of his family every day for the past  what is '          ... Oh my God  I'm '         years  Twenty nine years. There was a joke  originally  about my graph that I left out  which is  You see all this math  I'm just happy I was able to add it up to      because that's my skill set. So you have these people aging  and now this is them today  or last year. And that's a powerful thing to have  to be able to track this. I wish that I would have this of my family. I know that one day my children will be wondering    or my grandchildren  or my great grandchildren  if I ever have children    what I am going to    who I was. So I do something that's very narcissistic    I am a blogger    that is an amazing thing for me  because it captures a moment in time every day. I take a picture of myself    I've been doing this since last year    every single day. And  you know  it's the same picture  it's basically the same person. Only a couple of people read it. I don't write this for this audience  I'm showing it now  but I would go insane if this was really public. About four people probably read it  and they tell me   You haven't updated.  I'm probably going to get people telling me I haven't updated. But this is amazing  because I can go back to a day    to April       and say  what was I doing this day  I look at it  I know exactly. It's this visual cue that is so important to what we do. I put the bad pictures up too  because there are bad pictures. And I remember instantly  I am in Germany in this    I had to go for a one day trip. I was sick  and I was in a hotel room  and I wanted not to be there. And so you see these things  it's not just always smiling. Now I've kind of evolved it  so I have this look. If you look at my driver's license  I have the same look  and it's a pretty disturbing thing  but it's something that is really important. And the last story I really want to tell is this story  because this is probably the one that means the most to me in all of what I'm doing. I'll probably get choked up  because I tend to when I talk about this. So  this woman  her name was Emma  and she was a blogger on our service  TypePad. And she was a beta tester  so she was there right when we opened    you know  there was     people. And she wrote about her life dealing with cancer. She was writing and writing  and we all started reading it  because we had so few blogs on the service  we could keep track of everyone. And she was writing one day  and then she disappeared for a little bit. And her sister came on  and she said that Emma had passed away. And all of our support staff who had talked to her were really emotional  and it was a very hard day at the company. And this was one of those instances where I realized how much blogging affects our relationship  and flattening this sort of world. That this woman is in England  and she lives    she lived    a life where she was talking about what she was doing. But the big thing that really influenced us was  her sister wrote to me  and she said    and she wrote on this blog    that writing her blog during the last couple of months of her life was probably the best thing that had happened to her  and being able to talk to people and to share what was going on  and being able to write and receive comments. And that was amazing  to be able to know that we had empowered that  and that blogging was something that she felt comfortable doing  and the idea that blogging doesn't have to be scary  that we don't always have to be attack of the blogs  that we can be people who are open  and wanting to help and talk to people. That was an amazing thing. And so I printed out and sent a PDF of her blog to her family  and they passed it out at her memorial service  and even in her obituary  they mentioned her blog  because it was such a big part of her life. And that's a huge thing. So  this is her legacy  and I think that my call to action to all of you is  think about blogs  think about what they are  think about what you've thought of them  and then actually do it  because it's something that's really going to change our lives. So  thank you. You know  when Chris first approached me to speak at TED  I said no  because I felt like I wasn't going to be able to make that personal connection  you know  that I wanted to. It's such a large conference. But he explained to me that he was in a bind  and that he was having trouble finding the kind of sex appeal and star power that the conference was known for. So I said fine  Ted    I mean Chris. I'll come on two conditions. One  I want to speak as early in the morning as possible. And two  I want to pick the theme for TED     . And luckily he agreed. And the theme  in two years  is going to be  Cute Pictures Of Puppies.   How to Dance Properly BASIC TWIRL   NEW SCHOOL   OLD SCHOOL   WHO'S YOUR DADDY     RIDE THE PONY    MAKE LOVE TO THE CROWD   SMACKING THAT ASS   STIR THE POT OF LOVE   HANGING OUT ... CASUAL   WORD.  I invented the Placebo Camera. It doesn't actually take pictures  but it's a hell of a lot cheaper  and you still feel like you were there.  Dear Sir  good day  compliments of the day  and my best wishes to you and family. I know this letter will come to you surprisingly  but let it not be a surprise to you  for nature has a way of arriving unannounced  and  as an adage says  originals are very hard to find  but their echoes sound ouder. So I decided to contact you myself  for you to assure me of safety and honesty  if I have to entrust any amount of money under your custody. I am Mr Micheal Bangura  the son of late Mr Thaimu Bangura who was the Minister of Finance in Sierra Leone but was killed during the civil war. Knowing your country to be economical conducive for investment  and your people as transparent and trustworthy to engage in business  on which premise I write you. Before my father death  he had the sum of    million United States dollars  which he kept away from the rebel leaders during the course of the war. This fund was supposed to be used for the rehabilitation of water reserves all over the country  before the outbreak of war. When the war broke out  the rebel leader demanded the fund be given to him  my father insisted it was not in his possession  and he was killed because of his refusal to release the fund. Meanwhile  my mother and I is the only person who knows about it because my father always confide in me. I made an arrangement with a Red Cross relief worker  who used his official van to transport the money to Lungi Airport  Freetown  although he did not know the real contents of the box. The fund was deposited as a family reasure  in a safe  reliable security company in Dakar  Senegal  where I was only given temporary asylum. I do not wish to invest the money in Senegal due to unfavorable economic climate  and so close to my country. The only assistance I need from you  which I know you would do for me  are the following  one  be a silent partner and receive the funds in your account in trust  two  provide a bank account under your control to which the funds will be remitted  three  receive the funds into your account in trust  take out your commission  and leave the rest of the money until I arrive  after the transfer is complete. Sincerely  Mr Micheal Bangura.  This is really embarrassing. I was told backstage that I have    minutes. I only prepared   . So if it's cool  I'd like to just wait for three. I'm really sorry. What's your name  Mark Surfas. It's pretty cool  huh  Pursuing happiness. Are you a virgin  Virgin  I mean    no  I mean like in the TED sense  Are you  Oh  yeah  So what are you  like  a thousand  two thousand  somewhere in there  Huh  Oh  You don't know what I'm talking about  Ah  Mark    Surfas.          am I good  And that's nothing to be ashamed of. That's nothing to be ashamed of. Yeah  I was hanging out with some Google guys last night. Really cool  we were getting wasted. And they were telling me that Google software has gotten so advanced that  based on your interaction with Google over your lifetime  they can actually predict what you are going to say    next. And I was like   Get the fuck out of here. That's crazy.  But they said   No  but don't show anyone.  But they slipped up. And they said that I could just type in  What was I going to say next   and my name  and it would tell me. And I have to tell you  this is an unadulterated piece of software  this is a real Internet browser and this is the actual Google site  and we're going to test it out live today. What was I going to say next  And  Ze Frank     that's me. Am I feeling lucky  Audience  Yes  Yeah  Ze Frank  Oh  Amazing. In March of         I filmed myself dancing to Madonna's  Justify My Love.  On a Thursday  I sent out a link to a website that featured those clips to    of my closest friends  as part of an invitation to my    an invitation to my th    th      th birthday party. By Monday  over a million people were coming to this site a day. Within a week  I received a call from Earthlink that said  due to a    cents per megabyte overage charge  I owed them        dollars. Needless to say  I was able to leave my job.  WAS LAID OFF  And  finally  you know  become freelance.  UNEMPLOYED  But some people refer to me more as  like  an Internet guru or     JACKASS  swami. I knew I had something. I'd basically distilled a very difficult to explain and complex philosophy  which I won't get into here  because it's a little too deep for all of you  but    It's about what makes websites popular  and  you know  it's     DANCE LIKE AN IDIOT AND DON'T SELL ANYTHING  It's unfortunate that I don't have more time. Maybe I can come back next year  or something like that. I'm obsessed with email. I get a lot of it. Four years later  I still get probably two or three hundred emails a day from people I don't know  and it's been an amazing opportunity to kind of get to know different cultures  you know  It's like a microscope to the rest of the world. You can kind of peer into other people's lives. And I also feel like I get a lot of inspiration from the average user. For example  somebody wrote   Hey Ze  if you ever come to Boulder  you should rock out with us   and I said   Why wait    rocking out  And they said   Hey Ze  thanks for rocking out  but I meant the kind of rocking out where we'd be naked.  And that was embarrassing. But you know  it's kind of a collaboration between me and the fans  so I said   Sure.   rocking out naked  I hear a lot of you whispering. And I know what you're saying   Holy crap  How is his presentation so smooth   And I have to say that it's not all me this year. I guess Chris has to take some credit here  because in years past  I guess there's been some sort of subpar speakers at TED. I don't know. And so  this year  Chris sent us a TED conference simulator. Which really allowed us as speakers to get there  in the trenches  and practice at home so that we would be ready for this experience. And I've got to say that  you know  it's really  really great to be here. I'd like to tell all of you a little joke. Not just the good stuff  though. You can do heckler mode. Voice  Hey  moron  get off the stage  ZF  You get off the stage. Voice  We want Malcolm Gladwell. In case you run over time. Just one last thing I'd like to say  I'd  really    I'd like to thank all of you for being here. And frog mode.  Spam jokes are the new airplane jokes  It's true. Some people say to me   Ze  you're doing all this stuff  this Internet stuff  and you're not making any money.   Why   And I say   Mom  Dad    I'm trying.  I don't know if you're all aware of this  but the video game market  kids are playing these video games  but  supposedly  there's tons of money. I mean  like  I think          dollars or so a year is being spent on these things. So I decided to try my hand. I came up with a few games. This is called  Atheist.  I figured it would be popular with the young kids. OK. Look  I'll move around and say some things.  Game over. There is no replay.  So that didn't go over so well. I don't really understand why you're laughing. Should have done this before I tried to pitch it.  Buddhist   of course  looks very  very similar to  Atheist.  But you come back as a duck. And this is great because  you know  for a quarter  you can play this for a long time. And Chris had said in an email that we should really bring something new to TED  something that we haven't shown anyone. So  I made this for TED. It's  Christian.  It's the third in the series. I'm hoping it's going to do well this year. Do you have a preference  Good choice. So you can wait for the Second Coming  which is a random number between one and     million. So really  what are we talking about here  Oh  tech joy. Tech joy  to me  means something  because I get a lot of joy out of tech. And in fact  making things using technology    and I'm being serious here  even though I'm using my sarcastic voice    I won't    hold on. Making things  you know    making things actually does give me a lot of joy. It's the process of creation that keeps me sort of a bubble and a half above perpetual anxiety in my life  and it's that feeling of being about    percent complete on a project    where you know you still have something to do  but it's not finished  and you're not starting something    that really fills my entire life. And so  what I've done is  I started getting interested in creating online social spaces to share that feeling with people who don't consider themselves artists. We're in a culture of guru ship. It's so hard to use some software because  you know  it's unapproachable  people feel like they have to read the manual. So I try to create these very minimal activities that allow people to express themselves  and  hopefully    Whoa  I'm like    on the page  but it doesn't exist. It's  like    seriously  though    I try to create meaningful environments for people to express themselves. Here I created a contest called   When Office Supplies Attack   which  I think  really resonated with the working population. Over     entries in three weeks. Toilet paper fashion. Again  people from all over the country. The watch is particularly incredible. Online drawing tools    you've probably seen a lot of them. I think they're wonderful. It's a chance for people to get to play with crayons and all that kind of stuff. But I'm interested in the process of creating  as the real event that I'm interested in. And the problem is that a lot of people suck at drawing  and they get bummed out at this  sort of  you know  stick figure  awful little thing that they created. And eventually  it just makes them stop playing with it  or they draw penises and things like that. So  the Scribbler is an attempt to create a generative tool. In other words  it's a helping tool. You can draw your simple stick figure  and it collaborates with you to create sort of a post war German etching. In fact  it's tuned to be better at drawing things that look worse. So  we go ahead  and we start scribbling. So the idea is that you can really  you know  partake in this process  but watch something really crappy look beautiful. And here are some of my favorites. This is the little trap marionette that was submitted to me. Very cool. Darling. Beautiful stuff. I mean this is incredible. An    year old girl drew this and submitted it. It's just gorgeous. I'm dead serious here. This is not a joke. But  I think it's a really fun and wonderful thing. So this is called the  Fiction Project.  This is an online space  which is basically a refurbished message board that encourages collaborative fiction writing. These are haikus. None of the haikus were written by the same person. In fact  each line is contributed by a different person at a different time. I think that the  now tied up  tied down  mistress cruel approaches me  now tied down  it's up.  It's an amazing way  and I'll tell you  if you come home  and your spouse  or whoever it is  says   Let's talk     That  like  chills you to the very core. But it's peripheral activities like these that allow people to get together  doing fun things. They actually get to know each other  and it's sort of like low threshold peripheral activities that I think are the key to bringing up some of our bonding social capital that we're lacking. And very  very quickly    I love puppets. Here's a puppet. It dances to music. Lotte Reiniger  an amazing shadow puppeteer in the   s  that started doing more elaborate things. I became interested in puppets  and I just want to show one last thing to you. Oh  this is how you make puppets. Chris Anderson  Ladies and gentlemen  Mr. Ze Frank. I'd like to talk today about the two biggest social trends in the coming century  and perhaps in the next        years. But I want to start with my work on romantic love  because that's my most recent work. What I and my colleagues did was put    people  who were madly in love  into a functional MRI brain scanner.    who were madly in love and their love was accepted  and    who were madly in love and they had just been dumped. And so I want to tell you about that first  and then go on into where I think love is going.  What 'tis to love   Shakespeare said. I think our ancestors    I think human beings have been wondering about this question since they sat around their campfires or lay and watched the stars a million years ago. I started out by trying to figure out what romantic love was by looking at the last    years of the psychological research and as it turns out  there's a very specific group of things that happen when you fall in love. The first thing that happens is  a person begins to take on what I call   special meaning.  As a truck driver once said to me   The world had a new center  and that center was Mary Anne.  George Bernard Shaw said it differently.  Love consists of overestimating the differences between one woman and another.  And indeed  that's what we do. And then you just focus on this person. You can list what you don't like about them  but then you sweep that aside and focus on what you do. As Chaucer said   Love is blind.  In trying to understand romantic love  I decided I would read poetry from all over the world  and I just want to give you one very short poem from eighth century China  because it's an almost perfect example of a man who is focused totally on a particular woman. It's a little bit like when you are madly in love with somebody and you walk into a parking lot    their car is different from every other car in the parking lot. Their wine glass at dinner is different from every other wine glass at the dinner party. And in this case  a man got hooked on a bamboo sleeping mat. And it goes like this. It's by a guy called Yuan Zhen.  I cannot bear to put away the bamboo sleeping mat. The night I brought you home  I watched you roll it out.  He became hooked on a sleeping mat  probably because of elevated activity of dopamine in his brain  just like with you and me. But anyway  not only does this person take on special meaning  you focus your attention on them. You aggrandize them. But you have intense energy. As one Polynesian said   I felt like jumping in the sky.  You're up all night. You're walking till dawn. You feel intense elation when things are going well  mood swings into horrible despair when things are going poorly. Real dependence on this person. As one businessman in New York said to me   Anything she liked  I liked.  Simple. Romantic love is very simple. You become extremely sexually possessive. You know  if you're just sleeping with somebody casually  you don't really care if they're sleeping with somebody else. But the moment you fall in love  you become extremely sexually possessive of them. I think there's a Darwinian purpose to this. The whole point of this is to pull two people together strongly enough to begin to rear babies as a team. But the main characteristics of romantic love are craving  an intense craving to be with a particular person  not just sexually  but emotionally. It would be nice to go to bed with them  but you want them to call you on the telephone  to invite you out  etc.  to tell you that they love you. The other main characteristic is motivation. The motor in the brain begins to crank  and you want this person. And last but not least  it is an obsession. Before I put these people in the MRI machine  I would ask them all kinds of questions. But my most important question was always the same. It was   What percentage of the day and night do you think about this person   And indeed  they would say   All day. All night. I can never stop thinking about him or her.  And then  the very last question    I would always have to work myself up to this question  because I'm not a psychologist. I don't work with people in any kind of traumatic situation. My final question was always the same. I would say   Would you die for him or her   And  indeed  these people would say  Yes   as if I had asked them to pass the salt. I was just staggered by it. So we scanned their brains  looking at a photograph of their sweetheart and looking at a neutral photograph  with a distraction task in between. So we could look at the same brain when it was in that heightened state and when it was in a resting state. And we found activity in a lot of brain regions. In fact  one of the most important was a brain region that becomes active when you feel the rush of cocaine. And indeed  that's exactly what happens. I began to realize that romantic love is not an emotion. In fact  I had always thought it was a series of emotions  from very high to very low. But actually  it's a drive. It comes from the motor of the mind  the wanting part of the mind  the craving part of the mind. The kind of part of the mind when you're reaching for that piece of chocolate  when you want to win that promotion at work. The motor of the brain. It's a drive. And in fact  I think it's more powerful than the sex drive. You know  if you ask somebody to go to bed with you  and they say   No  thank you   you certainly don't kill yourself or slip into a clinical depression. But certainly  around the world  people who are rejected in love will kill for it. People live for love. They kill for love. They die for love. They have songs  poems  novels  sculptures  paintings  myths  legends. In over     societies  people have left their evidence of this powerful brain system. I have come to think it's one of the most powerful brain systems on Earth for both great joy and great sorrow. And I've also come to think that it's one of three basically different brain systems that evolved from mating and reproduction. One is the sex drive  the craving for sexual gratification. W.H. Auden called it an  intolerable neural itch   and indeed  that's what it is. It keeps bothering you a little bit  like being hungry. The second of these three brain systems is romantic love  that elation  obsession of early love. And the third brain system is attachment  that sense of calm and security you can feel for a long term partner. And I think that the sex drive evolved to get you out there  looking for a whole range of partners. You can feel it when you're just driving along in your car. It can be focused on nobody. I think romantic love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time  thereby conserving mating time and energy. And I think that attachment  the third brain system  evolved to enable you to tolerate this human being at least long enough to raise a child together as a team. So with that preamble  I want to go into discussing the two most profound social trends. One of the last        years and the other  certainly of the last    years  that are going to have an impact on these three different brain systems  lust  romantic love and deep attachment to a partner. The first is women working  moving into the workforce. I've looked at     societies through the demographic yearbooks of the United Nations. Everywhere in the world      out of     of them  women are not only moving into the job market    sometimes very  very slowly  but they are moving into the job market    and they are very slowly closing that gap between men and women in terms of economic power  health and education. It's very slow. For every trend on this planet  there's a counter trend. We all know of them  but nevertheless    the Arabs say   The dogs may bark  but the caravan moves on.  And  indeed  that caravan is moving on. Women are moving back into the job market. And I say back into the job market  because this is not new. For millions of years  on the grasslands of Africa  women commuted to work to gather their vegetables. They came home with    to    percent of the evening meal. The double income family was the standard. And women were regarded as just as economically  socially and sexually powerful as men. In short  we're really moving forward to the past. Then  women's worst invention was the plow. With the beginning of plow agriculture  men's roles became extremely powerful. Women lost their ancient jobs as collectors  but then with the industrial revolution and the post industrial revolution they're moving back into the job market. In short  they are acquiring the status that they had a million years ago         years ago          years ago. We are seeing now one of the most remarkable traditions in the history of the human animal. And it's going to have an impact. I generally give a whole lecture on the impact of women on the business community. I'll say just a couple of things  and then go on to sex and love. There's a lot of gender differences  anybody who thinks men and women are alike simply never had a boy and a girl child. I don't know why they want to think that men and women are alike. There's much we have in common  but there's a whole lot that we do not have in common. We are    in the words of Ted Hughes   I think that we are like two feet. We need each other to get ahead.  But we did not evolve to have the same brain. And we're finding more and more gender differences in the brain. I'll only just use a couple and then move on to sex and love. One of them is women's verbal ability. Women can talk. Women's ability to find the right word rapidly  basic articulation goes up in the middle of the menstrual cycle  when estrogen levels peak. But even at menstruation  they're better than the average man. Women can talk. They've been doing it for a million years  words were women's tools. They held that baby in front of their face  cajoling it  reprimanding it  educating it with words. And  indeed  they're becoming a very powerful force. Even in places like India and Japan  where women are not moving rapidly into the regular job market  they're moving into journalism. And I think that the television is like the global campfire. We sit around it and it shapes our minds. Almost always  when I'm on TV  the producer who calls me  who negotiates what we're going to say  is a woman. In fact  Solzhenitsyn once said   To have a great writer is to have another government.  Today    percent of people who are writers in America are women. It's one of many  many characteristics that women have that they will bring into the job market. They've got incredible people skills  negotiating skills. They're highly imaginative. We now know the brain circuitry of imagination  of long term planning. They tend to be web thinkers. Because the female parts of the brain are better connected  they tend to collect more pieces of data when they think  put them into more complex patterns  see more options and outcomes. They tend to be contextual  holistic thinkers  what I call web thinkers. Men tend to    and these are averages    tend to get rid of what they regard as extraneous  focus on what they do  and move in a more step by step thinking pattern. They're both perfectly good ways of thinking. We need both of them to get ahead. In fact  there's many more male geniuses in the world. And there's also many more male idiots in the world. When the male brain works well  it works extremely well. And what I really think that we're doing is  we're moving towards a collaborative society  a society in which the talents of both men and women are becoming understood and valued and employed. But in fact  women moving into the job market is having a huge impact on sex and romance and family life. Foremost  women are starting to express their sexuality. I'm always astonished when people come to me and say   Why is it that men are so adulterous    Why do you think more men are adulterous than women    Well  men are more adulterous   And I say   Who do you think these men are sleeping with   And    basic math  Anyway. In the Western world  women start sooner at sex  have more partners  express less remorse for the partners that they do  marry later  have fewer children  leave bad marriages in order to get good ones. We are seeing the rise of female sexual expression. And  indeed  once again we're moving forward to the kind of sexual expression that we probably saw on the grasslands of Africa a million years ago  because this is the kind of sexual expression that we see in hunting and gathering societies today. We're also returning to an ancient form of marriage equality. They're now saying that the   st century is going to be the century of what they call the  symmetrical marriage   or the  pure marriage   or the  companionate marriage.  This is a marriage between equals  moving forward to a pattern that is highly compatible with the ancient human spirit. We're also seeing a rise of romantic love.    percent of American women and    percent of American men would not marry somebody who had every single quality they were looking for in a partner  if they were not in love with that person. People around the world  in a study of    societies  want to be in love with the person that they marry. Indeed  arranged marriages are on their way off this braid of human life. I even think that marriages might even become more stable because of the second great world trend. The first one being women moving into the job market  the second one being the aging world population. They're now saying that in America  that middle age should be regarded as up to age   . Because in that highest age category of    to     as much as    percent of people have nothing really wrong with them. So we're seeing there's a real extension of middle age. For one of my books  I looked at divorce data in    societies. And as it turns out  the older you get  the less likely you are to divorce. So the divorce rate right now is stable in America  and it's actually beginning to decline. It may decline some more. I would even say that with Viagra  estrogen replacement  hip replacements and the incredibly interesting women    women have never been as interesting as they are now. Not at any time on this planet have women been so educated  so interesting  so capable. And so I honestly think that if there really was ever a time in human evolution when we have the opportunity to make good marriages  that time is now. However  there's always kinds of complications in this. These three brain systems    lust  romantic love and attachment    don't always go together. They can go together  by the way. That's why casual sex isn't so casual. With orgasm you get a spike of dopamine. Dopamine's associated with romantic love  and you can just fall in love with somebody who you're just having casual sex with. With orgasm  then you get a real rush of oxytocin and vasopressin    those are associated with attachment. This is why you can feel such a sense of cosmic union with somebody after you've made love to them. But these three brain systems  lust  romantic love and attachment  aren't always connected to each other. You can feel deep attachment to a long term partner while you feel intense romantic love for somebody else  while you feel the sex drive for people unrelated to these other partners. In short  we're capable of loving more than one person at a time. In fact  you can lie in bed at night and swing from deep feelings of attachment for one person to deep feelings of romantic love for somebody else. It's as if there's a committee meeting going on in your head as you are trying to decide what to do. So I don't think  honestly  we're an animal that was built to be happy  we are an animal that was built to reproduce. I think the happiness we find  we make. And I think  however  we can make good relationships with each other. So I want to conclude with two things. I want to conclude with a worry  and with a wonderful story. The worry is about antidepressants. Over     million prescriptions of antidepressants are written every year in the United States. And these drugs are going generic. They are seeping around the world. I know one girl who's been on these antidepressants  SSRIs  serotonin enhancing antidepressants    since she was   . She's   . She's been on them ever since she was   . I've got nothing against people who take them short term  when they're going through something horrible. They want to commit suicide or kill somebody else. I would recommend it. But more and more people in the United States are taking them long term. And indeed  what these drugs do is raise levels of serotonin. And by raising levels of serotonin  you suppress the dopamine circuit. Everybody knows that. Dopamine is associated with romantic love. Not only do they suppress the dopamine circuit  but they kill the sex drive. And when you kill the sex drive  you kill orgasm. And when you kill orgasm  you kill that flood of drugs associated with attachment. The things are connected in the brain. And when you tamper with one brain system  you're going to tamper with another. I'm just simply saying that a world without love is a deadly place. So now    Thank you. I want to end with a story. And then  just a comment. I've been studying romantic love and sex and attachment for    years. I'm an identical twin  I am interested in why we're all alike. Why you and I are alike  why the Iraqis and the Japanese and the Australian Aborigines and the people of the Amazon River are all alike. And about a year ago  an Internet dating service  Match.com  came to me and asked me if I would design a new dating site for them. I said   I don't know anything about personality. You know  I don't know. Do you think you've got the right person   They said   Yes.  It got me thinking about why it is that you fall in love with one person rather than another. That's my current project  it will be my next book. There's all kinds of reasons that you fall in love with one person rather than another. Timing is important. Proximity is important. Mystery is important. You fall in love with somebody who's somewhat mysterious  in part because mystery elevates dopamine in the brain  probably pushes you over that threshold to fall in love. You fall in love with somebody who fits within what I call your  love map   an unconscious list of traits that you build in childhood as you grow up. And I also think that you gravitate to certain people  actually  with somewhat complementary brain systems. And that's what I'm now contributing to this. But I want to tell you a story  to illustrate. I've been carrying on here about the biology of love. I wanted to show you a little bit about the culture of it  too  the magic of it. It's a story that was told to me by somebody who had heard it just from one    probably a true story. It was a graduate student    I'm at Rutgers and my two colleagues    Art Aron is at SUNY Stony Brook. That's where we put our people in the MRI machine. And this graduate student was madly in love with another graduate student  and she was not in love with him. And they were all at a conference in Beijing. And he knew from our work that if you go and do something very novel with somebody  you can drive up the dopamine in the brain  and perhaps trigger this brain system for romantic love. So he decided he'd put science to work. And he invited this girl to go off on a rickshaw ride with him. And sure enough    I've never been in one  but apparently they go all around the buses and the trucks and it's crazy and it's noisy and it's exciting. He figured that this would drive up the dopamine  and she'd fall in love with him. So off they go and she's squealing and squeezing him and laughing and having a wonderful time. An hour later they get down off of the rickshaw  and she throws her hands up and she says   Wasn't that wonderful   And   Wasn't that rickshaw driver handsome   There's magic to love  But I will end by saying that millions of years ago  we evolved three basic drives  the sex drive  romantic love and attachment to a long term partner. These circuits are deeply embedded in the human brain. They're going to survive as long as our species survives on what Shakespeare called  this mortal coil.  Thank you. Chris Anderson  Helen Fisher  I bet you're worried. I was worried. That's why I began this piece. I was worried about vaginas. I was worried what we think about vaginas and even more worried that we don't think about them. I was worried about my own vagina. It needed a context  a culture  a community of other vaginas. There is so much darkness and secrecy surrounding them. Like the Bermuda Triangle  nobody ever reports back from there. In the first place  it's not so easy to even find your vagina. Women go days  weeks  months  without looking at it. I interviewed a high powered businesswoman  she told me she didn't have time.  Looking at your vagina   she said   is a full day's work.   You've got to get down there on your back  in front of a mirror  full length preferred. You've got to get in the perfect position with the perfect light  which then becomes shadowed by the angle you're at. You're twisting your head up  arching your back  it's exhausting.  She was busy  she didn't have time. So I decided to talk to women about their vaginas. They began as casual vagina interviews  and they turned into vagina monologues. I talked with over     women. I talked to older women  younger women  married women  lesbians  single women. I talked to corporate professionals  college professors  actors  sex workers. I talked to African American women  Asian American women  Native American women  Caucasian women  Jewish women. OK  at first women were a little shy  a little reluctant to talk. Once they got going  you couldn't stop them. Women love to talk about their vaginas  they do. Mainly because no one's ever asked them before. Let's just start with the word  vagina     vagina  vagina. It sounds like an infection  at best. Maybe a medical instrument.  Hurry  nurse  bring the vagina   Vagina  vagina  vagina. It doesn't matter how many times you say the word  it never sounds like a word you want to say. It's a completely ridiculous  totally un sexy word. If you use it during sex  trying to be politically correct   Darling  would you stroke my vagina   you kill the act right there. I'm worried what we call them and don't call them. In Great Neck  New York  they call it a Pussycat. A woman told me there her mother used to tell her   Don't wear panties  dear  underneath your pajamas. You need to air out your Pussycat.  In Westchester  they call it a Pooki  in New Jersey  a twat. There's Powderbox  derriere  a Pooky  a Poochi  a Poopi  a Poopelu  a Pooninana  a Padepachetchki  a Pal  and a Piche. There's Toadie  Dee Dee  Nishi  Dignity  Coochi Snorcher  Cooter  Labbe  Gladys Seagelman  VA  Wee wee  Horsespot  Nappy Dugout  Mongo  Ghoulie  Powderbox  a Mimi in Miami  a Split Knish in Philadelphia ... and a Schmende in the Bronx. I am worried about vaginas. This is how the  Vagina Monologues  begins. But it really didn't begin there. It began with a conversation with a woman. We were having a conversation about menopause  and we got onto the subject of her vagina  which you'll do if you're talking about menopause. And she said things that really shocked me about her vagina    that it was dried up and finished and dead    and I was kind of shocked. So I said to a friend casually   Well  what do you think about your vagina   And that woman said something more amazing  and then the next woman said something more amazing  and before I knew it  every woman was telling me I had to talk to somebody about their vagina because they had an amazing story  and I was sucked down the vagina trail. And I really haven't gotten off of it. I think if you had told me when I was younger that I was going to grow up  and be in shoe stores  and people would scream out   There she is  the Vagina Lady   I don't know that that would have been my life ambition. But I want to talk a little bit about happiness  and the relationship to this whole vagina journey  because it has been an extraordinary journey that began eight years ago. I think before I did the  Vagina Monologues   I didn't really believe in happiness. I thought that only idiots were happy  to be honest. I remember when I started practicing Buddhism    years ago  and I was told that the end of this practice was to be happy  I said   How could you be happy and live in this world of suffering and live in this world of pain   I mistook happiness for a lot of other things  like numbness or decadence or selfishness. And what happened through the course of the  Vagina Monologues  and this journey is  I think I have come to understand a little bit more about happiness. There are three qualities I want to talk about. One is seeing what's right in front of you  and talking about it  and stating it. I think what I learned from talking about the vagina and speaking about the vagina  is it was the most obvious thing    it was right in the center of my body and the center of the world    and yet it was the one thing nobody talked about. The second thing is that what talking about the vagina did is it opened this door which allowed me to see that there was a way to serve the world to make it better. And that's where the deepest happiness has actually come from. And the third principle of happiness  which I've realized recently  Eight years ago  this momentum and this energy  this  V wave  started    and I can only describe it as a  V wave  because  to be honest  I really don't understand it completely  I feel at the service of it. But this wave started  and if I question the wave  or try to stop the wave or look back at the wave  I often have the experience of whiplash or the potential of my neck breaking. But if I go with the wave  and I trust the wave and I move with the wave  I go to the next place  and it happens logically and organically and truthfully. And I started this piece  particularly with stories and narratives  and I was talking to one woman and that led to another woman and that led to another woman. And then I wrote those stories down  and I put them out in front of other people. And every single time I did the show at the beginning  women would literally line up after the show  because they wanted to tell me their stories. And at first I thought   Oh great  I'll hear about wonderful orgasms  and great sex lives  and how women love their vaginas.  But in fact  that's not what women lined up to tell me. What women lined up to tell me was how they were raped  and how they were battered  and how they were beaten  and how they were gang raped in parking lots  and how they were incested by their uncles. And I wanted to stop doing the  Vagina Monologues   because it felt too daunting. I felt like a war photographer who takes pictures of terrible events  but doesn't intervene on their behalf. And so in       I said   Let's get women together. What could we do with this information that all these women are being violated   And it turned out  after thinking and investigating  that I discovered    and the UN has actually said this recently    that one out of every three women on this planet will be beaten or raped in her lifetime. That's essentially a gender  that's essentially the resource of the planet  which is women. So in      we got all these incredible women together and we said   How can we use the play  this energy  to stop violence against women   And we put on one event in New York City  in the theater  and all these great actors came    from Susan Sarandon  to Glenn Close  to Whoopi Goldberg    and we did one performance on one evening  and that catalyzed this wave  this energy. And within five years  this extraordinary thing began to happen. One woman took that energy and she said   I want to bring this wave  this energy  to college campuses   and so she took the play and she said   Let's use the play and have performances once a year  where we can raise money to stop violence against women in local communities all around the world.  And in one year  it went to    colleges  and then it expanded. And over the course of the last six years  it's spread and it's spread and it's spread around the world. What I have learned is two things  one  that the epidemic of violence towards women is shocking  it's global  it is so profound and it is so devastating  and it is so in every little pocket of every little crater  of every little society that we don't even recognize it  because it's become ordinary. This journey has taken me to Afghanistan  where I had the extraordinary honor and privilege to go into parts of Afghanistan under the Taliban. I was dressed in a burqa and I went in with an extraordinary group  called the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan. And I saw firsthand how women had been stripped of every single right that was possible to strip women of    from being educated  to being employed  to being actually allowed to eat ice cream. For those of you who don't know  it was illegal to eat ice cream under the Taliban. And I actually saw and met women who had been flogged for being caught eating vanilla ice cream. I was taken to the secret ice cream eating place in a little town  where we went to a back room  and women were seated and a curtain was pulled around us  and they were served vanilla ice cream. And women lifted their burqas and ate this ice cream. And I don't think I ever understood pleasure until that moment  and how women have found a way to keep their pleasure alive. It has taken me  this journey  to Islamabad  where I have witnessed and met women with their faces melted off. It has taken me to Juarez  Mexico  where I was a week ago  where I have literally been there in parking lots  where bones of women have washed up and been dumped next to Coca Cola bottles. It has taken me to universities all over this country  where girls are date raped and drugged. I have seen terrible  terrible  terrible violence. But I have also recognized  in the course of seeing that violence  that being in the face of things and seeing actually what's in front of us is the antidote to depression  and to a feeling that one is worthless and has no value. Because before the  Vagina Monologues   I will say that    percent of my consciousness was closed off to what was really going on in this reality  and that closing off closed off my vitality and my life energy. What has also happened is in the course of these travels    and it's been an extraordinary thing    is that every single place that I have gone to in the world  I have met a new species. And I really love hearing about all these species at the bottom of the sea. And I was thinking about how being with these extraordinary people on this particular panel  that it's beneath  beyond and between  and the vagina kind of fits into all those categories. But one of the things I've seen is this species    and it is a species  and it is a new paradigm  and it doesn't get reported in the press or in the media because I don't think good news ever is news  and I don't think people who are transforming the planet are what gets the ratings on TV shows. But every single country I have been to    and in the last six years  I've been to about    countries  and many tiny little villages and cities and towns    I have seen something what I've come to call  vagina warriors.  A  vagina warrior  is a woman  or a vagina friendly man  who has witnessed incredible violence or suffered it  and rather than getting an AK    or a weapon of mass destruction or a machete  they hold the violence in their bodies  they grieve it  they experience it  and then they go out and devote their lives to making sure it doesn't happen to anybody else. I have met these women everywhere on the planet  and I want to tell a few stories  because I believe that stories are the way that we transmit information  where it goes into our bodies. And I think one of the things about being at TED that's been very interesting is that I live in my body a lot  and I don't live in my head very much anymore. And this is a very heady place. And it's been really interesting to be in my head for the last two days  I've been very disoriented    because I think the world  the V world  is very much in your body. It's a body world  and the species really exists in the body. And I think there's a real significance in us attaching our bodies to our heads  that that separation has created a divide that is often separating purpose from intent. And the connection between body and head often brings those things into union. I want to talk about three particular people that I've met  vagina warriors  who really transformed my understanding of this whole principle and species  and one is a woman named Marsha Lopez. Marsha Lopez was a woman I met in Guatemala. She was    years old  and she was in a marriage and her husband was beating her on a regular basis. And she couldn't get out  because she was addicted to the relationship  and she had no money. Her sister was younger than her  and she applied    we had a  Stop Rape  contest a few years ago in New York    and she applied  hoping that she would become a finalist and she could bring her sister. She did become a finalist  she brought Marsha to New York. And at that time  we did this extraordinary V Day at Madison Square Garden  where we sold out the entire testosterone filled dome           people standing up to say  Yes  to vaginas  which was really a pretty incredible transformation. And she came  and she witnessed this  and she decided that she would go back and leave her husband  and that she would bring V Day to Guatemala. She was    years old. I went to Guatemala and she had sold out the National Theater of Guatemala. And I watched her walk up on stage in her red short dress and high heels  and she stood there and said   My name is Marsha. I was beaten by my husband for five years. He almost murdered me. I left and you can  too.  And the entire       people went absolutely crazy. There's a woman named Esther Ch vez who I met in Juarez  Mexico. And Esther Ch vez was a brilliant accountant in Mexico City. She was    years old and she was planning to retire. She went to Juarez to take care of an ailing aunt  and in the course of it  she began to discover what was happening to the murdered and disappeared women of Juarez. She gave up her life  she moved to Juarez. She started to write the stories which documented the disappeared women.     women have disappeared in a border town because they're brown and poor. There has been no response to the disappearance  and not one person has been held accountable. She began to document it. She opened a center called Casa Amiga  and in six years  she has literally brought this to the consciousness of the world. We were there a week ago  when there were       people in the street  and it was truly a miracle. And as we walked through the streets  the people of Juarez  who normally don't even come into the streets  because the streets are so dangerous  literally stood there and wept  to see that other people from the world had showed up for that particular community. There's another woman  named Agnes. And Agnes  for me  epitomizes what a vagina warrior is. I met her three years ago in Kenya. And Agnes was mutilated as a little girl  she was circumcised against her will when she was    years old  and she really made a decision that she didn't want this practice to continue anymore in her community. So when she got older  she created this incredible thing  it's an anatomical sculpture of a woman's body  half a woman's body. And she walked through the Rift Valley  and she had vagina and vagina replacement parts  where she would teach girls and parents and boys and girls what a healthy vagina looks like  and what a mutilated vagina looks like. And in the course of her travel    she walked literally for eight years through the Rift Valley  through dust  through sleeping on the ground  because the Maasai are nomads  and she would have to find them  and they would move  and she would find them again    she saved       girls from being cut. And in that time  she created an alternative ritual  which involved girls coming of age without the cut. When we met her three years ago  we said   What could V Day do for you   And she said   Well  if you got me a jeep  I could get around a lot faster.  So we bought her a jeep. And in the year that she had the jeep  she saved       girls from being cut. So we said to her   What else could we do for you   She said   Well  Eve  if you gave me some money  I could open a house and girls could run away  and they could be saved.  And I want to tell this little story about my own beginnings  because it's very interrelated to happiness and Agnes. When I was a little girl    I grew up in a wealthy community  it was an upper middle class white community  and it had all the trappings and the looks of a perfectly nice  wonderful  great life. And everyone was supposed to be happy in that community  and  in fact  my life was hell. I lived with an alcoholic father who beat me and molested me  and it was all inside that. And always as a child I had this fantasy that somebody would come and rescue me. And I actually made up a little character whose name was Mr. Alligator. I would call him up when things got really bad  and say it was time to come and pick me up. And I would pack a little bag and wait for Mr. Alligator to come. Now  Mr. Alligator never did come  but the idea of Mr. Alligator coming actually saved my sanity and made it OK for me to keep going  because I believed  in the distance  there would be someone coming to rescue me. Cut to    some odd years later  we go to Kenya  and we're walking  we arrive at the opening of this house. And Agnes hadn't let me come to the house for days  because they were preparing this whole ritual. I want to tell you a great story. When Agnes first started fighting to stop female genital mutilation in her community  she had become an outcast  and she was exiled and slandered  and the whole community turned against her. But being a vagina warrior  she kept going  and she kept committing herself to transforming consciousness. And in the Maasai community  goats and cows are the most valued possession. They're like the Mercedes Benz of the Rift Valley. And she said two days before the house opened  two different people arrived to give her a goat each  and she said to me   I knew then that female genital mutilation would end one day in Africa.  Anyway  we arrived  and when we arrived  there were hundreds of girls dressed in red homemade dresses    which is the color of the Maasai and the color of V Day    and they greeted us. They had made up these songs that they were singing  about the end of suffering and the end of mutilation  and they walked us down the path. It was a gorgeous day in the African sun  and the dust was flying and the girls were dancing  and there was this house  and it said   V Day Safe House for the Girls.  And it hit me in that moment that it had taken    years  but that Mr. Alligator had finally shown up. And he had shown up  obviously  in a form that it took me a long time to understand  which is that when we give in the world what we want the most  we heal the broken part inside each of us. And I feel  in the last eight years  that this journey    this miraculous vagina journey    has taught me this really simple thing  which is that happiness exists in action  it exists in telling the truth and saying what your truth is  and it exists in giving away what you want the most. And I feel that knowledge and that journey has been an extraordinary privilege  and I feel really blessed to have been here today to communicate that to you. Thank you very much. We've been told to go out on a limb and say something surprising. So I'll try and do that  but I want to start with two things that everyone already knows. And the first one  in fact  is something that has been known for most of recorded history  and that is  that the planet Earth  or the solar system  or our environment or whatever  is uniquely suited to sustain our evolution    or creation  as it used to be thought    and our present existence  and most important  our future survival. Nowadays  this idea has a dramatic name  Spaceship Earth. And the idea there is that outside the spaceship  the universe is implacably hostile  and inside is all we have  all we depend on  and we only get the one chance  if we mess up our spaceship  we've got nowhere else to go. Now  the second thing that everyone already knows is that  contrary to what was believed for most of human history  human beings are not  in fact  the hub of existence. As Stephen Hawking famously said  we're just a chemical scum on the surface of a typical planet that's in orbit around a typical star  which is on the outskirts of a typical galaxy  and so on. Now  the first of those two things that everyone knows is kind of saying that we're at a very un typical place  uniquely suited and so on  and the second one is saying that we're at a typical place. And  especially if you regard these two as deep truths to live by and to inform your life decisions  then they seem a little bit to conflict with each other. But that doesn't prevent them from both being completely false. And they are. So let me start with the second one   Typical.  Well  is this a typical place  Well  let's look around  you know  look in a random direction  and we see a wall  and chemical scum    and that's not typical of the universe at all. All you've got to do is go a few hundred miles in that same direction and look back  and you won't see any walls or chemical scum at all    all you see is a blue planet. And if you go further than that  you'll see the Sun  the solar system and the stars and so on  but that's still not typical of the universe  because stars come in galaxies. And most places in the universe  a typical place in the universe  is nowhere near any galaxies. So let's go out further  till we're outside the galaxy  and look back  and yeah  there's the huge galaxy with spiral arms laid out in front of us. And at this point  we've come         light years from here. But we're still nowhere near a typical place in the universe. To get to a typical place  you've got to go       times as far as that  into intergalactic space. And so  what does that look like     typical   What does a  typical  place in the universe look like  Well  at enormous expense  TED has arranged a high resolution immersion virtual reality rendering of the view from intergalactic space. Can we have the lights off  please  so we can see it  Well  not quite  not quite perfect. You see  intergalactic space is completely dark  pitch dark. It's so dark  that if you were to be looking at the nearest star to you  and that star were to explode as a supernova  and you were to be staring directly at it at the moment when its light reached you  you still wouldn't be able to see even a glimmer. That's how big and how dark the universe is. And that's despite the fact that a supernova is so bright  so brilliant an event  that it would kill you stone dead at a range of several light years. And yet  from intergalactic space  it's so far away you wouldn't even see it. It's also very cold out there    less than three degrees above absolute zero. And it's very empty. The vacuum there is one million times less dense than the highest vacuum that our best technology on Earth can currently create. So that's how different a typical place is from this place. And that is how un typical this place is. So can we have the lights back on please  Thank you. Now  how do we know about an environment that's so far away and so different and so alien from anything we're used to  Well  the Earth    our environment  in the form of us    is creating knowledge. Well  what does that mean  Well  look out even further than we've just been    I mean from here  with a telescope    and you'll see things that look like stars  they're called quasars.  Quasars  originally meant  quasi stellar object   which means  things that look a bit like stars.  But they're not stars. And we know what they are. Billions of years ago and billions of light years away  the material at the center of a galaxy collapsed towards a super massive black hole. And then intense magnetic fields directed some of the energy of that gravitational collapse and some of the matter back out in the form of tremendous jets  which illuminated lobes with the brilliance of    I think it's a trillion    suns. Now  the physics of the human brain could hardly be more unlike the physics of such a jet. We couldn't survive for an instant in it. Language breaks down when trying to describe what it would be like in one of those jets. It would be a bit like experiencing a supernova explosion  but at point blank range and for millions of years at a time. And yet  that jet happened in precisely such a way that billions of years later  on the other side of the universe  some bit of chemical scum could accurately describe and model and predict and explain  above all    there's your reference    what was happening there  in reality. The one physical system  the brain  contains an accurate working model of the other  the quasar. Not just a superficial image of it  though it contains that as well  but an explanatory model  embodying the same mathematical relationships and the same causal structure. Now  that is knowledge. And if that weren't amazing enough  the faithfulness with which the one structure resembles the other is increasing with time. That is the growth of knowledge. So  the laws of physics have this special property  that physical objects as unlike each other as they could possibly be  can nevertheless embody the same mathematical and causal structure and to do it more and more so over time. So we are a chemical scum that is different. This chemical scum has universality. Its structure contains  with ever increasing precision  the structure of everything. This place  and not other places in the universe  is a hub which contains within itself the structural and causal essence of the whole of the rest of physical reality. And so  far from being insignificant  the fact that the laws of physics allow this or even mandate that this can happen  is one of the most important things about the physical world. Now how does the solar system    our environment  in the form of us    acquire this special relationship with the rest of the universe  Well  one thing that's true about Stephen Hawking's remark    I mean  it is true  but it's the wrong emphasis. One thing that's true about it is that it doesn't do it with any special physics  there's no special dispensation  no miracles involved. It does it simply with three things that we have here in abundance. One of them is matter  because the growth of knowledge is a form of information processing. Information processing is computation  computation requires a computer    there's no known way of making a computer without matter. We also need energy to make the computer  and most important  to make the media  in effect  onto which we record the knowledge that we discover. And then thirdly  less tangible but just as essential for the open ended creation of knowledge  of explanations  is evidence. Now  our environment is inundated with evidence. We happen to get round to testing  let's say  Newton's Law of Gravity  about     years ago. But the evidence that we used to do that was falling down on every square meter of the Earth for billions of years before that  and will continue to fall for billions of years afterwards. And the same is true for all the other sciences. As far as we know  evidence to discover the most fundamental truths of all the sciences is here just for the taking  on our planet. Our location is saturated with evidence and also with matter and energy. Out in intergalactic space  those three prerequisites for the open ended creation of knowledge are at their lowest possible supply    as I said  it's empty  it's cold and it's dark out there. Or is it  Now actually  that's just another parochial misconception. Because imagine a cube out there in intergalactic space  the same size as our home  the solar system. Now that cube is very empty by human standards  but that still means that it contains over a million tons of matter. And a million tons is enough to make  say  a self contained space station  on which there's a colony of scientists that are devoted to creating an open ended stream of knowledge  and so on. Now  it's way beyond present technology to even gather the hydrogen from intergalactic space and form it into other elements and so on. But the thing is  in a comprehensible universe  if something isn't forbidden by the laws of physics  then what could possibly prevent us from doing it  other than knowing how  In other words  it's a matter of knowledge  not resources. If we could do that  we'd automatically have an energy supply  because this transmutation would be a fusion reactor. And evidence  Well  again  it's dark out there to human senses  but all you've got to do is take a telescope  even one of present day design  look out  and you'll see the same galaxies as we do from here. And with a more powerful telescope  you'll be able to see stars and planets in those galaxies  you'll be able to do astrophysics and learn the laws of physics. And locally there you could build particle accelerators  and learn elementary particle physics and chemistry  and so on. Probably the hardest science to do would be biology field trips    because it would take several hundred million years to get to the nearest life bearing planet and back. But I have to tell you    and sorry  Richard    but I never did like biology field trips much  and I think we can just about make do with one every few hundred million years. So in fact  intergalactic space does contain all the prerequisites for the open ended creation of knowledge. Any such cube anywhere in the universe could become the same kind of hub that we are  if the knowledge of how to do so were present there. So  we're not in a uniquely hospitable place. If intergalactic space is capable of creating an open ended stream of explanations  then so is almost every other environment  so is the Earth. So is a polluted Earth. And the limiting factor  there and here  is not resources  because they're plentiful  but knowledge  which is scarce. Now this cosmic knowledge based view may    and I think ought to    make us feel very special. But it should also make us feel vulnerable  because it means that without the specific knowledge that's needed to survive the ongoing challenges of the universe  we won't survive them. All it takes is for a supernova to go off a few light years away  and we'll all be dead  Martin Rees has recently written a book about our vulnerability to all sorts of things  from astrophysics  to scientific experiments gone wrong  and most importantly  to terrorism with weapons of mass destruction. And he thinks that civilization has only a    percent chance of surviving this century. I think he's going to talk about that later in the conference. Now  I don't think that probability is the right category to discuss this issue in  but I do agree with him about this  We can survive and we can fail to survive. But it depends not on chance  but on whether we create the relevant knowledge in time. The danger is not at all unprecedented. Species go extinct all the time. Civilizations end. The overwhelming majority of all species and all civilizations that have ever existed are now history. And if we want to be the exception to that  then logically  our only hope is to make use of the one feature that distinguishes our species and civilization from all the others    namely  our special relationship with the laws of physics  our ability to create new explanations  new knowledge    to be a hub of existence. So let me now apply this to a current controversy  not because I want to advocate any particular solution  but just to illustrate the kind of thing I mean. And the controversy is global warming. Now  I'm a physicist  but I'm not the right kind of physicist. In regard to global warming  I'm just a layman. And the rational thing for a layman to do is to take seriously the prevailing scientific theory. And according to that theory  it's already too late to avoid a disaster  because if it's true that our best option at the moment is to prevent CO  emissions with something like the Kyoto Protocol  with its constraints on economic activity and its enormous cost of hundreds of billions of dollars  or whatever it is  then that is already a disaster by any reasonable measure. And the actions that are advocated are not even purported to solve the problem  merely to postpone it by a little. So it's already too late to avoid it  and it probably has been too late to avoid it ever since before anyone realized the danger. It was probably already too late in the     s  when the best available scientific theory was telling us that industrial emissions were about to precipitate a new ice age  in which billions would die. Now  the lesson of that seems clear to me  and I don't know why it isn't informing public debate. It is that we can't always know. When we know of an impending disaster  and how to solve it at a cost less than the cost of the disaster itself  then there's not going to be much argument  really. But no precautions and no precautionary principle can avoid problems that we do not yet foresee. Hence  we need a stance of problem fixing  not just problem avoidance. And it's true that an ounce of prevention equals a pound of cure  but that's only if we know what to prevent. If you've been punched on the nose  then the science of medicine does not consist of teaching you how to avoid punches. If medical science stopped seeking cures and concentrated on prevention only  then it would achieve very little of either. The world is buzzing at the moment with plans to force reductions in gas emissions at all costs. It ought to be buzzing with plans to reduce the temperature  and with plans to live at the higher temperature    and not at all costs  but efficiently and cheaply. And some such plans exist  things like swarms of mirrors in space to deflect the sunlight away  and encouraging aquatic organisms to eat more carbon dioxide. At the moment  these things are fringe research  they're not central to the human effort to face this problem  or problems in general. And with problems that we are not aware of yet  the ability to put right    not the sheer good luck of avoiding indefinitely    is our only hope  not just of solving problems  but of survival. So take two stone tablets  and carve on them. On one of them  carve   Problems are soluble.  And on the other one  carve   Problems are inevitable.  Thank you. My title   Queerer than we can suppose  the strangeness of science.   Queerer than we can suppose  comes from J.B.S. Haldane  the famous biologist  who said   Now  my own suspicion is that the universe is not only queerer than we suppose  but queerer than we can suppose. I suspect that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of  or can be dreamed of  in any philosophy.  Richard Feynman compared the accuracy of quantum theories    experimental predictions    to specifying the width of North America to within one hair's breadth of accuracy. This means that quantum theory has got to be  in some sense  true. Yet the assumptions that quantum theory needs to make in order to deliver those predictions are so mysterious that even Feynman himself was moved to remark   If you think you understand quantum theory  you don't understand quantum theory.  It's so queer that physicists resort to one or another paradoxical interpretation of it. David Deutsch  who's talking here  in  The Fabric of Reality   embraces the many worlds interpretation of quantum theory  because the worst that you can say about it is that it's preposterously wasteful. It postulates a vast and rapidly growing number of universes existing in parallel  mutually undetectable  except through the narrow porthole of quantum mechanical experiments. And that's Richard Feynman. The biologist Lewis Wolpert believes that the queerness of modern physics is just an extreme example. Science  as opposed to technology  does violence to common sense. Every time you drink a glass of water  he points out  the odds are that you will imbibe at least one molecule that passed through the bladder of Oliver Cromwell. It's just elementary probability theory. The number of molecules per glassful is hugely greater than the number of glassfuls  or bladdersful  in the world. And of course  there's nothing special about Cromwell or bladders    you have just breathed in a nitrogen atom that passed through the right lung of the third iguanodon to the left of the tall cycad tree.  Queerer than we can suppose.  What is it that makes us capable of supposing anything  and does this tell us anything about what we can suppose  Are there things about the universe that will be forever beyond our grasp  but not beyond the grasp of some superior intelligence  Are there things about the universe that are  in principle  ungraspable by any mind  however superior  The history of science has been one long series of violent brainstorms  as successive generations have come to terms with increasing levels of queerness in the universe. We're now so used to the idea that the Earth spins  rather than the Sun moves across the sky  it's hard for us to realize what a shattering mental revolution that must have been. After all  it seems obvious that the Earth is large and motionless  the Sun  small and mobile. But it's worth recalling Wittgenstein's remark on the subject   Tell me   he asked a friend   why do people always say it was natural for man to assume that the Sun went 'round the Earth  rather than that the Earth was rotating   And his friend replied   Well  obviously  because it just looks as though the Sun is going round the Earth.  Wittgenstein replied   Well  what would it have looked like if it had looked as though the Earth was rotating   Science has taught us  against all intuition  that apparently solid things  like crystals and rocks  are really almost entirely composed of empty space. And the familiar illustration is the nucleus of an atom is a fly in the middle of a sports stadium  and the next atom is in the next sports stadium. So it would seem the hardest  solidest  densest rock is really almost entirely empty space  broken only by tiny particles so widely spaced they shouldn't count. Why  then  do rocks look and feel solid and hard and impenetrable  As an evolutionary biologist  I'd say this  our brains have evolved to help us survive within the orders of magnitude  of size and speed which our bodies operate at. We never evolved to navigate in the world of atoms. If we had  our brains probably would perceive rocks as full of empty space. Rocks feel hard and impenetrable to our hands  precisely because objects like rocks and hands cannot penetrate each other. It's therefore useful for our brains to construct notions like  solidity  and  impenetrability   because such notions help us to navigate our bodies through the middle sized world in which we have to navigate. Moving to the other end of the scale  our ancestors never had to navigate through the cosmos at speeds close to the speed of light. If they had  our brains would be much better at understanding Einstein. I want to give the name  Middle World  to the medium scaled environment in which we've evolved the ability to take act    nothing to do with  Middle Earth     Middle World. We are evolved denizens of Middle World  and that limits what we are capable of imagining. We find it intuitively easy to grasp ideas like  when a rabbit moves at the sort of medium velocity at which rabbits and other Middle World objects move  and hits another Middle World object like a rock  it knocks itself out. May I introduce Major General Albert Stubblebine III  commander of military intelligence in     .  ... He  stared at his wall in Arlington  Virginia  and decided to do it. As frightening as the prospect was  he was going into the next office. He stood up and moved out from behind his desk. 'What is the atom mostly made of ' he thought  'Space.' He started walking. 'What am I mostly made of  Atoms.' He quickened his pace  almost to a jog now. 'What is the wall mostly made of ' 'Atoms ' All I have to do is merge the spaces. Then  General Stubblebine banged his nose hard on the wall of his office. Stubblebine  who commanded        soldiers  was confounded by his continual failure to walk through the wall. He has no doubt that this ability will one day be a common tool in the military arsenal. Who would screw around with an army that could do that   That's from an article in Playboy  which I was reading the other day. I have every reason to think it's true  I was reading Playboy because I  myself  had an article in it. Unaided human intuition  schooled in Middle World  finds it hard to believe Galileo when he tells us a heavy object and a light object  air friction aside  would hit the ground at the same instant. And that's because in Middle World  air friction is always there. If we'd evolved in a vacuum  we would expect them to hit the ground simultaneously. If we were bacteria  constantly buffeted by thermal movements of molecules  it would be different. But we Middle Worlders are too big to notice Brownian motion. In the same way  our lives are dominated by gravity  but are almost oblivious to the force of surface tension. A small insect would reverse these priorities. Steve Grand    he's the one on the left  Douglas Adams is on the right. Steve Grand  in his book   Creation  Life and How to Make It   is positively scathing about our preoccupation with matter itself. We have this tendency to think that only solid  material things are really things at all. Waves of electromagnetic fluctuation in a vacuum seem unreal. Victorians thought the waves had to be waves in some material medium  the ether. But we find real matter comforting only because we've evolved to survive in Middle World  where matter is a useful fiction. A whirlpool  for Steve Grand  is a thing with just as much reality as a rock. In a desert plain in Tanzania  in the shadow of the volcano Ol Doinyo Lengai  there's a dune made of volcanic ash. The beautiful thing is that it moves bodily. It's what's technically known as a  barchan   and the entire dune walks across the desert in a westerly direction at a speed of about    meters per year. It retains its crescent shape and moves in the direction of the horns. What happens is that the wind blows the sand up the shallow slope on the other side  and then  as each sand grain hits the top of the ridge  it cascades down on the inside of the crescent  and so the whole horn shaped dune moves. Steve Grand points out that you and I are  ourselves  more like a wave than a permanent thing. He invites us  the reader  to think of an experience from your childhood  something you remember clearly  something you can see  feel  maybe even smell  as if you were really there. After all  you really were there at the time  weren't you  How else would you remember it  But here is the bombshell  You weren't there. Not a single atom that is in your body today was there when that event took place. Matter flows from place to place and momentarily comes together to be you. Whatever you are  therefore  you are not the stuff of which you are made. If that doesn't make the hair stand up on the back of your neck  read it again until it does  because it is important. So  really  isn't a word that we should use with simple confidence. If a neutrino had a brain  which it evolved in neutrino sized ancestors  it would say that rocks really do consist of empty space. We have brains that evolved in medium sized ancestors which couldn't walk through rocks.  Really   for an animal  is whatever its brain needs it to be in order to assist its survival. And because different species live in different worlds  there will be a discomforting variety of  reallys.  What we see of the real world is not the unvarnished world  but a model of the world  regulated and adjusted by sense data  but constructed so it's useful for dealing with the real world. The nature of the model depends on the kind of animal we are. A flying animal needs a different kind of model from a walking  climbing or swimming animal. A monkey's brain must have software capable of simulating a three dimensional world of branches and trunks. A mole's software for constructing models of its world will be customized for underground use. A water strider's brain doesn't need  D software at all  since it lives on the surface of the pond  in an Edwin Abbott flatland. I've speculated that bats may see color with their ears. The world model that a bat needs in order to navigate through three dimensions catching insects must be pretty similar to the world model that any flying bird    a day flying bird like a swallow    needs to perform the same kind of tasks. The fact that the bat uses echoes in pitch darkness to input the current variables to its model  while the swallow uses light  is incidental. Bats  I've even suggested  use perceived hues  such as red and blue  as labels  internal labels  for some useful aspect of echoes    perhaps the acoustic texture of surfaces  furry or smooth and so on    in the same way as swallows or indeed  we  use those perceived hues    redness and blueness  etc.    to label long and short wavelengths of light. There's nothing inherent about red that makes it long wavelength. The point is that the nature of the model is governed by how it is to be used  rather than by the sensory modality involved. J.B.S. Haldane himself had something to say about animals whose world is dominated by smell. Dogs can distinguish two very similar fatty acids  extremely diluted  caprylic acid and caproic acid. The only difference  you see  is that one has an extra pair of carbon atoms in the chain. Haldane guesses that a dog would probably be able to place the acids in the order of their molecular weights by their smells  just as a man could place a number of piano wires in the order of their lengths by means of their notes. Now  there's another fatty acid  capric acid  which is just like the other two  except that it has two more carbon atoms. A dog that had never met capric acid would  perhaps  have no more trouble imagining its smell than we would have trouble imagining a trumpet  say  playing one note higher than we've heard a trumpet play before. Perhaps dogs and rhinos and other smell oriented animals smell in color. And the argument would be exactly the same as for the bats. Middle World    the range of sizes and speeds which we have evolved to feel intuitively comfortable with    is a bit like the narrow range of the electromagnetic spectrum that we see as light of various colors. We're blind to all frequencies outside that  unless we use instruments to help us. Middle World is the narrow range of reality which we judge to be normal  as opposed to the queerness of the very small  the very large and the very fast. We could make a similar scale of improbabilities  nothing is totally impossible. Miracles are just events that are extremely improbable. A marble statue could wave its hand at us  the atoms that make up its crystalline structure are all vibrating back and forth anyway. Because there are so many of them  and because there's no agreement among them in their preferred direction of movement  the marble  as we see it in Middle World  stays rock steady. But the atoms in the hand could all just happen to move the same way at the same time  and again and again. In this case  the hand would move  and we'd see it waving at us in Middle World. The odds against it  of course  are so great that if you set out writing zeros at the time of the origin of the universe  you still would not have written enough zeros to this day. Evolution in Middle World has not equipped us to handle very improbable events  we don't live long enough. In the vastness of astronomical space and geological time  that which seems impossible in Middle World might turn out to be inevitable. One way to think about that is by counting planets. We don't know how many planets there are in the universe  but a good estimate is about    to the     or     billion billion. And that gives us a nice way to express our estimate of life's improbability. We could make some sort of landmark points along a spectrum of improbability  which might look like the electromagnetic spectrum we just looked at. If life has arisen only once on any    life could originate once per planet  could be extremely common or it could originate once per star or once per galaxy or maybe only once in the entire universe  in which case it would have to be here. And somewhere up there would be the chance that a frog would turn into a prince  and similar magical things like that. If life has arisen on only one planet in the entire universe  that planet has to be our planet  because here we are talking about it. And that means that if we want to avail ourselves of it  we're allowed to postulate chemical events in the origin of life which have a probability as low as one in     billion billion. I don't think we shall have to avail ourselves of that  because I suspect that life is quite common in the universe. And when I say quite common  it could still be so rare that no one island of life ever encounters another  which is a sad thought. How shall we interpret  queerer than we can suppose   Queerer than can in principle be supposed  or just queerer than we can suppose  given the limitations of our brain's evolutionary apprenticeship in Middle World  Could we  by training and practice  emancipate ourselves from Middle World and achieve some sort of intuitive as well as mathematical understanding of the very small and the very large  I genuinely don't know the answer. I wonder whether we might help ourselves to understand  say  quantum theory  if we brought up children to play computer games beginning in early childhood  which had a make believe world of balls going through two slits on a screen  a world in which the strange goings on of quantum mechanics were enlarged by the computer's make believe  so that they became familiar on the Middle World scale of the stream. And similarly  a relativistic computer game  in which objects on the screen manifest the Lorentz contraction  and so on  to try to get ourselves    to get children into the way of thinking about it. I want to end by applying the idea of Middle World to our perceptions of each other. Most scientists today subscribe to a mechanistic view of the mind  we're the way we are because our brains are wired up as they are  our hormones are the way they are. We'd be different  our characters would be different  if our neuro anatomy and our physiological chemistry were different. But we scientists are inconsistent. If we were consistent  our response to a misbehaving person  like a child murderer  should be something like  this unit has a faulty component  it needs repairing. That's not what we say. What we say    and I include the most austerely mechanistic among us  which is probably me    what we say is   Vile monster  prison is too good for you.  Or worse  we seek revenge  in all probability thereby triggering the next phase in an escalating cycle of counter revenge  which we see  of course  all over the world today. In short  when we're thinking like academics  we regard people as elaborate and complicated machines  like computers or cars. But when we revert to being human  we behave more like Basil Fawlty  who  we remember  thrashed his car to teach it a lesson  when it wouldn't start on  Gourmet Night.  The reason we personify things like cars and computers is that just as monkeys live in an arboreal world and moles live in an underground world and water striders live in a surface tension dominated flatland  we live in a social world. We swim through a sea of people    a social version of Middle World. We are evolved to second guess the behavior of others by becoming brilliant  intuitive psychologists. Treating people as machines may be scientifically and philosophically accurate  but it's a cumbersome waste of time if you want to guess what this person is going to do next. The economically useful way to model a person is to treat him as a purposeful  goal seeking agent with pleasures and pains  desires and intentions  guilt  blame worthiness. Personification and the imputing of intentional purpose is such a brilliantly successful way to model humans  it's hardly surprising the same modeling software often seizes control when we're trying to think about entities for which it's not appropriate  like Basil Fawlty with his car or like millions of deluded people  with the universe as a whole. If the universe is queerer than we can suppose  is it just because we've been naturally selected to suppose only what we needed to suppose in order to survive in the Pleistocene of Africa  Or are our brains so versatile and expandable that we can train ourselves to break out of the box of our evolution  Or finally  are there some things in the universe so queer that no philosophy of beings  however godlike  could dream them  Thank you very much. I think I was supposed to talk about my new book  which is called  Blink   and it's about snap judgments and first impressions. And it comes out in January  and I hope you all buy it in triplicate. But I was thinking about this  and I realized that although my new book makes me happy  and I think would make my mother happy  it's not really about happiness. So I decided instead  I would talk about someone who I think has done as much to make Americans happy as perhaps anyone over the last    years  a man who is a great personal hero of mine  someone by the name of Howard Moskowitz  who is most famous for reinventing spaghetti sauce. Howard's about this high  and he's round  and he's in his   s  and he has big huge glasses and thinning gray hair  and he has a kind of wonderful exuberance and vitality  and he has a parrot  and he loves the opera  and he's a great aficionado of medieval history. And by profession  he's a psychophysicist. Now  I should tell you that I have no idea what psychophysics is  although at some point in my life  I dated a girl for two years who was getting her doctorate in psychophysics. Which should tell you something about that relationship. As far as I know  psychophysics is about measuring things. And Howard is very interested in measuring things. And he graduated with his doctorate from Harvard  and he set up a little consulting shop in White Plains  New York. And one of his first clients was Pepsi. This is many years ago  back in the early   s. And Pepsi came to Howard and they said   You know  there's this new thing called aspartame  and we would like to make Diet Pepsi. We'd like you to figure out how much aspartame we should put in each can of Diet Pepsi in order to have the perfect drink.  Now that sounds like an incredibly straightforward question to answer  and that's what Howard thought. Because Pepsi told him   We're working with a band between eight and    percent. Anything below eight percent sweetness is not sweet enough  anything above    percent sweetness is too sweet. We want to know  what's the sweet spot between   and      Now  if I gave you this problem to do  you would all say  it's very simple. What we do is you make up a big experimental batch of Pepsi  at every degree of sweetness    eight percent   .    .    .   all the way up to       and we try this out with thousands of people  and we plot the results on a curve  and we take the most popular concentration  right  Really simple. Howard does the experiment  and he gets the data back  and he plots it on a curve  and all of a sudden he realizes it's not a nice bell curve. In fact  the data doesn't make any sense. It's a mess. It's all over the place. Now  most people in that business  in the world of testing food and such  are not dismayed when the data comes back a mess. They think   Well  you know  figuring out what people think about cola's not that easy.   You know  maybe we made an error somewhere along the way.   You know  let's just make an educated guess   and they simply point and they go for    percent  right in the middle. Howard is not so easily placated. Howard is a man of a certain degree of intellectual standards. And this was not good enough for him  and this question bedeviled him for years. And he would think it through and say   What was wrong  Why could we not make sense of this experiment with Diet Pepsi   And one day  he was sitting in a diner in White Plains  about to go trying to dream up some work for Nescaf . And suddenly  like a bolt of lightning  the answer came to him. And that is  that when they analyzed the Diet Pepsi data  they were asking the wrong question. They were looking for the perfect Pepsi  and they should have been looking for the perfect Pepsis. Trust me. This was an enormous revelation. This was one of the most brilliant breakthroughs in all of food science. Howard immediately went on the road  and he would go to conferences around the country  and he would stand up and say   You had been looking for the perfect Pepsi. You're wrong. You should be looking for the perfect Pepsis.  And people would look at him blankly and say   What are you talking about  Craziness.  And they would say   Move  Next   Tried to get business  nobody would hire him    he was obsessed  though  and he talked about it and talked about it. Howard loves the Yiddish expression  To a worm in horseradish  the world is horseradish.  This was his horseradish. He was obsessed with it  And finally  he had a breakthrough. Vlasic Pickles came to him  and they said   Doctor Moskowitz  we want to make the perfect pickle.  And he said   There is no perfect pickle  there are only perfect pickles.  And he came back to them and he said   You don't just need to improve your regular  you need to create zesty.  And that's where we got zesty pickles. Then the next person came to him  Campbell's Soup. And this was even more important. In fact  Campbell's Soup is where Howard made his reputation. Campbell's made Prego  and Prego  in the early   s  was struggling next to Rag   which was the dominant spaghetti sauce of the   s and   s. In the industry    I don't know whether you care about this  or how much time I have to go into this. But it was  technically speaking    this is an aside    Prego is a better tomato sauce than Rag . The quality of the tomato paste is much better  the spice mix is far superior  it adheres to the pasta in a much more pleasing way. In fact  they would do the famous bowl test back in the   s with Rag  and Prego. You'd have a plate of spaghetti  and you would pour it on  right  And the Rag  would all go to the bottom  and the Prego would sit on top. That's called  adherence.  And  anyway  despite the fact that they were far superior in adherence  and the quality of their tomato paste  Prego was struggling. So they came to Howard  and they said  fix us. And Howard looked at their product line  and he said  what you have is a dead tomato society. So he said  this is what I want to do. And he got together with the Campbell's soup kitchen  and he made    varieties of spaghetti sauce. And he varied them according to every conceivable way that you can vary tomato sauce  by sweetness  by level of garlic  by tomatoey ness  by tartness  by sourness  by visible solids    my favorite term in the spaghetti sauce business. Every conceivable way you can vary spaghetti sauce  he varied spaghetti sauce. And then he took this whole raft of    spaghetti sauces  and he went on the road. He went to New York  to Chicago  he went to Jacksonville  to Los Angeles. And he brought in people by the truckload into big halls. And he sat them down for two hours  and over the course of that two hours  he gave them ten bowls. Ten small bowls of pasta  with a different spaghetti sauce on each one. And after they ate each bowl  they had to rate  from   to      how good they thought the spaghetti sauce was. At the end of that process  after doing it for months and months  he had a mountain of data about how the American people feel about spaghetti sauce. And then he analyzed the data. Did he look for the most popular variety of spaghetti sauce  No  Howard doesn't believe that there is such a thing. Instead  he looked at the data  and he said  let's see if we can group all these different data points into clusters. Let's see if they congregate around certain ideas. And sure enough  if you sit down  and you analyze all this data on spaghetti sauce  you realize that all Americans fall into one of three groups. There are people who like their spaghetti sauce plain  there are people who like their spaghetti sauce spicy  and there are people who like it extra chunky. And of those three facts  the third one was the most significant  because at the time  in the early     s  if you went to a supermarket  you would not find extra chunky spaghetti sauce. And Prego turned to Howard  and they said   You're telling me that one third of Americans crave extra chunky spaghetti sauce and yet no one is servicing their needs   And he said  Yes   And Prego then went back  and completely reformulated their spaghetti sauce  and came out with a line of extra chunky that immediately and completely took over the spaghetti sauce business in this country. And over the next    years  they made     million dollars off their line of extra chunky sauces. Everyone else in the industry looked at Howard had done  and they said   Oh my god  We've been thinking all wrong   And that's when you started to get seven different kinds of vinegar  and    different kinds of mustard  and    different kinds of olive oil. And then eventually even Rag  hired Howard  and Howard did the exact same thing for Rag  that he did for Prego. And today  if you go to a really good supermarket  do you know how many Rag s there are      In six varieties  Cheese  Light  Robusto  Rich   Hearty  Old World Traditional    Extra Chunky Garden. That's Howard's doing. That is Howard's gift to the American people. Now why is that important  It is  in fact  enormously important. I'll explain to you why. What Howard did is he fundamentally changed the way the food industry thinks about making you happy. Assumption number one in the food industry used to be that the way to find out what people want to eat  what will make people happy  is to ask them. And for years and years and years  Rag  and Prego would have focus groups  and they would sit you down  and they would say   What do you want in a spaghetti sauce  Tell us what you want in a spaghetti sauce.  And for all those years           years    through all those focus group sessions  no one ever said they wanted extra chunky. Even though at least a third of them  deep in their hearts  actually did. People don't know what they want  As Howard loves to say   The mind knows not what the tongue wants.  It's a mystery  And a critically important step in understanding our own desires and tastes is to realize that we cannot always explain what we want  deep down. If I asked all of you  for example  in this room  what you want in a coffee  you know what you'd say  Every one of you would say   I want a dark  rich  hearty roast.  It's what people always say when you ask them.  What do you like    Dark  rich  hearty roast   What percentage of you actually like a dark  rich  hearty roast  According to Howard  somewhere between    and    percent of you. Most of you like milky  weak coffee. But you will never  ever say to someone who asks you what you want that  I want a milky  weak coffee.  So that's number one thing that Howard did. Number two thing that Howard did is he made us realize    it's another very critical point    he made us realize the importance of what he likes to call  horizontal segmentation.  Why is this critical  Because this is the way the food industry thought before Howard. What were they obsessed with in the early   s  They were obsessed with mustard. In particular  they were obsessed with the story of Grey Poupon. Used to be  there were two mustards  French's and Gulden's. What were they  Yellow mustard. What's in it  Yellow mustard seeds  turmeric  and paprika. That was mustard. Grey Poupon came along  with a Dijon. Right  Much more volatile brown mustard seed  some white wine  a nose hit  much more delicate aromatics. And what do they do  They put it in a little tiny glass jar  with a wonderful enameled label on it  made it look French  even though it's made in Oxnard  California. And instead of charging a dollar fifty for the eight ounce bottle  the way that French's and Gulden's did  they decided to charge four dollars. And they had those ads. With the guy in the Rolls Royce  eating the Grey Poupon. Another pulls up  and says   Do you have any Grey Poupon   And the whole thing  after they did that  Grey Poupon takes off  Takes over the mustard business  And everyone's take home lesson from that was that the way to make people happy is to give them something that is more expensive  something to aspire to. It's to make them turn their back on what they think they like now  and reach out for something higher up the mustard hierarchy. A better mustard  A more expensive mustard  A mustard of more sophistication and culture and meaning. And Howard looked to that and said   That's wrong   Mustard does not exist on a hierarchy. Mustard exists  just like tomato sauce  on a horizontal plane. There is no good mustard or bad mustard. There is no perfect mustard or imperfect mustard. There are only different kinds of mustards that suit different kinds of people. He fundamentally democratized the way we think about taste. And for that  as well  we owe Howard Moskowitz a huge vote of thanks. Third thing that Howard did  and perhaps the most important  is Howard confronted the notion of the Platonic dish. What do I mean by that  For the longest time in the food industry  there was a sense that there was one way  a perfect way  to make a dish. You go to Chez Panisse  they give you the red tail sashimi with roasted pumpkin seeds in a something something reduction. They don't give you five options on the reduction. They don't say   Do you want the extra chunky reduction  or ...   No  You just get the reduction. Why  Because the chef at Chez Panisse has a Platonic notion about red tail sashimi.  This is the way it ought to be.  And she serves it that way time and time again  and if you quarrel with her  she will say   You know what  You're wrong  This is the best way it ought to be in this restaurant.  Now that same idea fueled the commercial food industry as well. They had a Platonic notion of what tomato sauce was. And where did that come from  It came from Italy. Italian tomato sauce is what  It's blended  it's thin. The culture of tomato sauce was thin. When we talked about  authentic tomato sauce  in the     s  we talked about Italian tomato sauce  we talked about the earliest Rag s  which had no visible solids  right  Which were thin  you just put a little bit and it sunk down to the bottom of the pasta. That's what it was. And why were we attached to that  Because we thought that what it took to make people happy was to provide them with the most culturally authentic tomato sauce  A. And B  we thought that if we gave them the culturally authentic tomato sauce  then they would embrace it. And that's what would please the maximum number of people. In other words  people in the cooking world were looking for cooking universals. They were looking for one way to treat all of us. And it's good reason for them to be obsessed with the idea of universals  because all of science  through the   th century and much of the   th  was obsessed with universals. Psychologists  medical scientists  economists were all interested in finding out the rules that govern the way all of us behave. But that changed  right  What is the great revolution in science of the last        years  It is the movement from the search for universals to the understanding of variability. Now in medical science  we don't want to know  necessarily  just how cancer works  we want to know how your cancer is different from my cancer. I guess my cancer different from your cancer. Genetics has opened the door to the study of human variability. What Howard Moskowitz was doing was saying   This same revolution needs to happen in the world of tomato sauce.  And for that  we owe him a great vote of thanks. I'll give you one last illustration of variability  and that is    oh  I'm sorry. Howard not only believed that  but he took it a second step  which was to say that when we pursue universal principles in food  we aren't just making an error  we are actually doing ourselves a massive disservice. And the example he used was coffee. And coffee is something he did a lot of work with  with Nescaf . If I were to ask all of you to try and come up with a brand of coffee    a type of coffee  a brew    that made all of you happy  and then I asked you to rate that coffee  the average score in this room for coffee would be about    on a scale of   to    . If  however  you allowed me to break you into coffee clusters  maybe three or four coffee clusters  and I could make coffee just for each of those individual clusters  your scores would go from    to    or   . The difference between coffee at    and coffee at    is a difference between coffee that makes you wince  and coffee that makes you deliriously happy. That is the final  and I think most beautiful lesson  of Howard Moskowitz  that in embracing the diversity of human beings  we will find a surer way to true happiness. Thank you. You'll be happy to know that I'll be talking not about my own tragedy  but other people's tragedy. It's a lot easier to be lighthearted about other people's tragedy than your own  and I want to keep it in the spirit of the conference. So  if you believe the media accounts  being a drug dealer in the height of the crack cocaine epidemic was a very glamorous life  in the words of Virginia Postrel. There was money  there was drugs  guns  women  you know  you name it    jewelry  bling bling    it had it all. What I'm going to tell you today is that  in fact  based on    years of research  a unique opportunity to go inside a gang    to see the actual books  the financial records of the gang    that the answer turns out not to be that being in the gang was a glamorous life. But I think  more realistically  that being in a gang    selling drugs for a gang    is perhaps the worst job in all of America. And that's what I'd like to convince you of today. So there are three things I want to do. First  I want to explain how and why crack cocaine had such a profound influence on inner city gangs. Secondly  I want to tell you how somebody like me came to be able to see the inner workings of a gang    an interesting story  I think. And then third  I want to tell you  in a very superficial way  about some of the things we found when we actually got to look at the financial records  the books  of the gang. So before I do that  just one warning  which is that this presentation has been rated 'R' by the Motion Picture Association of America. It contains adult themes  adult language. Given who is up on the stage  you'll be delighted to know that  in fact  there'll be no nudity    Unexpected wardrobe malfunctions aside. So let me start by talking about crack cocaine  and how it transformed the gang. To do that  you have to actually go back to a time before crack cocaine  in the early '  s  and look at it from the perspective of a gang leader. Being a gang leader in the inner city wasn't such a bad deal in the mid '  s    the early '  s  let me say. Now  you had a lot of power  and you got to beat people up    you got a lot of prestige  a lot of respect. But the thing is  there was no money in it. The gang had no way to make money. You couldn't charge dues to the people in the gang  because the people in the gang didn't have any money. You couldn't really make any money selling marijuana    marijuana's too cheap  it turns out. You can't get rich selling marijuana. You couldn't sell cocaine  cocaine's a great product    powdered cocaine    but you've got to know rich white people. And most of the inner city gang members didn't know any rich white people  so couldn't sell to that market. You couldn't really do petty crime  either. Turns out  petty crime's a terrible way to make a living. As a result  as a gang leader  you had  you know  power    it's a pretty good life    but the thing was  in the end  you were living at home with your mother. And so it wasn't really a career. There were limits to how powerful and important you could be if you had to live at home with your mother. Then along comes crack cocaine. And in the words of Malcolm Gladwell  crack cocaine was the extra chunky version of tomato sauce for the inner city. Because crack cocaine was an unbelievable innovation. I don't have time to talk about it today  but if you think about it  I would say that in the last    years  of every invention or innovation that's occurred in this country  the biggest one in terms of impact on the well being of people who live in the inner city  was crack cocaine. And for the worse    not for the better  but for the worse. It had a huge impact on life. So what was it about crack cocaine  It was a brilliant way of getting the brain high. Because you could smoke crack cocaine    you can't smoke powdered cocaine    and smoking is a much more efficient mechanism of delivering a high than snorting it. And it turned out there was this audience that didn't know it wanted crack cocaine  but when it came  it really did. And it was a perfect drug  you could buy the cocaine that went into it for a dollar  sell it for five dollars. Highly addictive    the high was very short. So for fifteen minutes  you get this great high  and then when you come down  all you want to do is get high again. It created a wonderful market. And for the people who were there running the gang  it was a great way  seemingly  to make a lot of money. At least for the people on the top. So this is where we enter the picture. Not really me    I'm really a bit player in all this. My co author  Sudhir Venkatesh  is the main character. He was a math major in college who had a good heart  and decided he wanted to get a sociology PhD  came to the University of Chicago. Now  the three months before he came to Chicago  he had spent following the Grateful Dead. And in his own words  he  looked like a freak.  He's a South Asian    very dark skinned South Asian. Big man  and he had hair  in his words   down to his ass.  Defied all kinds of boundaries  Was he black or white  Was he man or woman  He was really a curious sight to be seen. So he showed up at the University of Chicago  and the famous sociologist William Julius Wilson was doing a book that involved surveying people all across Chicago. He took one look at Sudhir  who was going to go do some surveys for him  and decided he knew exactly the place to send him  which was to one of the toughest  most notorious housing projects not just in Chicago  but in the entire United States. So Sudhir  the suburban boy who had never really been in the inner city  dutifully took his clipboard and walked down to this housing project  gets to the first building. The first building  Well  there's nobody there. But he hears some voices up in the stairwell  so he climbs up the stairwell  comes around the corner  and finds a group of young African American men playing dice. This is about       peak of the crack epidemic. This is a very dangerous job  being in a gang. You don't like to be surprised. You don't like to be surprised by people who come around the corner. And the mantra was  shoot first  ask questions later. Now  Sudhir was lucky    he was such a freak  and that clipboard probably saved his life  because they figured no other rival gang member would be coming up to shoot at them with a clipboard. So his greeting was not particularly warm  but they did say  well  OK    let's hear your questions on your survey. So    I kid you not    the first question on the survey that he was sent to ask was   How do you feel about being poor and Black in America   Makes you wonder about academics. So the choice of answers were   A  Very Good B  Good C  Bad D  Very Bad  What Sudhir found out is  in fact  that the real answer was the following   A  Very Good B  Good C  Bad D  Very Bad E  Fuck you  The survey was not  in the end  going to be what got Sudhir off the hook. He was held hostage overnight in the stairwell. There was a lot of gunfire  there were a lot of philosophical discussions he had with the gang members. By morning  the gang leader arrived  checked out Sudhir  decided he was no threat  and they let him go home. So Sudhir went home  took a shower  took a nap. And you and I  probably  faced with the situation  would think   I guess I'm going to write my dissertation on The Grateful Dead  I've been following them for the last three months.  Sudhir  on the other hand  got right back  walked down to the housing project  went up to the second floor  and said   Hey  guys  I had so much fun hanging out with you last night  I wonder if I could do it again tonight.  And that was the beginning of what turned out to be a beautiful relationship that involved Sudhir living in the housing project on and off for    years  hanging out in crack houses  going to jail with the gang members  having the windows shot out of his car  having the police break into his apartment and steal his computer disks    you name it. But ultimately  the story has a happy ending for Sudhir  who became one of the most respected sociologists in the country. And especially for me  as I sat in my office with my Excel spreadsheet open  waiting for Sudhir to come and deliver to me the latest load of data that he would get from the gang. It was one of the most unequal co authoring relationships ever    But I was glad to be the beneficiary of it. So what did we find  What did we find in the gang  Well  let me say one thing  We really got access to everybody in the gang. We got an inside look at the gang  from the very bottom up to the very top. They trusted Sudhir  in ways that really no academic has ever    or really anybody  any outsider    has ever earned the trust of these gangs  to the point where they actually opened up what was most interesting for me    their books  the financial records they kept. They made them available to us  and we not only could study them  but we could ask them questions about what was in them. So if I have to kind of summarize very quickly in the short time I have what the bottom line of what I take away from the gang is  it's that  if I had to draw a parallel between the gang and any other organization  it would be that the gang is just like McDonald's  in a lot of different respects    the restaurant McDonald's. So first  in one way  which isn't maybe the most interesting way  but it's a good way to start    is in the way it's organized  the hierarchy of the gang  the way it looks. So here's what the org chart of the gang looks like. I don't know if you know much about org charts  but if you were to assign a stripped down and simplified McDonald's org chart  this is exactly what it would look like. It's amazing  but the top level of the gang  they actually call themselves the  Board of Directors.  And Sudhir says it's not like these guys had a very sophisticated view of what happened in American corporate life  but they had seen movies like  Wall Street   and they had learned a little bit about what it was like to be in the real world. Now  below that board of directors  you've got essentially what are regional VPs    people who control  say  the South Side of Chicago  or the West Side of Chicago. Sudhir got to know very well the guy who had the unfortunate assignment of trying to take the Iowa franchise  which  it turned out  for this black gang  was not one of the more brilliant financial endeavors they undertook. But the thing that really makes the gang seem like McDonald's is its franchisees. The guys who are running the local gangs    the four square block by four square block areas    they're just like the guys  in some sense  who are running the McDonald's. They are the entrepreneurs. They get the exclusive property rights to control the drug selling. They get the name of the gang behind them  for merchandising and marketing. And they're the ones who basically make the profit or lose a profit  depending on how good they are at running the business. Now  the group I really want you to think about  though  are the ones at the bottom    the foot soldiers. These are the teenagers  typically  who'd be standing out on the street corner  selling the drugs. Extremely dangerous work. And important to note is that almost all of the weight  all of the people in this organization are at the bottom    just like McDonald's. So in some sense  the foot soldiers are a lot like the people who are taking your order at McDonald's  and it's not just by chance that they're like them. In fact  in these neighborhoods  they'd be the same people. So the same kids who are working in the gang were actually  at the very same time  typically working part time at a place like McDonald's. Which already foreshadows the main result that I've talked about  about what a crappy job it was  being in the gang. Because obviously  if being in the gang were such a wonderful  lucrative job  why in the world would these guys moonlight at McDonald's  So what do the wages look like  You might be surprised. But based on being able to talk to them and to see their records  this is what it looks like in terms of the wages. The hourly wage the foot soldiers were earning was   .   an hour. It was below the minimum wage. And this is well documented. It's easy to see by the patterns of consumption they have. It really is not fiction    it's fact. There was very little money in the gang  especially at the bottom. Now if you managed to rise up  say  and be that local leader  the guy who's the equivalent of the McDonald's franchisee  you'd be making         dollars a year. And that  in some ways  was the best job you could hope to get if you were growing up in one of these neighborhoods as a young black male. If you managed to rise to the very top          or         dollars a year is what you'd hope to make. Truly  you would be a great success story. And one of the sad parts of this is that  indeed  among the many other ramifications of crack cocaine is that the most talented individuals in these communities    this is what they were striving for. They weren't trying to make it in legitimate ways  because there were no legitimate channels out. This was the best way out. And it actually was the right choice  probably  to try to make it out this way. You look at this  the relationship to McDonald's breaks down here. The money looks about the same. Why is it such a bad job  Well  the reason it's such a bad job is that there's somebody shooting at you a lot of the time. So  with shooting at you  what are the death rates  We found  in our gang    and admittedly  this was not really a standard situation  this was a time of intense violence  of a lot of gang wars  as this gang actually became quite successful. But there were costs. And so the death rate    not to mention the rate of being arrested  sent to prison  being wounded    the death rate in our sample was seven percent per person per year. You're in the gang for four years  you expect to die with about a    percent likelihood. That is about as high as you can get. So for comparison's purposes  let's think about some other walk of life you may expect might be extremely risky. Let's say that you were a murderer and you were convicted of murder  and you're sent to death row. It turns out  the death rates on death row from all causes  including execution  two percent a year. So it's a lot safer being on death row than it is selling drugs out on the street. That gives you some pause  for those of you who believe that a death penalty's going to have an enormous deterrent effect on crime. To give you a sense of just how bad the inner city was during crack    and I'm not really focusing on the negatives  but really  there's another story to tell you there    if you look at the death rates just of random  young black males growing up in the inner city in the United States  the death rates during crack were about one percent. That's extremely high. And this is violent death    it's unbelievable  in some sense. To put it into perspective  if you compare this to the soldiers in Iraq  for instance  right now fighting the war   .  percent. So in some very literal way  the young black men who were growing up in this country were living in a war zone  very much in the sense that the soldiers over in Iraq are fighting in a war. So why in the world  you might ask  would anybody be willing to stand out on a street corner selling drugs for   .   an hour  with a    percent chance of dying over the next four years  Why would they do that  And I think there are a couple answers. I think the first one is that they got fooled by history. It used to be the gang was a rite of passage  that the young people controlled the gang  that as you got older  you dropped out of the gang. So what happened was  the people who happened to be in the right place at the right time    the people who happened to be leading the gang in the mid to late '  s    became very  very wealthy. And so the logical thing to think was that they are going to age out of the gang like everybody else has  and the next generation is going to take over and get the wealth. There are striking similarities  I think  to the Internet boom. The first set of people in Silicon Valley got very  very rich. And then all of my friends said   Maybe I should go do that  too.  And they were willing to work very cheap for stock options that never came. In some sense  that's what happened  exactly  to the set of people we were looking at. They were willing to start at the bottom  just like  say  a first year lawyer at a law firm is willing to start at the bottom  work    hour weeks for not that much money  because they think they're going to make partner. But the rules changed  and they never got to make partner. Indeed  the same people who were running all of the major gangs in the late     s are still running the major gangs in Chicago today. They never passed on any of the wealth  So everybody got stuck at that   .   an hour job  and it turned out to be a disaster. The other thing the gang was very good at was marketing and trickery. And so for instance  one thing the gang would do is    the gang leaders would have big entourages  and they'd drive fancy cars and have fancy jewelry. So what Sudhir eventually realized as he hung out with them more  is that  really  they didn't own those cars    they just leased them  because they couldn't afford to own the fancy cars. And they didn't really have gold jewelry  they had gold plated jewelry. It goes back to  you know  the real real versus the fake real. And really  they did all sorts of things to trick the young people into thinking what a great deal the gang was going to be. So for instance  they would give a    year old kid a whole roll of bills to hold. That    year old kid would say to his friends   Hey  look at all the money I got in the gang.  It wasn't his money    until he spent it  and then he was in debt to the gang  and was sort of an indentured servant for a while. So I have a couple minutes. Let me do one last thing I hadn't thought I'd have time to do  which is to talk about what we learned more generally about economics  from the study of the gang. So  economists tend to talk in technical words. Often  our theories fail quite miserably when we over the data  but what's kind of interesting is that in this setting  it turned out that some of the economic theories that worked not so well in the real economy worked very well in the drug economy  in some sense  because it's unfettered capitalism. Here's an economic principle. This is one of the basic ideas in labor economics  called a  compensating differential.  It's the idea that the increment to wages that a worker requires to leave him indifferent between performing two tasks  one which is more unpleasant than the other. Compensating differential    it's why we think garbagemen might be paid more than people who work in parks. The words of one of the members of the gang  I think  make this clear. So it turns out    I'm sort of getting ahead of myself    it turns out  in the gang  when there's a war going on  they actually pay the foot soldiers twice as much money. It's exactly this concept. Because they're not willing to be at risk. And the words of a gang member capture it quite nicely  he says   Would you stand around here when all this shit ...     the shooting     ... if all this shit's going on  No  right  So if I gonna be asked to put my life on the line  then front me the cash  man.  I think the gang member says it much more articulately than the economist  about what's going on. Here's another one. Economists talk about game theory  that every two person game has a Nash equilibrium. Here's the translation you get from the gang member. They're talking about the decision of why they don't go shoot    One thing that turns out to be a great business tactic in the gang  if you go and just shoot guns in the air in the other gang's territory    people are afraid to go buy drugs there  they're going to come into your neighborhood. Here's what he says about why they don't do that   If we start shooting around there  the other gang's territory  nobody  I mean  you dig it  nobody gonna step on their turf. But we gotta be careful  'cause they can shoot around here too and then we all fucked.  So that's the same concept. Then again  sometimes economists get it wrong. One thing we observed in the data is that it looked like    the gang leader always got paid. No matter how bad it was economically  he always got himself paid. We had some theories related to cash flow  and lack of access to capital markets  and things like that. Then we asked the gang member   Why is it you always get paid and your workers don't always get paid   His response is   You got all these niggers below you who want your job  you dig  If you start taking losses  they see you as weak and shit.  And I thought about it and said   CEOs often pay themselves million dollar bonuses  even when companies are losing a lot of money. And it never would really occur to an economist that this idea of 'weak and shit' could really be important.  Maybe  weak and shit  is an important hypothesis that needs more analysis. Thank you very much. I'm going to talk to you about some stuff that's in this book of mine that I hope will resonate with other things you've already heard  and I'll try to make some connections myself  in case you missed them. But I want to start with what I call the  official dogma.  The official dogma of what  The official dogma of all Western industrial societies. And the official dogma runs like this  if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens  the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom. The reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good  valuable  worthwhile  essential to being human. And because if people have freedom  then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maximize our welfare  and no one has to decide on our behalf. The way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice. The more choice people have  the more freedom they have  and the more freedom they have  the more welfare they have. This  I think  is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it wouldn't occur to anyone to question it. And it's also deeply embedded in our lives. I'll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us. This is my supermarket. Not such a big one. I want to say just a word about salad dressing.     salad dressings in my supermarket  if you don't count the    extra virgin olive oils and    balsamic vinegars you could buy to make a very large number of your own salad dressings  in the off chance that none of the     the store has on offer suit you. So this is what the supermarket is like. And then you go to the consumer electronics store to set up a stereo system    speakers  CD player  tape player  tuner  amplifier    and in this one single consumer electronics store  there are that many stereo systems. We can construct six and a half million different stereo systems out of the components that are on offer in one store. You've got to admit that's a lot of choice. In other domains    the world of communications. There was a time  when I was a boy  when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted  as long as it came from Ma Bell. You rented your phone. You didn't buy it. One consequence of that  by the way  is that the phone never broke. And those days are gone. We now have an almost unlimited variety of phones  especially in the world of cell phones. These are cell phones of the future. My favorite is the middle one    the MP  player  nose hair trimmer  and cr me br l e torch. And if by some chance you haven't seen that in your store yet  you can rest assured that one day soon  you will. And what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question. And do you know what the answer to this question now is  The answer is  no.  It is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much. So  in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things  the same explosion of choice is true. Health care. It is no longer the case in the United States that you go to the doctor  and the doctor tells you what to do. Instead  you go to the doctor  and the doctor tells you   Well  we could do A  or we could do B. A has these benefits  and these risks. B has these benefits  and these risks. What do you want to do   And you say   Doc  what should I do   And the doc says   A has these benefits and risks  and B has these benefits and risks. What do you want to do   And you say   If you were me  Doc  what would you do   And the doc says   But I'm not you.  And the result is    we call it  patient autonomy   which makes it sound like a good thing  but it really is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision making from somebody who knows something    namely  the doctor    to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions    namely  the patient. There's enormous marketing of prescription drugs to people like you and me  which  if you think about it  makes no sense at all  since we can't buy them. Why do they market to us if we can't buy them  The answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask for our prescriptions to be changed. Something as dramatic as our identity has now become a matter of choice  as this slide is meant to indicate. We don't inherit an identity  we get to invent it. And we get to re invent ourselves as often as we like. And that means that every day  when you wake up in the morning  you have to decide what kind of person you want to be. With respect to marriage and family  there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could  and then you started having kids as soon as you could. The only real choice was who  not when  and not what you did after. Nowadays  everything is very much up for grabs. I teach wonderfully intelligent students  and I assign    percent less work than I used to. And it's not because they're less smart  and it's not because they're less diligent. It's because they are preoccupied  asking themselves   Should I get married or not  Should I get married now  Should I get married later  Should I have kids first  or a career first   All of these are consuming questions. And they're going to answer these questions  whether or not it means not doing all the work I assign and not getting a good grade in my courses. And indeed they should. These are important questions to answer. Work    we are blessed  as Carl was pointing out  with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet    except the Randolph Hotel. There is one corner  by the way  that I'm not going to tell anybody about  where the WiFi actually works. I'm not telling you about it because I want to use it. So what this means  this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work  is that we have to make a decision  again and again and again  about whether we should or shouldn't be working. We can go to watch our kid play soccer  and we have our cell phone on one hip  and our Blackberry on our other hip  and our laptop  presumably  on our laps. And even if they're all shut off  every minute that we're watching our kid mutilate a soccer game  we are also asking ourselves   Should I answer this cell phone call  Should I respond to this email  Should I draft this letter   And even if the answer to the question is  no   it's certainly going to make the experience of your kid's soccer game very different than it would've been. So everywhere we look  big things and small things  material things and lifestyle things  life is a matter of choice. And the world we used to live in looked like this.  Well  actually  they are written in stone.  That is to say  there were some choices  but not everything was a matter of choice. And the world we now live in looks like this.  The Ten Commandments DYI Kit  And the question is  is this good news  or bad news  And the answer is   yes.  We all know what's good about it  so I'm going to talk about what's bad about it. All of this choice has two effects  two negative effects on people. One effect  paradoxically  is that it produces paralysis  rather than liberation. With so many options to choose from  people find it very difficult to choose at all. I'll give you one very dramatic example of this  a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans. A colleague of mine got access to investment records from Vanguard  the gigantic mutual fund company of about a million employees and about       different workplaces. And what she found is that for every    mutual funds the employer offered  rate of participation went down two percent. You offer    funds       percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five. Why  Because with    funds to choose from  it's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose  that you'll just put it off until tomorrow. And then tomorrow  and tomorrow  and tomorrow  and of course tomorrow never comes. Understand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they retire because they don't have enough money put away  it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant matching money from the employer. By not participating  they are passing up as much as       dollars a year from the employer  who would happily match their contribution. So paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices. And I think it makes the world look like this.  And lastly  for all eternity  French  bleu cheese  or ranch   You really want to get the decision right if it's for all eternity  right  You don't want to pick the wrong mutual fund  or the wrong salad dressing. So that's one effect. The second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice  we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from. And there are several reasons for this. One of them is that with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from  if you buy one  and it's not perfect    and what salad dressing is     it's easy to imagine you could have made a different choice that would have been better. And what happens is this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made  and this regret subtracts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made  even if it was a good decision. The more options there are  the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disappointing about the option that you chose. Second  what economists call  opportunity costs.  Dan Gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to. Well  when there are lots of alternatives to consider  it is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you reject that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you've chosen. Here's an example.  I can't stop thinking about those other available parking spaces on W   th street  Sorry if you're not New Yorkers. Here's what you're supposed to be thinking. Here's this couple on the Hamptons. Very expensive real estate. Gorgeous beach. Beautiful day. They have it all to themselves. What could be better   Well  damn it   this guy is thinking   It's August. Everybody in my Manhattan neighborhood is away. I could be parking right in front of my building.  And he spends two weeks nagged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity  day after day  to have a great parking space. Opportunity costs subtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose  even when what we choose is terrific. And the more options there are to consider  the more attractive features of these options are going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs. Here's another example. Now this cartoon makes a lot of points. It makes points about living in the moment as well  and probably about doing things slowly. But one point it makes is that whenever you're choosing one thing  you're choosing not to do other things that may have lots of attractive features  and it's going to make what you're doing less attractive. Third  escalation of expectations. This hit me when I went to replace my jeans. I wear jeans almost all the time. There was a time when jeans came in one flavor  and you bought them  and they fit like crap  they were incredibly uncomfortable  if you wore them and washed them enough times  they started to feel OK. I went to replace my jeans after years of wearing these old ones  and I said   I want a pair of jeans. Here's my size.  And the shopkeeper said   Do you want slim fit  easy fit  relaxed fit  You want button fly or zipper fly  You want stonewashed or acid washed  Do you want them distressed  You want boot cut  tapered  blah blah.  On and on he went. My jaw dropped. And after I recovered  I said   I want the kind that used to be the only kind.  He had no idea what that was  so I spent an hour trying on all these damn jeans  and I walked out of the store    truth     with the best fitting jeans I had ever had. I did better. All this choice made it possible for me to do better. But    I felt worse. Why  I wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself. The reason    The reason I felt worse is that  with all of these options available  my expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up. I had very low  no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor. When they came in     flavors  damn it  one of them should've been perfect. And what I got was good  but it wasn't perfect. And so I compared what I got to what I expected  and what I got was disappointing in comparison to what I expected. Adding options to people's lives can't help but increase the expectations people have about how good those options will be. And what that's going to produce is less satisfaction with results  even when they're good results. Nobody in the world of marketing knows this.  It all looks so great. I can't wait to be disappointed.  Because if they did  you wouldn't all know what this was about. The truth is more like this.  Everything was better back when everything was worse  The reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse  it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise. Nowadays  the world we live in    we affluent  industrialized citizens  with perfection the expectation    the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be. You will never be pleasantly surprised because your expectations  my expectations  have gone through the roof. The secret to happiness    this is what you all came for    the secret to happiness is low expectations.  You'll do  I want to say    just a little autobiographical moment    that I actually am married to a wife  and she's really quite wonderful. I couldn't have done better. I didn't settle. But settling isn't always such a bad thing. Finally    One consequence of buying a bad fitting pair of jeans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dissatisfied  and you ask why  who's responsible  the answer is clear  the world is responsible. What could you do  When there are hundreds of different styles of jeans available  and you buy one that is disappointing  and you ask why  who's responsible  It is equally clear that the answer to the question is  you.  You could have done better. With a hundred different kinds of jeans on display  there is no excuse for failure. And so when people make decisions  and even though the results of the decisions are good  they feel disappointed about them  they blame themselves. Clinical depression has exploded in the industrial world in the last generation. I believe a significant    not the only  but a significant    contributor to this explosion of depression  and also suicide  is that people have experiences that are disappointing because their standards are so high  and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves  they think they're at fault. And so the net result is that we do better in general  objectively  and we feel worse. So let me remind you. This is the official dogma  the one that we all take to be true  and it's all false. It is not true. There's no question that some choice is better than none  but it doesn't follow from that that more choice is better than some choice. There's some magical amount. I don't know what it is. I'm pretty confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve our welfare. Now  as a policy matter    I'm almost done    as a policy matter  the thing to think about is this  what enables all of this choice in industrial societies is material affluence. There are lots of places in the world  and we have heard about several of them  where their problem is not that they have too much choice. Their problem is that they have too little. So the stuff I'm talking about is the peculiar problem of modern  affluent  Western societies. And what is so frustrating and infuriating is this  Steve Levitt talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and difficult to install child seats don't help. It's a waste of money. What I'm telling you is that these expensive  complicated choices    it's not simply that they don't help. They actually hurt. They actually make us worse off. If some of what enables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shifted to societies in which people have too few options  not only would those people's lives be improved  but ours would be improved also  which is what economists call a  Pareto improving move.  Income redistribution will make everyone better off    not just poor people    because of how all this excess choice plagues us. So to conclude.  You can be anything you want to be    no limits  You're supposed to read this cartoon  and  being a sophisticated person  say   Ah  What does this fish know  You know  nothing is possible in this fishbowl.  Impoverished imagination  a myopic view of the world    and that's the way I read it at first. The more I thought about it  however  the more I came to the view that this fish knows something. Because the truth of the matter is that if you shatter the fishbowl so that everything is possible  you don't have freedom. You have paralysis. If you shatter this fishbowl so that everything is possible  you decrease satisfaction. You increase paralysis  and you decrease satisfaction. Everybody needs a fishbowl. This one is almost certainly too limited    perhaps even for the fish  certainly for us. But the absence of some metaphorical fishbowl is a recipe for misery  and  I suspect  disaster. Thank you very much. When you have    minutes to speak  two million years seems like a really long time. But evolutionarily  two million years is nothing. And yet in two million years  the human brain has nearly tripled in mass  going from the one and a quarter pound brain of our ancestor here  Habilis  to the almost three pound meatloaf that everybody here has between their ears. What is it about a big brain that nature was so eager for every one of us to have one  Well  it turns out when brains triple in size  they don't just get three times bigger  they gain new structures. And one of the main reasons our brain got so big is because it got a new part  called the  frontal lobe.  Particularly  a part called the  pre frontal cortex.  What does a pre frontal cortex do for you that should justify the entire architectural overhaul of the human skull in the blink of evolutionary time  It turns out the pre frontal cortex does lots of things  but one of the most important things it does is an experience simulator. Pilots practice in flight simulators so that they don't make real mistakes in planes. Human beings have this marvelous adaptation that they can actually have experiences in their heads before they try them out in real life. This is a trick that none of our ancestors could do  and that no other animal can do quite like we can. It's a marvelous adaptation. It's up there with opposable thumbs and standing upright and language as one of the things that got our species out of the trees and into the shopping mall. All of you have done this. Ben and Jerry's doesn't have liver and onion ice cream  and it's not because they whipped some up  tried it and went   Yuck.  It's because  without leaving your armchair  you can simulate that flavor and say  yuck  before you make it. Let's see how your experience simulators are working. Let's just run a quick diagnostic before I proceed with the rest of the talk. Here's two different futures that I invite you to contemplate. You can try to simulate them and tell me which one you think you might prefer. One of them is winning the lottery. This is about     million dollars. And the other is becoming paraplegic. Just give it a moment of thought. You probably don't feel like you need a moment of thought. Interestingly  there are data on these two groups of people  data on how happy they are. And this is exactly what you expected  isn't it  But these aren't the data. I made these up  These are the data. You failed the pop quiz  and you're hardly five minutes into the lecture. Because the fact is that a year after losing the use of their legs  and a year after winning the lotto  lottery winners and paraplegics are equally happy with their lives. Don't feel too bad about failing the first pop quiz  because everybody fails all of the pop quizzes all of the time. The research that my laboratory has been doing  that economists and psychologists around the country have been doing  has revealed something really quite startling to us  something we call the  impact bias   which is the tendency for the simulator to work badly. For the simulator to make you believe that different outcomes are more different than in fact they really are. From field studies to laboratory studies  we see that winning or losing an election  gaining or losing a romantic partner  getting or not getting a promotion  passing or not passing a college test  on and on  have far less impact  less intensity and much less duration than people expect them to have. This almost floors me    a recent study showing how major life traumas affect people suggests that if it happened over three months ago  with only a few exceptions  it has no impact whatsoever on your happiness. Why  Because happiness can be synthesized. Sir Thomas Brown wrote in        I am the happiest man alive. I have that in me that can convert poverty to riches  adversity to prosperity. I am more invulnerable than Achilles  fortune hath not one place to hit me.  What kind of remarkable machinery does this guy have in his head  Well  it turns out it's precisely the same remarkable machinery that all off us have. Human beings have something that we might think of as a  psychological immune system.  A system of cognitive processes  largely non conscious cognitive processes  that help them change their views of the world  so that they can feel better about the worlds in which they find themselves. Like Sir Thomas  you have this machine. Unlike Sir Thomas  you seem not to know it. We synthesize happiness  but we think happiness is a thing to be found. Now  you don't need me to give you too many examples of people synthesizing happiness  I suspect. Though I'm going to show you some experimental evidence  you don't have to look very far for evidence. As a challenge to myself  since I say this once in a while in lectures  I took a copy of the New York Times and tried to find some instances of people synthesizing happiness. Here are three guys synthesizing happiness.  I am so much better off physically  financially  emotionally  mentally and almost every other way.   I don't have one minute's regret. It was a glorious experience.   I believe it turned out for the best.  Who are these characters who are so damn happy  The first one is Jim Wright. Some of you are old enough to remember  he was the chairman of the House of Representatives and he resigned in disgrace when this young Republican named Newt Gingrich found out about a shady book deal he had done. He lost everything. The most powerful Democrat in the country lost everything. He lost his money  he lost his power. What does he have to say all these years later   I am so much better off physically  financially  mentally and in almost every other way.  What other way would there be to be better off  Vegetably  Minerally  Animally  He's pretty much covered them there. Moreese Bickham is somebody you've never heard of. Moreese Bickham uttered these words upon being released. He was    years old. He'd spent    years in a Louisiana State Penitentiary for a crime he didn't commit.  He was ultimately released for good behavior halfway through his sentence.  What did he say about his experience   I don't have one minute's regret. It was a glorious experience.  Glorious  He is not saying   Well  there were some nice guys. They had a gym.   Glorious   a word we usually reserve for something like a religious experience. Harry S. Langerman uttered these words  and he's somebody you might have known but didn't  because in      he read a little article in the paper about a hamburger stand owned by two brothers named McDonalds. And he thought   That's a really neat idea   So he went to find them. They said   We can give you a franchise on this for       bucks.  Harry went back to New York  asked his brother  an investment banker  to loan him the         and his brother's immortal words were   You idiot  nobody eats hamburgers.  He wouldn't lend him the money  and of course  six months later Ray Kroc had exactly the same idea. It turns out people do eat hamburgers  and Ray Kroc  for a while  became the richest man in America. And then finally    you know  the best of all possible worlds    some of you recognize this young photo of Pete Best  who was the original drummer for the Beatles  until they  you know  sent him out on an errand and snuck away and picked up Ringo on a tour. Well  in       when Pete Best was interviewed    yes  he's still a drummer  yes  he's a studio musician    he had this to say   I'm happier than I would have been with the Beatles.  Okay. There's something important to be learned from these people  and it is the secret of happiness. Here it is  finally to be revealed. First  accrue wealth  power  and prestige  then lose it. Second  spend as much of your life in prison as you possibly can. Third  make somebody else really  really rich. And finally  never ever join the Beatles. OK. Now I  like Ze Frank  can predict your next thought  which is   Yeah  right.  Because when people synthesize happiness  as these gentlemen seem to have done  we all smile at them  but we kind of roll our eyes and say   Yeah right  you never really wanted the job.   Oh yeah  right. You really didn't have that much in common with her  and you figured that out just about the time she threw the engagement ring in your face.  We smirk because we believe that synthetic happiness is not of the same quality as what we might call  natural happiness.  What are these terms  Natural happiness is what we get when we get what we wanted  and synthetic happiness is what we make when we don't get what we wanted. And in our society  we have a strong belief that synthetic happiness is of an inferior kind. Why do we have that belief  Well  it's very simple. What kind of economic engine would keep churning if we believed that not getting what we want could make us just as happy as getting it  With all apologies to my friend Matthieu Ricard  a shopping mall full of Zen monks is not going to be particularly profitable  because they don't want stuff enough. I want to suggest to you that synthetic happiness is every bit as real and enduring as the kind of happiness you stumble upon when you get exactly what you were aiming for. I'm a scientist  so I'm going to do this not with rhetoric  but by marinating you in a little bit of data. Let me first show you an experimental paradigm that is used to demonstrate the synthesis of happiness among regular old folks. And this isn't mine. It's a    year old paradigm called the  free choice paradigm.  It's very simple. You bring in  say  six objects  and you ask a subject to rank them from the most to the least liked. In this case  because this experiment uses them  these are Monet prints. So  everybody can rank these Monet prints from the one they like the most  to the one they like the least. Now we give you a choice   We happen to have some extra prints in the closet. We're going to give you one as your prize to take home. We happen to have number three and number four   we tell the subject. This is a bit of a difficult choice  because neither one is preferred strongly to the other  but naturally  people tend to pick number three because they liked it a little better than number four. Sometime later    it could be    minutes  it could be    days    the same stimuli are put before the subject  and the subject is asked to re rank the stimuli.  Tell us how much you like them now.  What happens  Watch as happiness is synthesized. This is the result that has been replicated over and over again. You're watching happiness be synthesized. Would you like to see it again  Happiness   The one I got is really better than I thought  That other one I didn't get sucks   That's the synthesis of happiness. Now  what's the right response to that   Yeah  right   Now  here's the experiment we did  and I hope this is going to convince you that  Yeah  right   was not the right response. We did this experiment with a group of patients who had anterograde amnesia. These are hospitalized patients. Most of them have Korsakoff's syndrome  a polyneuritic psychosis. They drank way too much  and they can't make new memories. OK  They remember their childhood  but if you walk in and introduce yourself  and then leave the room  when you come back  they don't know who you are. We took our Monet prints to the hospital. And we asked these patients to rank them from the one they liked the most to the one they liked the least. We then gave them the choice between number three and number four. Like everybody else  they said   Gee  thanks Doc  That's great  I could use a new print. I'll take number three.  We explained we would have number three mailed to them. We gathered up our materials and we went out of the room  and counted to a half hour. Back into the room  we say   Hi  we're back.  The patients  bless them  say   Ah  Doc  I'm sorry  I've got a memory problem  that's why I'm here. If I've met you before  I don't remember.   Really  you don't remember  I was just here with the Monet prints    Sorry  Doc  I just don't have a clue.   No problem  Jim. All I want you to do is rank these for me from the one you like the most to the one you like the least.  What do they do  Well  let's first check and make sure they're really amnesiac. We ask these amnesiac patients to tell us which one they own  which one they chose last time  which one is theirs. And what we find is amnesiac patients just guess. These are normal controls  where if I did this with you  all of you would know which print you chose. But if I do this with amnesiac patients  they don't have a clue. They can't pick their print out of a lineup. Here's what normal controls do  they synthesize happiness. Right  This is the change in liking score  the change from the first time they ranked to the second time they ranked. Normal controls show    that was the magic I showed you  now I'm showing it to you in graphical form     The one I own is better than I thought. The one I didn't own  the one I left behind  is not as good as I thought.  Amnesiacs do exactly the same thing. Think about this result. These people like better the one they own  but they don't know they own it.  Yeah  right  is not the right response  What these people did when they synthesized happiness is they really  truly changed their affective  hedonic  aesthetic reactions to that poster. They're not just saying it because they own it  because they don't know they own it. Now  when psychologists show you bars  you know that they are showing you averages of lots of people. And yet  all of us have this psychological immune system  this capacity to synthesize happiness  but some of us do this trick better than others. And some situations allow anybody to do it more effectively than other situations do. It turns out that freedom    the ability to make up your mind and change your mind    is the friend of natural happiness  because it allows you to choose among all those delicious futures and find the one that you would most enjoy. But freedom to choose  to change and make up your mind  is the enemy of synthetic happiness. And I'm going to show you why. Dilbert already knows  of course. You're reading as I'm talking.  Dogbert's tech support. How may I abuse you    My printer prints a blank page after every document.   Why complain about getting free paper    Free  Aren't you just giving me my own paper    Look at the quality of the free paper compared to your lousy regular paper  Only a fool or a liar would say that they look the same    Now that you mention it  it does seem a little silkier    What are you doing    I'm helping people accept the things they cannot change.  Indeed. The psychological immune system works best when we are totally stuck  when we are trapped. This is the difference between dating and marriage. You go out on a date with a guy  and he picks his nose  you don't go out on another date. You're married to a guy and he picks his nose  He has a heart of gold. Don't touch the fruitcake  You find a way to be happy with what's happened. Now  what I want to show you is that people don't know this about themselves  and not knowing this can work to our supreme disadvantage. Here's an experiment we did at Harvard. We created a black and white photography course  and we allowed students to come in and learn how to use a darkroom. So we gave them cameras  they went around campus  they took    pictures of their favorite professors and their dorm room and their dog  and all the other things they wanted to have Harvard memories of. They bring us the camera  we make up a contact sheet  they figure out which are the two best pictures  and we now spend six hours teaching them about darkrooms. And they blow two of them up  and they have two gorgeous eight by    glossies of meaningful things to them  and we say   Which one would you like to give up   They say   I have to give one up    Yes  we need one as evidence of the class project. So you have to give me one. You have to make a choice. You get to keep one  and I get to keep one.  Now  there are two conditions in this experiment. In one case  the students are told   But you know  if you want to change your mind  I'll always have the other one here  and in the next four days  before I actually mail it to headquarters      yeah   headquarters      I'll be glad to swap it out with you. In fact  I'll come to your dorm room  just give me an email. Better yet  I'll check with you. You ever want to change your mind  it's totally returnable.  The other half of the students are told exactly the opposite   Make your choice  and by the way  the mail is going out  gosh  in two minutes  to England. Your picture will be winging its way over the Atlantic. You will never see it again.  Half of the students in each of these conditions are asked to make predictions about how much they're going to come to like the picture that they keep and the picture they leave behind. Other students are just sent back to their little dorm rooms and they are measured over the next three to six days on their liking  satisfaction with the pictures. And look at what we find. First of all  here's what students think is going to happen. They think they're going to maybe come to like the picture they chose a little more than the one they left behind  but these are not statistically significant differences. It's a very small increase  and it doesn't much matter whether they were in the reversible or irreversible condition. Wrong o. Bad simulators. Because here's what's really happening. Both right before the swap and five days later  people who are stuck with that picture  who have no choice  who can never change their mind  like it a lot  And people who are deliberating     Should I return it  Have I gotten the right one  Maybe this isn't the good one  Maybe I left the good one      have killed themselves. They don't like their picture  and in fact even after the opportunity to swap has expired  they still don't like their picture. Why  Because the  reversible  condition is not conducive to the synthesis of happiness. So here's the final piece of this experiment. We bring in a whole new group of naive Harvard students and we say   You know  we're doing a photography course  and we can do it one of two ways. We could do it so that when you take the two pictures  you'd have four days to change your mind  or we're doing another course where you take the two pictures and you make up your mind right away and you can never change it. Which course would you like to be in   Duh     percent of the students  two thirds  prefer to be in the course where they have the opportunity to change their mind. Hello     percent of the students choose to be in the course in which they will ultimately be deeply dissatisfied with the picture. Because they do not know the conditions under which synthetic happiness grows. The Bard said everything best  of course  and he's making my point here but he's making it hyperbolically   'Tis nothing good or bad   But thinking makes it so.  It's nice poetry  but that can't exactly be right. Is there really nothing good or bad  Is it really the case that gall bladder surgery and a trip to Paris are just the same thing  That seems like a one question IQ test. They can't be exactly the same. In more turgid prose  but closer to the truth  was the father of modern capitalism  Adam Smith  and he said this. This is worth contemplating   The great source of both the misery and disorders of human life seems to arise from overrating the difference between one permanent situation and another    Some of these situations may  no doubt  deserve to be preferred to others  but none of them can deserve to be pursued with that passionate ardor which drives us to violate the rules either of prudence or of justice  or to corrupt the future tranquility of our minds  either by shame from the remembrance of our own folly  or by remorse for the horror of our own injustice.  In other words  yes  some things are better than others. We should have preferences that lead us into one future over another. But when those preferences drive us too hard and too fast because we have overrated the difference between these futures  we are at risk. When our ambition is bounded  it leads us to work joyfully. When our ambition is unbounded  it leads us to lie  to cheat  to steal  to hurt others  to sacrifice things of real value. When our fears are bounded  we're prudent  we're cautious  we're thoughtful. When our fears are unbounded and overblown  we're reckless  and we're cowardly. The lesson I want to leave you with  from these data  is that our longings and our worries are both to some degree overblown  because we have within us the capacity to manufacture the very commodity we are constantly chasing when we choose experience. Thank you. Thank you. It's really an honor and a privilege to be here spending my last day as a teenager. Today I want to talk to you about the future  but first I'm going to tell you a bit about the past. My story starts way before I was born. My grandmother was on a train to Auschwitz  the death camp. And she was going along the tracks  and the tracks split. And somehow    we don't really know exactly the whole story    but the train took the wrong track and went to a work camp rather than the death camp. My grandmother survived and married my grandfather. They were living in Hungary  and my mother was born. And when my mother was two years old  the Hungarian revolution was raging  and they decided to escape Hungary. They got on a boat  and yet another divergence    the boat was either going to Canada or to Australia. They got on and didn't know where they were going  and ended up in Canada. So  to make a long story short  they came to Canada. My grandmother was a chemist. She worked at the Banting Institute in Toronto  and at    she died of stomach cancer. I never met my grandmother  but I carry on her name    her exact name  Eva Vertes    and I like to think I carry on her scientific passion  too. I found this passion not far from here  actually  when I was nine years old. My family was on a road trip and we were in the Grand Canyon. And I had never been a reader when I was young    my dad had tried me with the Hardy Boys  I tried Nancy Drew  I tried all that    and I just didn't like reading books. And my mother bought this book when we were at the Grand Canyon called  The Hot Zone.  It was all about the outbreak of the Ebola virus. And something about it just kind of drew me towards it. There was this big sort of bumpy looking virus on the cover  and I just wanted to read it. I picked up that book  and as we drove from the edge of the Grand Canyon to Big Sur  and to  actually  here where we are today  in Monterey  I read that book  and from when I was reading that book  I knew that I wanted to have a life in medicine. I wanted to be like the explorers I'd read about in the book  who went into the jungles of Africa  went into the research labs and just tried to figure out what this deadly virus was. So from that moment on  I read every medical book I could get my hands on  and I just loved it so much. I was a passive observer of the medical world. It wasn't until I entered high school that I thought   Maybe now  you know    being a big high school kid    I can maybe become an active part of this big medical world.  I was     and I emailed professors at the local university to see if maybe I could go work in their lab. And hardly anyone responded. But I mean  why would they respond to a    year old  anyway  And I got to go talk to one professor  Dr. Jacobs  who accepted me into the lab. At that time  I was really interested in neuroscience and wanted to do a research project in neurology    specifically looking at the effects of heavy metals on the developing nervous system. So I started that  and worked in his lab for a year  and found the results that I guess you'd expect to find when you feed fruit flies heavy metals    that it really  really impaired the nervous system. The spinal cord had breaks. The neurons were crossing in every which way. And from then I wanted to look not at impairment  but at prevention of impairment. So that's what led me to Alzheimer's. I started reading about Alzheimer's and tried to familiarize myself with the research  and at the same time when I was in the    I was reading in the medical library one day  and I read this article about something called  purine derivatives.  And they seemed to have cell growth promoting properties. And being naive about the whole field  I kind of thought   Oh  you have cell death in Alzheimer's which is causing the memory deficit  and then you have this compound    purine derivatives    that are promoting cell growth.  And so I thought   Maybe if it can promote cell growth  it can inhibit cell death  too.  And so that's the project that I pursued for that year  and it's continuing now as well  and found that a specific purine derivative called  guanidine  had inhibited the cell growth by approximately    percent. So I presented those results at the International Science Fair  which was just one of the most amazing experiences of my life. And there I was awarded  Best in the World in Medicine   which allowed me to get in  or at least get a foot in the door of the big medical world. And from then on  since I was now in this huge exciting world  I wanted to explore it all. I wanted it all at once  but knew I couldn't really get that. And I stumbled across something called  cancer stem cells.  And this is really what I want to talk to you about today    about cancer. At first when I heard of cancer stem cells  I didn't really know how to put the two together. I'd heard of stem cells  and I'd heard of them as the panacea of the future    the therapy of many diseases to come in the future  perhaps. But I'd heard of cancer as the most feared disease of our time  so how did the good and bad go together  Last summer I worked at Stanford University  doing some research on cancer stem cells. And while I was doing this  I was reading the cancer literature  trying to    again    familiarize myself with this new medical field. And it seemed that tumors actually begin from a stem cell. This fascinated me. The more I read  the more I looked at cancer differently and almost became less fearful of it. It seems that cancer is a direct result to injury. If you smoke  you damage your lung tissue  and then lung cancer arises. If you drink  you damage your liver  and then liver cancer occurs. And it was really interesting    there were articles correlating if you have a bone fracture  and then bone cancer arises. Because what stem cells are    they're these phenomenal cells that really have the ability to differentiate into any type of tissue. So  if the body is sensing that you have damage to an organ and then it's initiating cancer  it's almost as if this is a repair response. And the cancer  the body is saying the lung tissue is damaged  we need to repair the lung. And cancer is originating in the lung trying to repair    because you have this excessive proliferation of these remarkable cells that really have the potential to become lung tissue. But it's almost as if the body has originated this ingenious response  but can't quite control it. It hasn't yet become fine tuned enough to finish what has been initiated. So this really  really fascinated me. And I really think that we can't think about cancer    let alone any disease    in such black and white terms. If we eliminate cancer the way we're trying to do now  with chemotherapy and radiation  we're bombarding the body or the cancer with toxins  or with radiation  trying to kill it. It's almost as if we're getting back to this starting point. We're removing the cancer cells  but we're revealing the previous damage that the body has tried to fix. Shouldn't we think about manipulation  rather than elimination  If somehow we can cause these cells to differentiate    to become bone tissue  lung tissue  liver tissue  whatever that cancer has been put there to do    it would be a repair process. We'd end up better than we were before cancer. So  this really changed my view of looking at cancer. And while I was reading all these articles about cancer  it seemed that the articles    a lot of them    focused on  you know  the genetics of breast cancer  and the genesis and the progression of breast cancer    tracking the cancer through the body  tracing where it is  where it goes. But it struck me that I'd never heard of cancer of the heart  or cancer of any skeletal muscle for that matter. And skeletal muscle constitutes    percent of our body  or over    percent of our body. And so at first I kind of thought   Well  maybe there's some obvious explanation why skeletal muscle doesn't get cancer    at least not that I know of.  So  I looked further into it  found as many articles as I could  and it was amazing    because it turned out that it was very rare. Some articles even went as far as to say that skeletal muscle tissue is resistant to cancer  and furthermore  not only to cancer  but of metastases going to skeletal muscle. And what metastases are is when the tumor    when a piece    breaks off and travels through the blood stream and goes to a different organ. That's what a metastasis is. It's the part of cancer that is the most dangerous. If cancer was localized  we could likely remove it  or somehow    you know  it's contained. It's very contained. But once it starts moving throughout the body  that's when it becomes deadly. So the fact that not only did cancer not seem to originate in skeletal muscles  but cancer didn't seem to go to skeletal muscle    there seemed to be something here. So these articles were saying  you know   Skeletal    metastasis to skeletal muscle    is very rare.  But it was left at that. No one seemed to be asking why. So I decided to ask why. At first    the first thing I did was I emailed some professors who specialized in skeletal muscle physiology  and pretty much said   Hey  it seems like cancer doesn't really go to skeletal muscle. Is there a reason for this   And a lot of the replies I got were that muscle is terminally differentiated tissue. Meaning that you have muscle cells  but they're not dividing  so it doesn't seem like a good target for cancer to hijack. But then again  this fact that the metastases didn't go to skeletal muscle made that seem unlikely. And furthermore  that nervous tissue    brain    gets cancer  and brain cells are also terminally differentiated. So I decided to ask why. And here's some of  I guess  my hypotheses that I'll be starting to investigate this May at the Sylvester Cancer Institute in Miami. And I guess I'll keep investigating until I get the answers. But I know that in science  once you get the answers  inevitably you're going to have more questions. So I guess you could say that I'll probably be doing this for the rest of my life. Some of my hypotheses are that when you first think about skeletal muscle  there's a lot of blood vessels going to skeletal muscle. And the first thing that makes me think is that blood vessels are like highways for the tumor cells. Tumor cells can travel through the blood vessels. And you think  the more highways there are in a tissue  the more likely it is to get cancer or to get metastases. So first of all I thought  you know   Wouldn't it be favorable to cancer getting to skeletal muscle   And as well  cancer tumors require a process called angiogenesis  which is really  the tumor recruits the blood vessels to itself to supply itself with nutrients so it can grow. Without angiogenesis  the tumor remains the size of a pinpoint and it's not harmful. So angiogenesis is really a central process to the pathogenesis of cancer. And one article that really stood out to me when I was just reading about this  trying to figure out why cancer doesn't go to skeletal muscle  was that it had reported    percent of micro metastases to skeletal muscle upon autopsy.    percent  Meaning that there were these pinpoint tumors in skeletal muscle  but only .   percent of actual metastases    suggesting that maybe skeletal muscle is able to control the angiogenesis  is able to control the tumors recruiting these blood vessels. We use skeletal muscles so much. It's the one portion of our body    our heart's always beating. We're always moving our muscles. Is it possible that muscle somehow intuitively knows that it needs this blood supply  It needs to be constantly contracting  so therefore it's almost selfish. It's grabbing its blood vessels for itself. Therefore  when a tumor comes into skeletal muscle tissue  it can't get a blood supply  and can't grow. So this suggests that maybe if there is an anti angiogenic factor in skeletal muscle    or perhaps even more  an angiogenic routing factor  so it can actually direct where the blood vessels grow    this could be a potential future therapy for cancer. And another thing that's really interesting is that there's this whole    the way tumors move throughout the body  it's a very complex system    and there's something called the chemokine network. And chemokines are essentially chemical attractants  and they're the stop and go signals for cancer. So a tumor expresses chemokine receptors  and another organ    a distant organ somewhere in the body    will have the corresponding chemokines  and the tumor will see these chemokines and migrate towards it. Is it possible that skeletal muscle doesn't express this type of molecules  And the other really interesting thing is that when skeletal muscle    there's been several reports that when skeletal muscle is injured  that's what correlates with metastases going to skeletal muscle. And  furthermore  when skeletal muscle is injured  that's what causes chemokines    these signals saying   Cancer  you can come to me   the  go signs  for the tumors    it causes them to highly express these chemokines. So  there's so much interplay here. I mean  there are so many possibilities for why tumors don't go to skeletal muscle. But it seems like by investigating  by attacking cancer  by searching where cancer is not  there has got to be something    there's got to be something    that's making this tissue resistant to tumors. And can we utilize    can we take this property  this compound  this receptor  whatever it is that's controlling these anti tumor properties and apply it to cancer therapy in general  Now  one thing that kind of ties the resistance of skeletal muscle to cancer    to the cancer as a repair response gone out of control in the body    is that skeletal muscle has a factor in it called  MyoD.  And what MyoD essentially does is  it causes cells to differentiate into muscle cells. So this compound  MyoD  has been tested on a lot of different cell types and been shown to actually convert this variety of cell types into skeletal muscle cells. So  is it possible that the tumor cells are going to the skeletal muscle tissue  but once in contact inside the skeletal muscle tissue  MyoD acts upon these tumor cells and causes them to become skeletal muscle cells  Maybe tumor cells are being disguised as skeletal muscle cells  and this is why it seems as if it is so rare. It's not harmful  it has just repaired the muscle. Muscle is constantly being used    constantly being damaged. If every time we tore a muscle or every time we stretched a muscle or moved in a wrong way  cancer occurred    I mean  everybody would have cancer almost. And I hate to say that. But it seems as though muscle cell  possibly because of all its use  has adapted faster than other body tissues to respond to injury  to fine tune this repair response and actually be able to finish the process which the body wants to finish. I really believe that the human body is very  very smart  and we can't counteract something the body is saying to do. It's different when a bacteria comes into the body    that's a foreign object    we want that out. But when the body is actually initiating a process and we're calling it a disease  it doesn't seem as though elimination is the right solution. So even to go from there  it's possible  although far fetched  that in the future we could almost think of cancer being used as a therapy. If those diseases where tissues are deteriorating    for example Alzheimer's  where the brain  the brain cells  die and we need to restore new brain cells  new functional brain cells    what if we could  in the future  use cancer  A tumor    put it in the brain and cause it to differentiate into brain cells  That's a very far fetched idea  but I really believe that it may be possible. These cells are so versatile  these cancer cells are so versatile    we just have to manipulate them in the right way. And again  some of these may be far fetched  but I figured if there's anywhere to present far fetched ideas  it's here at TED  so thank you very much.    minutes is an absolutely brutal time limit  so I'm going to dive straight in  right at the point where I get this thing to work. Here we go. I'm going to talk about five different things. I'm going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable. I'm going to talk about why we have to get our shit together  and actually talk about this a bit more than we do. I'm going to talk about feasibility as well  of course. I'm going to talk about why we are so fatalistic about doing anything about aging. And then I'm going spend perhaps the second half of the talk talking about  you know  how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong  namely  by actually doing something about it. I'm going to do that in two steps. The first one I'm going to talk about is how to get from a relatively modest amount of life extension    which I'm going to define as    years  applied to people who are already in middle age when you start    to a point which can genuinely be called defeating aging. Namely  essentially an elimination of the relationship between how old you are and how likely you are to die in the next year    or indeed  to get sick in the first place. And of course  the last thing I'm going to talk about is how to reach that intermediate step  that point of maybe    years life extension. So I'm going to start with why we should. Now  I want to ask a question. Hands up  anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria  That was easy. OK. OK. Hands up  anyone in the audience who's not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing  OK. So we all think malaria is a bad thing. That's very good news  because I thought that was what the answer would be. Now the thing is  I would like to put it to you that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging. And here is that characteristic. The only real difference is that aging kills considerably more people than malaria does. Now  I like in an audience  in Britain especially  to talk about the comparison with foxhunting  which is something that was banned after a long struggle  by the government not very many months ago. I mean  I know I'm with a sympathetic audience here  but  as we know  a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic. And this is actually a rather good comparison  it seems to me. You know  a lot of people said   Well  you know  city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time. It's a traditional part of the way of life  and we should be allowed to carry on doing it. It's ecologically sound  it stops the population explosion of foxes.  But ultimately  the government prevailed in the end  because the majority of the British public  and certainly the majority of members of Parliament  came to the conclusion that it was really something that should not be tolerated in a civilized society. And I think that human aging shares all of these characteristics in spades. What part of this do people not understand  It's not just about life  of course    it's about healthy life  you know    getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun  whether or not dying may be fun. So really  this is how I would like to describe it. It's a global trance. These are the sorts of unbelievable excuses that people give for aging. And  I mean  OK  I'm not actually saying that these excuses are completely valueless. There are some good points to be made here  things that we ought to be thinking about  forward planning so that nothing goes too    well  so that we minimize the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging. But these are completely crazy  when you actually remember your sense of proportion. You know  these are arguments  these are things that would be legitimate to be concerned about. But the question is  are they so dangerous    these risks of doing something about aging    that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite  namely  leaving aging as it is  Are these so bad that they outweigh condemning         people a day to an unnecessarily early death  You know  if you haven't got an argument that's that strong  then just don't waste my time  is what I say. Now  there is one argument that some people do think really is that strong  and here it is. People worry about overpopulation  they say   Well  if we fix aging  no one's going to die to speak of  or at least the death toll is going to be much lower  only from crossing St. Giles carelessly. And therefore  we're not going to be able to have many kids  and kids are really important to most people.  And that's true. And you know  a lot of people try to fudge this question  and give answers like this. I don't agree with those answers. I think they basically don't work. I think it's true  that we will face a dilemma in this respect. We will have to decide whether to have a low birth rate  or a high death rate. A high death rate will  of course  arise from simply rejecting these therapies  in favor of carrying on having a lot of kids. And  I say that that's fine    the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice. What's not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future. If we vacillate  hesitate  and do not actually develop these therapies  then we are condemning a whole cohort of people    who would have been young enough and healthy enough to benefit from those therapies  but will not be  because we haven't developed them as quickly as we could    we'll be denying those people an indefinite life span  and I consider that that is immoral. That's my answer to the overpopulation question. Right. So the next thing is  now why should we get a little bit more active on this  And the fundamental answer is that the pro aging trance is not as dumb as it looks. It's actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging. Aging is ghastly  but it's inevitable  so  you know  we've got to find some way to put it out of our minds  and it's rational to do anything that we might want to do  to do that. Like  for example  making up these ridiculous reasons why aging is actually a good thing after all. But of course  that only works when we have both of these components. And as soon as the inevitability bit becomes a little bit unclear    and we might be in range of doing something about aging    this becomes part of the problem. This pro aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things. And that's why we have to really talk about this a lot    evangelize  I will go so far as to say  quite a lot    in order to get people's attention  and make people realize that they are in a trance in this regard. So that's all I'm going to say about that. I'm now going to talk about feasibility. And the fundamental reason  I think  why we feel that aging is inevitable is summed up in a definition of aging that I'm giving here. A very simple definition. Aging is a side effect of being alive in the first place  which is to say  metabolism. This is not a completely tautological statement  it's a reasonable statement. Aging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars  and it also happens to us  despite the fact that we have a lot of clever self repair mechanisms  because those self repair mechanisms are not perfect. So basically  metabolism  which is defined as basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next  has side effects. Those side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology. That's a fine definition. So we can put it this way  we can say that  you know  we have this chain of events. And there are really two games in town  according to most people  with regard to postponing aging. They're what I'm calling here the  gerontology approach  and the  geriatrics approach.  The geriatrician will intervene late in the day  when pathology is becoming evident  and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time  and stop the accumulation of side effects from causing the pathology quite so soon. Of course  it's a very short term ist strategy  it's a losing battle  because the things that are causing the pathology are becoming more abundant as time goes on. The gerontology approach looks much more promising on the surface  because  you know  prevention is better than cure. But unfortunately the thing is that we don't understand metabolism very well. In fact  we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work    even cells we're not really too good on yet. We've discovered things like  for example  RNA interference only a few years ago  and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work. Basically  gerontology is a fine approach in the end  but it is not an approach whose time has come when we're talking about intervention. So then  what do we do about that  I mean  that's a fine logic  that sounds pretty convincing  pretty ironclad  doesn't it  But it isn't. Before I tell you why it isn't  I'm going to go a little bit into what I'm calling step two. Just suppose  as I said  that we do acquire    let's say we do it today for the sake of argument    the ability to confer    extra years of healthy life on people who are already in middle age  let's say   . I'm going to call that  robust human rejuvenation.  OK. What would that actually mean for how long people of various ages today    or equivalently  of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive    would actually live  In order to answer that question    you might think it's simple  but it's not simple. We can't just say   Well  if they're young enough to benefit from these therapies  then they'll live    years longer.  That's the wrong answer. And the reason it's the wrong answer is because of progress. There are two sorts of technological progress really  for this purpose. There are fundamental  major breakthroughs  and there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughs. Now  they differ a great deal in terms of the predictability of time frames. Fundamental breakthroughs  very hard to predict how long it's going to take to make a fundamental breakthrough. It was a very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun  and it took us until      to actually work out how to do it. But after that  things were pretty steady and pretty uniform. I think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened in the progression of the technology of powered flight. We can think  really  that each one is sort of beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one  if you like. The incremental advances have added up to something which is not incremental anymore. This is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough. And you see it in all sorts of technologies. Computers  you can look at a more or less parallel time line  happening of course a bit later. You can look at medical care. I mean  hygiene  vaccines  antibiotics    you know  the same sort of time frame. So I think that actually step two  that I called a step a moment ago  isn't a step at all. That in fact  the people who are young enough to benefit from these first therapies that give this moderate amount of life extension  even though those people are already middle aged when the therapies arrive  will be at some sort of cusp. They will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments that will give them a further    or maybe    years. In other words  they will be staying ahead of the game. The therapies will be improving faster than the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us. This is a very important point for me to get across. Because  you know  most people  when they hear that I predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to       or more  they think that I'm saying that we're going to invent therapies in the next few decades that are so thoroughly eliminating aging that those therapies will let us live to       or more. I'm not saying that at all. I'm saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies will be enough. They'll never be perfect  but we'll be able to fix the things that     year olds die of  before we have any     year olds. And the same for     and     and so on. I decided to give this a little name  which is  longevity escape velocity.  Well  it seems to get the point across. So  these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live  in terms of remaining life expectancy  as measured by their health  for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive. If you're already      or even if you're       and an average    year old  we probably can't do a lot for you with these therapies  because you're too close to death's door for the really initial  experimental therapies to be good enough for you. You won't be able to withstand them. But if you're only     then there's a chance that you might be able to pull out of the dive and  you know    eventually get through this and start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense  in terms of your youthfulness  both physical and mental  and in terms of your risk of death from age related causes. And of course  if you're a bit younger than that  then you're never really even going to get near to being fragile enough to die of age related causes. So this is a genuine conclusion that I come to  that the first     year old    we don't know how old that person is today  because we don't know how long it's going to take to get these first generation therapies. But irrespective of that age  I'm claiming that the first person to live to          subject of course  to  you know  global catastrophes    is actually  probably  only about    years younger than the first     year old. And that's quite a thought. Alright  so finally I'm going to spend the rest of the talk  my last seven and a half minutes  on step one  namely  how do we actually get to this moderate amount of life extension that will allow us to get to escape velocity  And in order to do that  I need to talk about mice a little bit. I have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation. I'm calling it  robust mouse rejuvenation   not very imaginatively. And this is what it is. I say we're going to take a long lived strain of mouse  which basically means mice that live about three years on average. We do exactly nothing to them until they're already two years old. And then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them  and with those therapies  we get them to live  on average  to their fifth birthday. So  in other words  we add two years    we treble their remaining lifespan  starting from the point that we started the therapies. The question then is  what would that actually mean for the time frame until we get to the milestone I talked about earlier for humans  Which we can now  as I've explained  equivalently call either robust human rejuvenation or longevity escape velocity. Secondly  what does it mean for the public's perception of how long it's going to take for us to get to those things  starting from the time we get the mice  And thirdly  the question is  what will it do to actually how much people want it  And it seems to me that the first question is entirely a biology question  and it's extremely hard to answer. One has to be very speculative  and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation  that we should simply keep our counsel until we know more. I say that's nonsense. I say we absolutely are irresponsible if we stay silent on this. We need to give our best guess as to the time frame  in order to give people a sense of proportion so that they can assess their priorities. So  I say that we have a       chance of reaching this RHR milestone  robust human rejuvenation  within    years from the point that we get to robust mouse rejuvenation.    years from the robust mouse. The public's perception will probably be somewhat better than that. The public tends to underestimate how difficult scientific things are. So they'll probably think it's five years away. They'll be wrong  but that actually won't matter too much. And finally  of course  I think it's fair to say that a large part of the reason why the public is so ambivalent about aging now is the global trance I spoke about earlier  the coping strategy. That will be history at this point  because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans  since it's been postponed so very effectively in mice. So we're likely to end up with a very strong change in people's attitudes  and of course that has enormous implications. So in order to tell you now how we're going to get these mice  I'm going to add a little bit to my description of aging. I'm going to use this word  damage  to denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism and that eventually cause pathology. Because the critical thing about this is that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology  the damage itself is caused ongoing ly throughout life  starting before we're born. But it is not part of metabolism itself. And this turns out to be useful. Because we can re draw our original diagram this way. We can say that  fundamentally  the difference between gerontology and geriatrics is that gerontology tries to inhibit the rate at which metabolism lays down this damage. And I'm going to explain exactly what damage is in concrete biological terms in a moment. And geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time by stopping the damage converting into pathology. And the reason it's a losing battle is because the damage is continuing to accumulate. So there's a third approach  if we look at it this way. We can call it the  engineering approach   and I claim that the engineering approach is within range. The engineering approach does not intervene in any processes. It does not intervene in this process or this one. And that's good because it means that it's not a losing battle  and it's something that we are within range of being able to do  because it doesn't involve improving on evolution. The engineering approach simply says   Let's go and periodically repair all of these various types of damage    not necessarily repair them completely  but repair them quite a lot  so that we keep the level of damage down below the threshold that must exist  that causes it to be pathogenic.  We know that this threshold exists  because we don't get age related diseases until we're in middle age  even though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born. Why do I say that we're in range  Well  this is basically it. The point about this slide is actually the bottom. If we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging  we will be here all night  because basically all of metabolism is important for aging in one way or another. This list is just for illustration  it is incomplete. The list on the right is also incomplete. It's a list of types of pathology that are age related  and it's just an incomplete list. But I would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually complete    this is the list of types of thing that qualify as damage  side effects of metabolism that cause pathology in the end  or that might cause pathology. And there are only seven of them. They're categories of things  of course  but there's only seven of them. Cell loss  mutations in chromosomes  mutations in the mitochondria and so on. First of all  I'd like to give you an argument for why that list is complete. Of course one can make a biological argument. One can say   OK  what are we made of   We're made of cells and stuff between cells. What can damage accumulate in  The answer is  long lived molecules  because if a short lived molecule undergoes damage  but then the molecule is destroyed    like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis    then the damage is gone  too. It's got to be long lived molecules. So  these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago and that is pretty good news  because it means that  you know  we've come a long way in biology in these    years  so the fact that we haven't extended this list is a pretty good indication that there's no extension to be done. However  it's better than that  we actually know how to fix them all  in mice  in principle    and what I mean by in principle is  we probably can actually implement these fixes within a decade. Some of them are partially implemented already  the ones at the top. I haven't got time to go through them at all  but my conclusion is that  if we can actually get suitable funding for this  then we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only    years  but we do need to get serious about it. We do need to really start trying. So of course  there are some biologists in the audience  and I want to give some answers to some of the questions that you may have. You may have been dissatisfied with this talk  but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff. I've published a great deal on this  I cite the experimental work on which my optimism is based  and there's quite a lot of detail there. The detail is what makes me confident of my rather aggressive time frames that I'm predicting here. So if you think that I'm wrong  you'd better damn well go and find out why you think I'm wrong. And of course the main thing is that you shouldn't trust people who call themselves gerontologists because  as with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field  you know  you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant and not really to take it seriously. So  you know  you've got to actually do your homework  in order to understand whether this is true. And we'll just end with a few things. One thing is  you know  you'll be hearing from a guy in the next session who said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in half no time  and everyone said   Well  it's obviously impossible.  And you know what happened. So  you know  this does happen. We have various strategies    there's the Methuselah Mouse Prize  which is basically an incentive to innovate  and to do what you think is going to work  and you get money for it if you win. There's a proposal to actually put together an institute. This is what's going to take a bit of money. But  I mean  look    how long does it take to spend that on the war in Iraq  Not very long. OK. It's got to be philanthropic  because profits distract biotech  but it's basically got a    percent chance  I think  of succeeding in this. And I think we know how to do it. And I'll stop there. Thank you. Chris Anderson  OK. I don't know if there's going to be any questions but I thought I would give people the chance. Audience  Since you've been talking about aging and trying to defeat it  why is it that you make yourself appear like an old man  AG  Because I am an old man. I am actually    . Audience  Species on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate. However  as far as I know  all the species have evolved to actually die  so when cells divide  the telomerase get shorter  and eventually species die. So  why does    evolution has    seems to have selected against immortality  when it is so advantageous  or is evolution just incomplete  AG  Brilliant. Thank you for asking a question that I can answer with an uncontroversial answer. I'm going to tell you the genuine mainstream answer to your question  which I happen to agree with  which is that  no  aging is not a product of selection  evolution   aging  is simply a product of evolutionary neglect. In other words  we have aging because it's hard work not to have aging  you need more genetic pathways  more sophistication in your genes in order to age more slowly  and that carries on being true the longer you push it out. So  to the extent that evolution doesn't matter  doesn't care whether genes are passed on by individuals  living a long time or by procreation  there's a certain amount of modulation of that  which is why different species have different lifespans  but that's why there are no immortal species. CA  The genes don't care but we do  AG  That's right. Audience  Hello. I read somewhere that in the last    years  the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by    years. If I project that  that would make me think that I would live until     if I don't crash on my motorbike. That means that I'm one of your subjects to become a       year old  AG  If you lose a bit of weight. Your numbers are a bit out. The standard numbers are that lifespans have been growing at between one and two years per decade. So  it's not quite as good as you might think  you might hope. But I intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possible. Audience  I was told that many of the brain cells we have as adults are actually in the human embryo  and that the brain cells last    years or so. If that is indeed true  biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation  If there are cells in my body that live all    years  as opposed to a typical  you know  couple of months  AG  There are technical implications certainly. Basically what we need to do is replace cells in those few areas of the brain that lose cells at a respectable rate  especially neurons  but we don't want to replace them any faster than that    or not much faster anyway  because replacing them too fast would degrade cognitive function. What I said about there being no non aging species earlier on was a little bit of an oversimplification. There are species that have no aging    Hydra for example    but they do it by not having a nervous system    and not having any tissues in fact that rely for their function on very long lived cells. I'll just take you to Bangladesh for a minute. Before I tell that story  we should ask ourselves the question  Why does poverty exist  I mean  there is plenty of knowledge and scientific breakthroughs. We all live in the same planet  but there's still a great deal of poverty in the world. And I think    so I want to throw a perspective that I have  so that we can assess this project  or any other project  for that matter  to see whether it's contributing or    contributing to poverty or trying to alleviate it. Rich countries have been sending aid to poor countries for the last    years. And by and large  this has failed. And you can see this book  written by someone who worked in the World Bank for    years  and he finds economic growth in this country to be elusive. By and large  it did not work. So the question is  why is that  In my mind  there is something to learn from the history of Europe. I mean  even here  yesterday I was walking across the street  and they showed three bishops were executed     years ago  right across the street from here. So my point is  there's a lot of struggle has gone in Europe  where citizens were empowered by technologies. And they demanded authorities from    to come down from their high horses. And in the end  there's better bargaining between the authorities and citizens  and democracies  capitalism    everything else flourished. And so you can see  the real process of    and this is backed up by this     page book    that the authorities came down and citizens got up. But if you look  if you have that perspective  then you can see what happened in the last    years. Aid actually did the opposite. It empowered authorities  and  as a result  marginalized citizens. The authorities did not have the reason to make economic growth happen so that they could tax people and make more money for to run their business. Because they were getting it from abroad. And in fact  if you see oil rich countries  where citizens are not yet empowered  the same thing goes    Nigeria  Saudi Arabia  all sorts of countries. Because the aid and oil or mineral money acts the same way. It empowers authorities  without activating the citizens    their hands  legs  brains  what have you. And if you agree with that  then I think the best way to improve these countries is to recognize that economic development is of the people  by the people  for the people. And that is the real network effect. If citizens can network and make themselves more organized and productive  so that their voices are heard  so then things would improve. And to contrast that  you can see the most important institution in the world  the World Bank  is an organization of the government  by the government  for the governments. Just see the contrast. And that is the perspective I have  and then I can start my story. Of course  how would you empower citizens  There could be all sorts of technologies. And one is cell phones. Recently  The Economist  recognized this  but I stumbled upon the idea    years ago  and that's what I've been working on. So    years ago  I was trying to be an investment banker in New York. We had    quite a few our colleagues were connected by a computer network. And we got more productive because we didn't have to exchange floppy disks  we could update each other more often. But one time it broke down. And it reminded me of a day in     . There was a war going on in my country. And my family moved out of an urban place  where we used to live  to a remote rural area where it was safer. And one time my mother asked me to get some medicine for a younger sibling. And I walked    miles or so  all morning  to get there  to the medicine man. And he wasn't there  so I walked all afternoon back. So I had another unproductive day. So while I was sitting in a tall building in New York  I put those two experiences together side by side  and basically concluded that connectivity is productivity    whether it's in a modern office or an underdeveloped village. So naturally  I    the implication of that is that the telephone is a weapon against poverty. And if that's the case  then the question is how many telephones did we have at that time  And it turns out  that there was one telephone in Bangladesh for every     people. And all those phones were in the few urban places. The vast rural areas  where     million people lived  there were no telephones. So just imagine how many man months or man years are wasted  just like I wasted a day. If you just multiply by     million people  let's say losing one day a month  whatever  and you see a vast amount of resource wasted. And after all  poor countries  like rich countries  one thing we've got equal  is their days are the same length     hours. So if you lose that precious resource  where you are somewhat equal to the richer countries  that's a huge waste. So I started looking for any evidence that    does connectivity really increase productivity  And I couldn't find much  really  but I found this graph produced by the ITU  which is the International Telecommunication Union  based in Geneva. They show an interesting thing. That you see  the horizontal axis is where you place your country. So the United States or the UK would be here  outside. And so the impact of one new telephone  which is on the vertical axis  is very little. But if you come back to a poorer country  where the GNP per capita is  let's say      dollars  or     dollars  then the impact is huge        dollars. Or       dollars. The question was  how much did it cost to install a new telephone in Bangladesh  It turns out        dollars. So if you spend       dollars  and let's say the telephone lasts    years  and if       dollars every year    so that's        dollars. So obviously this was a gadget to have. And of course  if the cost of installing a telephone is going down  because there's a digital revolution going on  then it would be even more dramatic. And I knew a little economics by then    it says Adam Smith taught us that specialization leads to productivity. But how would you specialize  Let's say I'm a fisherman and a farmer. And Chris is a fisherman farmer. Both are generalists. So the point is that we could only    the only way we could depend on each other  is if we can connect with each other. And if we are neighbors  I could just walk over to his house. But then we are limiting our economic sphere to something very small area. But in order to expand that  you need a river  or you need a highway  or you need telephone lines. But in any event  it's connectivity that leads to dependability. And that leads to specialization. That leads to productivity. So the question was  I started looking at this issue  and going back and forth between Bangladesh and New York. There were a lot of reasons people told me why we don't have enough telephones. And one of them is the lacking buying power. Poor people apparently don't have the power to buy. But the point is  if it's a production tool  why do we have to worry about that  I mean  in America  people buy cars  and they put very little money down. They get a car  and they go to work. The work pays them a salary  the salary allows them to pay for the car over time. The car pays for itself. So if the telephone is a production tool  then we don't quite have to worry about the purchasing power. And of course  even if that's true  then what about initial buying power  So then the question is  why can't we have some kind of shared access  In the United States  we have    everybody needs a banking service  but very few of us are trying to buy a bank. So it's    a bank tends to serve a whole community. So we could do that for telephones. And also people told me that we have a lot of important primary needs to meet  food  clothing  shelter  whatever. But again  it's very paternalistic. You should be raising income and let people decide what they want to do with their money. But the real problem is the lack of other infrastructures. See  you need some kind of infrastructure to bring a new thing. For instance  the Internet was booming in the U.S. because there were    there were people who had computers. They had modems. They had telephone lines  so it's very easy to bring in a new idea  like the Internet. But that's what's lacking in a poor country. So for example  we didn't have ways to have credit checks  few banks to collect bills  etc. But that's why I noticed Grameen Bank  which is a bank for poor people  and had       branches         employees   .  million borrowers. And they had these branches. I thought I could put cell towers and create a network. And anyway  to cut the time short    so I started    I first went to them and said   You know  perhaps I could connect all your branches and make you more efficient.  But you know  they have  after all  evolved in a country without telephones  so they are decentralized. I mean  of course there might be other good reasons  but this was one of the reasons    they had to be. And so they were not that interested to connect all their branches  and then to be    and rock the boat. So I started focusing. What is it that they really do  So what happens is that somebody borrows money from the bank. She typically buys a cow. The cow gives milk. And she sells the milk to the villagers  and pays off the loan. And this is a business for her  but it's milk for everybody else. And suddenly I realized that a cell phone could be a cow. Because some way she could borrow     dollars from the bank  get a phone and have the phone for everybody. And it's a business for her. So I wrote to the bank  and they thought for a while  and they said   It's a little crazy  but logical. If you think it can be done  come and make it happen.  So I quit my job  I went back to Bangladesh. I created a company in America called Gonofone  which in Bengali means  people's phone.  And angel investors in America put in money into that. I flew around the world. After about a million    I mean  I got rejected from lots of places  because I was not only trying to go to a poor country  I was trying to go to the poor of the poor country. After about a million miles  and a meaningful    a substantial loss of hair  I eventually put together a consortium  and    which involved the Norwegian telephone company  which provided the know how  and the Grameen Bank provided the infrastructure to spread the service. To make the story short  here is the coverage of the country. You can see it's pretty much covered. Even in Bangladesh  there are some empty places. But we are also investing around another     million dollars this year to extend that coverage. Now  about that cow model I talked about. There are about         people who are retailing telephone services in their neighborhoods. And it's serving        villages  which represent about    million people. And these phones are generating about     million dollars for the company. And two dollars profit per entrepreneur per day  which is like     dollars per year. And of course  it's very beneficial in a lot of ways. It increases income  improves welfare  etc. And the result is  right now  this company is the largest telephone company  with  .  million subscribers          of these phones I talked about    that produces about a third of the traffic in the network. And       the net profit  after taxes    very serious taxes    was     million dollars. And the company contributed about     million dollars to the government coffers. And again  here are some of the lessons.  The government needs to provide economically viable services.  Actually  this is an instance where private companies can provide that.  Governments need to subsidize private companies.  This is what some people think. And actually  private companies help governments with taxes.  Poor people are recipients.  Poor people are a resource.  Services cost too much for the poor.  Their involvement reduces the cost.  The poor are uneducated and cannot do much.  They are very eager learners and very capable survivors. I've been very surprised. Most of them learn how to operate a telephone within a day.  Poor countries need aid.  Businesses    this one company has raised the    if the ideal figures are even five percent true  this one company is raising the GNP of the country much more than the aid the country receives. And as I was trying to show you  as far as I'm concerned  aid does damages because it removes the government from its citizens. And this is a new project I have with Dean Kamen  the famous inventor in America. He has produced some power generators  which we are now doing an experiment in Bangladesh  in two villages where cow manure is producing biogas  which is running these generators. And each of these generators is selling electricity to    houses each. It's just an experiment. We don't know how far it will go  but it's going on. Thank you. I want to start with a story  a la Seth Godin  from when I was    years old. My uncle Ed gave me a beautiful blue sweater    at least I thought it was beautiful. And it had fuzzy zebras walking across the stomach  and Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Meru were kind of right across the chest  that were also fuzzy. And I wore it whenever I could  thinking it was the most fabulous thing I owned. Until one day in ninth grade  when I was standing with a number of the football players. And my body had clearly changed  and Matt  who was undeniably my nemesis in high school  said in a booming voice that we no longer had to go far away to go on ski trips  but we could all ski on Mount Novogratz. And I was so humiliated and mortified that I immediately ran home to my mother and chastised her for ever letting me wear the hideous sweater. We drove to the Goodwill and we threw the sweater away somewhat ceremoniously  my idea being that I would never have to think about the sweater nor see it ever again. Fast forward       years later  I'm a    year old kid. I'm working in Kigali  Rwanda  jogging through the steep slopes  when I see     feet in front of me  a little boy       years old    running toward me  wearing my sweater. And I'm thinking  no  this is not possible. But so  curious  I run up to the child    of course scaring the living bejesus out of him    grab him by the collar  turn it over  and there is my name written on the collar of this sweater. I tell that story  because it has served and continues to serve as a metaphor to me about the level of connectedness that we all have on this Earth. We so often don't realize what our action and our inaction does to people we think we will never see and never know. I also tell it because it tells a larger contextual story of what aid is and can be. That this traveled into the Goodwill in Virginia  and moved its way into the larger industry  which at that point was giving millions of tons of secondhand clothing to Africa and Asia. Which was a very good thing  providing low cost clothing. And at the same time  certainly in Rwanda  it destroyed the local retailing industry. Not to say that it shouldn't have  but that we have to get better at answering the questions that need to be considered when we think about consequences and responses. So  I'm going to stick in Rwanda  circa             where I was doing two things. I had started a bakery with    unwed mothers. We were called the  Bad News Bears   and our notion was we were going to corner the snack food business in Kigali  which was not hard because there were no snacks before us. And because we had a good business model  we actually did it  and I watched these women transform on a micro level. But at the same time  I started a micro finance bank  and tomorrow Iqbal Quadir is going to talk about Grameen  which is the grandfather of all micro finance banks  which now is a worldwide movement    you talk about a meme    but then it was quite new  especially in an economy that was moving from barter into trade. We got a lot of things right. We focused on a business model  we insisted on skin in the game. The women made their own decisions at the end of the day as to how they would use this access to credit to build their little businesses  earn more income so they could take care of their families better. What we didn't understand  what was happening all around us  with the confluence of fear  ethnic strife and certainly an aid game  if you will  that was playing into this invisible but certainly palpable movement inside Rwanda  that at that time     percent of the budget was all foreign aid. The genocide happened in       seven years after these women all worked together to build this dream. And the good news was that the institution  the banking institution  lasted. In fact  it became the largest rehabilitation lender in the country. The bakery was completely wiped out  but the lessons for me were that accountability counts    got to build things with people on the ground  using business models where  as Steven Levitt would say  the incentives matter. Understand  however complex we may be  incentives matter. So when Chris raised to me how wonderful everything that was happening in the world  that we were seeing a shift in zeitgeist  on the one hand I absolutely agree with him  and I was so thrilled to see what happened with the G     that the world  because of people like Tony Blair and Bono and Bob Geldof    the world is talking about global poverty  the world is talking about Africa in ways I have never seen in my life. It's thrilling. And at the same time  what keeps me up at night is a fear that we'll look at the victories of the G        billion dollars in increased aid to Africa     billion in reduced debt    as the victory  as more than chapter one  as our moral absolution. And in fact  what we need to do is see that as chapter one  celebrate it  close it  and recognize that we need a chapter two that is all about execution  all about the how to. And if you remember one thing from what I want to talk about today  it's that the only way to end poverty  to make it history  is to build viable systems on the ground that deliver critical and affordable goods and services to the poor  in ways that are financially sustainable and scaleable. If we do that  we really can make poverty history. And it was that    that whole philosophy    that encouraged me to start my current endeavor called  Acumen Fund   which is trying to build some mini blueprints for how we might do that in water  health and housing in Pakistan  India  Kenya  Tanzania and Egypt. And I want to talk a little bit about that  and some of the examples  so you can see what it is that we're doing. But before I do this    and this is another one of my pet peeves    I want to talk a little bit about who the poor are. Because we too often talk about them as these strong  huge masses of people yearning to be free  when in fact  it's quite an amazing story. On a macro level  four billion people on Earth make less than four dollars a day. That's who we talk about when we think about  the poor.  If you aggregate it  it's the third largest economy on Earth  and yet most of these people go invisible. Where we typically work  there's people making between one and three dollars a day. Who are these people  They are farmers and factory workers. They work in government offices. They're drivers. They are domestics. They typically pay for critical goods and services like water  like healthcare  like housing  and they pay    to    times what their middleclass counterparts pay    certainly where we work in Karachi and Nairobi. The poor also are willing to make  and do make  smart decisions  if you give them that opportunity. So  two examples. One is in India  where there are     million farmers  most of whom make less than two dollars a day. Where we work in Aurangabad  the land is extraordinarily parched. You see people on average making    cents to a dollar. This guy in pink is a social entrepreneur named Ami Tabar. What he did was see what was happening in Israel  larger approaches  and figure out how to do a drip irrigation  which is a way of bringing water directly to the plant stock. But previously it's only been created for large scale farms  so Ami Tabar took this and modularized it down to an eighth of an acre. A couple of principles  build small. Make it infinitely expandable and affordable to the poor. This family  Sarita and her husband  bought a    dollar unit when they were living in a    literally a three walled lean to with a corrugated iron roof. After one harvest  they had increased their income enough to buy a second system to do their full quarter acre. A couple of years later  I meet them. They now make four dollars a day  which is pretty much middle class for India  and they showed me the concrete foundation they had just laid to build their house. And I swear  you could see the future in that woman's eyes. Something I truly believe. You can't talk about poverty today without talking about malaria bed nets  and I again give Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard huge kudos for bringing to the world this notion of his rage    for five dollars you can save a life. Malaria is a disease that kills one to three million people a year.     to     million cases are reported. It's estimated that Africa loses about    billion dollars a year to the disease. Five dollars can save a life. We can send people to the moon  we can see if there's life on Mars    why can't we get five dollar nets to     million people  The question  though  is not  Why can't we   The question is how can we help Africans do this for themselves  A lot of hurdles. One  production is too low. Two  price is too high. Three  this is a good road in    right near where our factory is located. Distribution is a nightmare  but not impossible. We started by making a         dollar loan to the largest traditional bed net manufacturer in Africa so that they could transfer technology from Japan and build these long lasting  five year nets. Here are just some pictures of the factory. Today  three years later  the company has employed another thousand women. It contributes about         dollars in wages to the economy of Tanzania. It's the largest company in Tanzania. The throughput rate right now is  .  million nets  three million by the end of the year. We hope to have seven million at the end of next year. So the production side is working. On the distribution side  though  as a world  we have a lot of work to do. Right now     percent of these nets are being bought by the U.N.  and then given primarily to people around Africa. We're looking at building on some of the most precious resources of Africa  people. Their women. And so I want you to meet Jacqueline  my namesake     years old. If she were born anywhere else but Tanzania  I'm telling you  she could run Wall Street. She runs two of the lines  and has already saved enough money to put a down payment on her house. She makes about two dollars a day  is creating an education fund  and told me she is not marrying nor having children until these things are completed. And so  when I told her about our idea    that maybe we could take a Tupperware model from the United States  and find a way for the women themselves to go out and sell these nets to others    she quickly started calculating what she herself could make and signed up. We took a lesson from IDEO  one of our favorite companies  and quickly did a prototyping on this  and took Jacqueline into the area where she lives. She brought    of the women with whom she interacts together to see if she could sell these nets  five dollars apiece  despite the fact that people say nobody will buy one  and we learned a lot about how you sell things. Not coming in with our own notions  because she didn't even talk about malaria until the very end. First  she talked about comfort  status  beauty. These nets  she said  you put them on the floor  bugs leave your house. Children can sleep through the night  the house looks beautiful  you hang them in the window. And we've started making curtains  and not only is it beautiful  but people can see status    that you care about your children. Only then did she talk about saving your children's lives. A lot of lessons to be learned in terms of how we sell goods and services to the poor. I want to end just by saying that there's enormous opportunity to make poverty history. To do it right  we have to build business models that matter  that are scaleable and that work with Africans  Indians  people all over the developing world who fit in this category  to do it themselves. Because at the end of the day  it's about engagement. It's about understanding that people really don't want handouts  that they want to make their own decisions  they want to solve their own problems  and that by engaging with them  not only do we create much more dignity for them  but for us as well. And so I urge all of you to think next time as to how to engage with this notion and this opportunity that we all have    to make poverty history    by really becoming part of the process and moving away from an us and them world  and realizing that it's about all of us  and the kind of world that we  together  want to live in and share. Thank you. A public  Dewey long ago observed  is constituted through discussion and debate. If we are to call the tyranny of assumptions into question  and avoid doxa  the realm of the unquestioned  then we must be willing to subject our own assumptions to debate and discussion. It is in this spirit that I join into a discussion of one of the critical issues of our time  namely  how to mobilize different forms of capital for the project of state building. To put the assumptions very clearly  capitalism  after     years  has become acceptable  and so has democracy. If we looked in the world of      and looked at the map of capitalist economies and democratic polities  they were the rare exception  not the norm. The question now  however  is both about which form of capitalism and which type of democratic participation. But we must acknowledge that this moment has brought about a rare consensus of assumptions. And that provides the ground for a type of action  because consensus of each moment allows us to act. And it is necessary  no matter how fragile or how provisional our consensus  to be able to move forward. But the majority of the world neither benefits from capitalism nor from democratic systems. Most of the globe experiences the state as repressive  as an organization that is concerned about denial of rights  about denial of justice  rather than provision of it. And in terms of experience of capitalism  there are two aspects that the rest of the globe experiences. First  extractive industry. Blood diamonds  smuggled emeralds  timber  that is cut right from under the poorest. Second is technical assistance. And technical assistance might shock you  but it's the worst form of    today    of the ugly face of the developed world to the developing countries. Tens of billions of dollars are supposedly spent on building capacity with people who are paid up to       dollars a day  who are incapable of thinking creatively  or organically. Next assumption    and of course the events of July    I express my deep sympathy  and before that  September       have reminded us we do not live in three different worlds. We live in one world. But that's easily said. But we are not dealing with the implications of the one world that we are living in. And that is that if we want to have one world  this one world cannot be based on huge pockets of exclusion  and then inclusion for some. We must now finally come to think about the premises of a truly global world  in relationship to the regime of rights and responsibilities and accountabilities that are truly global in scope. Otherwise we will be missing this open moment in history  where we have a consensus on both the form of politics and the form of economics. What is one of these organizations to pick  We have three critical terms  economy  civil society and the state. I will not deal with those first two  except to say that uncritical transfer of assumptions  from one context to another  can only make for disaster. Economics taught in most of the elite universities are practically useless in my context. My country is dominated by drug economy and a mafia. Textbook economics does not work in my context  and I have very few recommendations from anybody as to how to put together a legal economy. The poverty of our knowledge must become the first basis of moving forward  and not imposition of the framework that works on the basis of mathematical modeling  for which I have enormous respect. My colleagues at Johns Hopkins were among the best. Second  instead of debating endlessly about what is the structure of the state  why don't we simplify and say  what are a series of functions that the state in the   st century must perform  Clare Lockhart and I are writing a book on this  we hope to share that much widely with    and third is that we could actually construct an index to measure comparatively how well these functions that we would agree on are being performed in different places. So what are these functions  We propose   . And it's legitimate monopoly of means of violence  administrative control  management of public finances  investment in human capital  provision of citizenship rights  provision of infrastructure  management of the tangible and intangible assets of the state through regulation  creation of the market  international agreements  including public borrowing  and then  most importantly  rule of law. I won't elaborate. I hope the questions will give me an opportunity. This is a feasible goal  basically because  contrary to widespread assumption  I would argue that we know how to do this. Who would have imagined that Germany would be either united or democratic today  if you looked at it from the perspective of Oxford of       But people at Oxford prepared for a democratic Germany and engaged in planning. And there are lots of other examples. Now in order to do this    and this brings this group    we have to rethink the notion of capital. The least important form of capital  in this project  is financial capital    money. Money is not capital in most of the developing countries. It's just cash. Because it lacks the institutional  organizational  managerial forms to turn it into capital. And what is required is a combination of physical capital  institutional capital  human capital    and security  of course  is critical  but so is information. Now  the issue that should concern us here    and that's the challenge that I would like to pose to this group    is again  it takes    years in your countries to produce somebody with a B.S. degree. It takes    years to produce somebody with a Ph.D. The first challenge is to rethink  fundamentally  the issue of the time. Do we need to repeat the modalities that we have inherited  Our educational systems are inherited from the   th century. What is it that we need to do fundamentally to re engage in a project  that capital formation is rapid  The absolute majority of the world's population are below     and they are growing larger and faster. They need different ways of being approached  different ways of being enfranchised  different ways of being skilled. And that's the first thing. Second is  you're problem solvers  but you're not engaging your global responsibility. You've stayed away from the problems of corruption. You only want clean environments in which to function. But if you don't think through the problems of corruption  who will  You stay away from design for development. You're great designers  but your designs are selfish. It's for your own immediate use. The world in which I operate operates with designs regarding roads  or dams  or provision of electricity that have not been revisited in    years. This is not right. It requires thinking. But  particularly  what we need more than anything else from this group is your imagination to be brought to bear on problems the way a meme is supposed to work. As the work on paradigms  long time ago showed    Thomas Kuhn's work    it's in the intersection of ideas that new developments    true breakthroughs    occur. And I hope that this group would be able to deal with the issue of state and development and the empowerment of the majority of the world's poor  through this means. Thank you. Chris Anderson  So  Ashraf  until recently  you were the finance minister of Afghanistan  a country right at the middle of much of the world's agenda. Is the country gonna make it  Will democracy flourish  What scares you most  Ashraf Ghani  What scares me most is    is you  lack of your engagement. You asked me. You know I always give the unconventional answer. No. But seriously  the issue of Afghanistan first has to be seen as  at least  a     to    year perspective. Today the world of globalization is on speed. Time has been compressed. And space does not exist for most people. But in my world    you know  when I went back to Afghanistan after    years  space had expanded. Every conceivable form of infrastructure had broken down. I rode    traveled    travel between two cities that used to take three hours now took   . So the first is when the scale is that  we need to recognize that just the simple things that are infrastructure    it takes six years to deliver infrastructure. In our world. Any meaningful sort of thing. But the modality of attention  or what is happening today  what's happening tomorrow. Second is  when a country has been subjected to one of the most immense  brutal forms of exercise of power    we had the Red Army for    continuous years          strong  literally terrorizing. The sky  every Afghan sees the sky as a source of fear. We were bombed practically out of existence. Then  tens of thousands of people were trained in terrorism    from all sides. The United States  Great Britain  joined for instance  Egyptian intelligence service to train thousands of people in resistance and urban terrorism. How to turn a bicycle into an instrument of terror. How to turn a donkey  a carthorse  anything. And the Russians  equally. So  when violence erupts in a country like Afghanistan  it's because of that legacy. But we have to understand that we've been incredibly lucky. I mean  I really can't believe how lucky I am here  standing in front of you  speaking. When I joined as finance minister  I thought that the chances of my living more than three years would not be more than five percent. Those were the risks. They were worth it. I think we can make it  and the reason we can make it is because of the people. You see  because  I mean    I give you one statistic.    percent of the men in Afghanistan     percent of the women  listen to at least three radio stations a day. In terms of their discourse  in terms of their sophistication of knowledge of the world  I think that I would dare say  they're much more sophisticated than rural Americans with college degrees and the bulk of Europeans    because the world matters to them. And what is their predominant concern  Abandonment. Afghans have become deeply internationalist. You know  when I went back in December of       I had absolutely no desire to work with the Afghan government because I'd lived as a nationalist. And I told them    my people  with the Americans here    separate. Yes  I have an advisory position with the U.N. I went through    Afghan provinces very rapidly. And everybody was telling me it was a different world. You know  they engage. They see engagement  global engagement  as absolutely necessary to the future of the ordinary people. And the thing that the ordinary Afghan is most concerned with is    Clare Lockhart is here  so I'll recite a discussion she had with an illiterate woman in Northern Afghanistan. And that woman said she didn't care whether she had food on her table. What she worried about was whether there was a plan for the future  where her children could really have a different life. That gives me hope. CA  How is Afghanistan going to provide alternative income to the many people who are making their living off the drugs trade  AG  Certainly. Well  the first is  instead of sending a billion dollars on drug eradication and paying it to a couple of security companies  they should give this hundred billion dollars to    of the most critically innovative companies in the world to ask them to create one million jobs. The key to the drug eradication is jobs. Look  there's a very little known fact  countries that have a legal average income per capita of       dollars don't produce drugs. Second  textile. Trade is the key  not aid. The U.S. and Europe should give us a zero percent tariff. The textile industry is incredibly mobile. If you want us to be able to compete with China and to attract investment  we could probably attract four to six billion dollars quite easily in the textile sector  if there was zero tariffs    would create the type of job. Cotton does not compete with opium  a t shirt does. And we need to understand  it's the value chain. Look  the ordinary Afghan is sick and tired of hearing about microcredit. It is important  but what the ordinary women and men who engage in micro production want is global access. They don't want to sell to the charity bazaars that are only for foreigners    and the same bloody shirt embroidered time and again. What we want is a partnership with the Italian design firms. Yeah  we have the best embroiderers in the world  Why can't we do what was done with northern Italy  With the Put Out system  So I think economically  the critical issue really is to now think through. And what I will say here is that aid doesn't work. You know  the aid system is broken. The aid system does not have the knowledge  the vision  the ability. I'm all for it  after all  I raised a lot of it. Yeah  to be exact  you know  I managed to persuade the world that they had to give my country   .  billion. They didn't want to give us the money. CA  And it still didn't work  AG  No. It's not that it didn't work. It's that a dollar of private investment  in my judgment  is equal at least to    dollars of aid  in terms of the dynamic that it generates. Second is that one dollar of aid could be    cents  it could be    cents  or it could be four dollars. It depends on what form it comes  what degrees of conditionalities are attached to it. You know  the aid system  at first  was designed to benefit entrepreneurs of the developed countries  not to generate growth in the poor countries. And this is  again  one of those assumptions    the way car seats are an assumption that we've inherited in governments  and doors. You would think that the US government would not think that American firms needed subsidizing to function in developing countries  provide advice  but they do. There's an entire weight of history vis a vis aid that now needs to be reexamined. If the goal is to build states that can credibly take care of themselves    and I'm putting that proposition equally  you know I'm very harsh on my counterparts    aid must end in each country in a definable period. And every year there must be progress on mobilization of domestic revenue and generation of the economy. Unless that kind of compact is entered into  you will not be able to sustain the consensus. Video  Narrator  An event seen from one point of view gives one impression. Seen from another point of view  it gives quite a different impression. But it's only when you get the whole picture you can fully understand what's going on. Sasha Vucinic  It's a great clip  isn't it  And I found that in    seconds  it tells more about the power of  and importance of  independent media than I could say in an hour. So I thought that it will be good to start with it. And also start with a little bit of statistics. According to relevant researchers     percent of the population of this planet lives in the societies without independent press. Think about that number     percent of the population on the whole planet does not really know what is going on in their countries. The information they get gets filtered through somebody who either twists that information  or colors that information  does something with it. So they're deprived of understanding their reality. That is just to understand how big and important this problem is. Now those of you who are lucky enough to live in those societies that represent    percent  I think should enjoy it until it lasts. You know  Sunday morning  you flick the paper  get your cappuccino. Enjoy it while it lasts. Because as we heard yesterday  countries can lose stars from their flags  but they can also lose press freedom  as I guess Americans among us can tell us more about. But that's totally another and separate topic. So I can go back to my story. My story starts    the story I want to share    starts in     . At that time I was running B    the only independent  for that matter the only electronic media  in the country. And I guess we were sharing    we had that regular life of the only independent media in the country  operating in hostile environment  where government really wants to make your life miserable. And there are different ways. Yeah  it was the usual cocktail  a little bit of threats  a little bit of friendly advice  a little bit of financial police  a little bit of text control  so you always have somebody who never leaves your office. But what they really do  which is very powerful  and that is what governments in the late '  s started doing if they don't like independent media companies    you know  they threaten your advertisers. Once they threaten your advertisers  market forces are actually  you know  destroyed  and the advertisers do not want to come    no matter how much does it make sense for them    do not want to come and advertise. And you have a problem making ends meet. At that time at the beginning of the '  s  we had that problem  which was  you know  survival below one side  but what was really painful for me was  remember  the beginning of the '  s  Yugoslavia is falling apart. We were sitting over there with a country in a downfall  in a slow motion downfall. And we all had all of that on tapes. We had the ability to understand what was going on. We were actually recording history. The problem was that we had to re tape that history a week later  because if we did not  we could not afford enough tapes to keep archives of that history. So if I gave you that picture  I don't want to go too long on that. In that context a gentleman came to my office at that time. It was still     . He was running a media systems organization which is still in business  the gentleman is still in business. And what did I know at that time about media systems  I would think media systems were organizations  which means they should help you. So I prepared two plans for that meeting  two strategic plans  the small one and the big one. The small one was  I just wanted him to help us get those damn tapes  so we can keep that archive for the next    years. The big plan was to ask him for a           dollar loan. Because I thought  I still maintain  that serious and independent media companies are great business. And I thought that B   will survive and be a great company once Milosevic is gone  which turned out to be true. It's now probably either the biggest or the second biggest media company in the country. And I thought that the only thing that we needed at that time was           dollar loan to take us through those hard times. To make a long story short  the gentleman comes into the office  great suit and tie. I gave him what I thought was a brilliant explanation of the political situation and explained how hard and difficult the war will be. Actually  I underestimated the atrocities  I have to admit. Anyway  after that whole  big  long explanation  the only question he had for me    and this is not a joke    is  are we paying royalties after we broadcast music of Michael Jackson  That was really the only question he had. He left  and I remember being actually very angry at myself because I thought there must be an institution in the world that is providing loans to media companies. It's so obvious  straight in your face  and somebody must have thought of it. Somebody must have started something like that. And I thought  I'm just dumb and I cannot find it. You know  in my defense  there was no Google at that time  you could not just Google in '  . So I thought that that's actually my problem. Now we go from here  fast forward to     . I have    I left the country  I have a meeting with George Soros  trying for the third time to convince him that his foundation should invest in something that should operate like a media bank. And basically what I was saying is very simple. You know  forget about charity  it doesn't work. Forget about handouts         dollars do not help anybody. What you should do is you should treat media companies as a business. It's business anywhere. Media business  or any other business  it needs to be capitalized. And what these guys need  actually  is access to capital. So third meeting  arguments are pretty well exercised. At the end of the meeting he says  look  it is not going to work  you will never see your money back  but my foundations will put         dollars so you can test the idea. See that it will not work. He said  I'll give you a rope to hang yourself. I knew two things after that meeting. First  under no circumstances I want to hang myself. And second  that I have no idea how to make it work. You see  at the level of a concept  it was a great concept. But it's one thing to have a concept  it's a totally separate thing to actually make it work. So I had absolutely no idea how that could actually work. Had the wrong idea  I thought that we can be a bank. You see banks    I don't know if there are any bankers over here  I apologize in advance    but it's the best job in the world. You know  you find somebody who is respectable and has a lot of money. You give them more money  they repay you that over a time. You collect interest and do nothing in between. So I thought  why don't we get into that business  So here we are having our first client  brilliant. First independent newspaper in Slovakia. The government cutting them off from all the printing facilities in Bratislava. So here's the daily newspaper that has to be printed     kilometers away from the capital. It's a daily newspaper with a deadline of   p.m. That means that they have no sports  they have no latest news  circulation goes down. It's a kind of very nice  sophisticated way how to economically strangle a daily newspaper. They come to us with a request for a loan. They want to    the only way for them to survive is to get a printing press. And we said  that's fine  let's meet  you'll bring us your business plan  which eventually they did. We start the meeting. I get these two pieces of paper  not like this  A  format  so it's much bigger. A lot of numbers there. A lot of numbers. But however you put it  you know  the numbers do not make any sense. And that's the best they could do. We were the best that they could do. So that is how we understood what our method is. It's not a bank. We had to actually go into these companies and earn our return by fixing them    by establishing management systems  by providing all that knowledge  how do you run a business on one side    while they all know how to run  how to create content. Just quickly on the results. Over these    years     million dollars in affordable financing  average interest rate five percent to six percent. Lately we are going wild  charging seven percent from time to time. We do it in    countries of the developing world. And here is the most stunning number. Return rate    the one that Soros was so worried about       percent.    percent of all the scheduled repayments came back to us on time. What do we typically finance  We finance anything that a media company would need  from printing presses to transmitters. What is most important is we do it either in form of loans  equities  lease    whatever is appropriate for  you know  supporting anybody. But what is most important here is  who do we finance  We believe that in the last    years companies that we've financed are actually the best media companies in the developing world. That is a  Who is Who  list. And I could spend hours talking about them  because they're all kind of heroes. And I can  but I'll give you just  maybe one  and depending on time I may give you two examples who we work with. You see we started working in Eastern and Central Europe  and moved to Russia. Our first loan in Russia was in Chelyabinsk. I'll bet half of you have never heard of that place. In the south of Russia there's a guy called Boris Nikolayevich Kirshin  who is running an independent newspaper there. The city was closed until early '  s because  of all things  they were producing glass for Tupolev planes. Anyway  he's running independent newspaper there. After two years working with us  he becomes the most respected newspaper in that small place. Governor comes to him one day  actually invites him to come to his office. He goes and sees the governor. The governor says  Boris Nikolayevich  I understand you are doing a great job  and you are the most respected newspaper in our district. And I want to offer you a deal. Can you please give me your newspaper for the next nine months  because I have elections    there are elections coming up in nine months. I will not run  but it's very important for me who is going to succeed me. So give me the paper for nine months. I'll give it back to you. I have no interest in being in media business. How much would that cost  Boris Nikolayevich says   It's not for sale.  The governor says   We will close you.  Boris Nikolayevich says   No  you cannot do it.  Six months later the newspaper was closed. Luckily  we had enough time to help Boris Nikolayevich take all the assets out of that company and bring him into a new one  to get all the subscription lists  rehire staff. So what the governor got was an empty shell. But that is what happens if you're in business of independent media  and if you are a banker for independent media. So it sounds like a great story. Somewhere down the road we opened a media management center. We started our media lab  sounds like a real great story. But there is a second angle to that. The second angle  like in this clip. If you take the camera above  you start thinking about these numbers again.    million dollars over    years spread over    countries. That is not too much  is it  It's actually just a drop in the sea. Because when you think about the importance  some of the issues that we were talking about last night    this last session we had about Africa and his hypothetical    billion dollars destined for Africa. All of those  not all  half of those problems mentioned last night    government accountability  corruption  how do you fight corruption  giving voice to unheard  to poor    it's why independent media is in business. And it's why it was invented. So from that perspective  what we did is just really one drop in the sea of that need that we can identify. Now ours is just one story. I'm sure that in this room there are  like     other wonderful stories of nonprofits doing spectacular work. Here is where the problem is  and I'll explain to you as well as I can what the problem is. And it's called fundraising. Imagine that this third of this room is filled with people who represent different foundations. Imagine two thirds over here running excellent organizations  doing very important work. Now imagine that every second person over here is deaf  does not hear  and switch the lights off. Now that is how difficult it is to match people from this side of the room with people of that side of the room. So we thought that some kind of a big idea is needed to reform  to totally rethink fundraising. You know  instead of people running in this dark  trying to find their own match  who will be willing  who has the same goals. Instead of all of that we thought there is    something new needs to be invented. And we came up with this idea of issuing bonds  press freedom bonds. If there are investors willing to finance U.S. government budget deficit  why wouldn't we find investors willing to finance press freedom deficit  We've decided to do it this fall  we will issue them  probably in denominations of       dollars. I don't want to advertise them too much  that's not the point. But the point is  if we ever survive to actually issue them  find enough investors that this can be considered a success  there's nothing stopping the next organization to start to issue bonds next spring. And those can be environmental bonds. And then two weeks later  Iqbal Quadir can issue his electricity in Bangladesh bonds. And before you know it  any social cause can be actually financed in this way. Now we do daydreaming in       with    seconds left. But let's take the idea further. You do it  you start it in the States  because it's  you know  concepts are very  very close to American minds. But you can actually bring it to Europe  too. You can bring it to Asia. You can  once you have all of those different points  you can make it easy for investors. Put all of those bonds at one place and they sit down and click. Once you have more than    of them you have to develop some kind of a matrix. What do investors get  On one side financial  on the other side social. So that brings the idea of some kind of rating agency  Morningstar type. It says  you know  social impact over here is spectacular  five stars. Financial  they give you one percent  only one star. Now take it to the last step. Once you have all of that put together  there's not one reason why you couldn't actually have a marketplace for all of that  where you cannot dispose of all of those bonds in a pretty quick way. And in that way you organize the financing so there are no dark rooms  no blind people running around to find each other. Thank you. I want to start off by saying  Houston  we have a problem. We're entering a second generation of no progress in terms of human flight in space. In fact  we've regressed. We stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youth to go out and continue this very important thing that we as a species have always done. And that is  instinctively we've gone out and climbed over difficult places  went to more hostile places  and found out later  maybe to our surprise  that that's the reason we survived. And I feel very strongly that it's not good enough for us to have generations of kids that think that it's OK to look forward to a better version of a cell phone with a video in it. They need to look forward to exploration  they need to look forward to colonization  they need to look forward to breakthroughs. We need to inspire them  because they need to lead us and help us survive in the future. I'm particularly troubled that what NASA's doing right now with this new Bush doctrine to    for this next decade and a half    oh shoot  I screwed up. We have real specific instructions here not to talk about politics. What we're looking forward to is    what we're looking forward to is not only the inspiration of our children  but the current plan right now is not really even allowing the most creative people in this country    the Boeing's and Lockheed's space engineers    to go out and take risks and try new stuff. We're going to go back to the moon ...    years later  And we're going to do it very specifically planned to not learn anything new. I'm really troubled by that. But anyway that's    the basis of the thing that I want to share with you today  though  is that right back to where we inspire people who will be our great leaders later. That's the theme of my next    minutes here. And I think that the inspiration begins when you're very young  three year olds  up to         year olds. What they look at is the most important thing. Let's take a snapshot at aviation. And there was a wonderful little short four year time period when marvelous things happened. It started in       when the Wright brothers flew in Paris  and everybody said   Ooh  hey  I can do that.  There's only a few people that have flown in early     . In four years     countries had hundreds of airplanes  thousand of pilots. Airplanes were invented by natural selection. Now you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today  but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes. There were probably at least        different things tried  and when they crash and kill the pilot  don't try that again. The ones that flew and landed OK because there were no trained pilots who had good flying qualities by definition. So we  by making a whole bunch of attempts  thousands of attempts  in that four year time period  we invented the concepts of the airplanes that we fly today. And that's why they're so safe  as we gave it a lot of chance to find what's good. That has not happened at all in space flying. There's only been two concepts tried    two by the U.S. and one by the Russians. Well  who was inspired during that time period  Aviation Week asked me to make a list of who I thought were the movers and shakers of the first     years of aviation. And I wrote them down and I found out later that every one of them was a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation. Well  what happened when I was a little kid was    some pretty heavy stuff too. The jet age started  the missile age started. Von Braun was on there showing how to go to Mars    and this was before Sputnik. And this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting than it is now. We thought there'd be animals there  we knew there were plants there  the colors change  right  But  you know  NASA screwed that up because they've sent these robots and they've landed it only in the deserts. If you look at what happened    this little black line is as fast as man ever flew  and the red line is top of the line military fighters and the blue line is commercial air transport. You notice here's a big jump when I was a little kid    and I think that had something to do with giving me the courage to go out and try something that other people weren't having the courage to try. Well  what did I do when I was a kid  I didn't do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing and  well  we didn't have drugs in those days. But I did competition model airplanes. I spent about seven years during the Vietnam War flight testing airplanes for the Air Force. And then I went in and I had a lot of fun building airplanes that people could build in their garages. And some       of those are flying. Of course  one of them is around the world Voyager. I founded another company in '    which is my company now. And we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since     . And there's a lot of them that I actually can't show you on this chart. The most impressive airplane ever  I believe  was designed only a dozen years after the first operational jet. Stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly  taken out of service. We retreated in '   back to something that was developed in '  . What  The most impressive spaceship ever  I believe  was a Grumman Lunar Lander. It was a    you know  it landed on the moon  take off of the moon  didn't need any maintenance guys    that's kind of cool. We've lost that capability. We abandoned it in '  . This thing was designed three years after Gagarin first flew in space in     . Three years  and we can't do that now. Crazy. Talk very briefly about innovation cycles  things that grow  have a lot of activity  they die out when they're replaced by something else. These things tend to happen every    years.    years long  with an overlap. You can put that statement on all kinds of different technologies. The interesting thing    by the way  the speed here  excuse me  higher speed travel is the title of these innovation cycles. There is none here. These two new airplanes are the same speed as the DC  that was done in     . Here's the biggie  and that is  you don't have innovation cycles if the government develops and the government uses it. You know  a good example  of course  is the DARPA net. Computers were used for artillery first  then IRS. But when we got it  now you have all the level of activity  all the benefit from it. Private sector has to do it. Keep that in mind. I put down innovation    I've looked for innovation cycles in space  I found none. The very first year  starting when Gagarin went in space  and a few weeks later Alan Shepherd  there were five manned space flights in the world    the very first year. In       everyone that the United States sent to space was killed. There were only three or four flights in     . In       there were only two flights  two Russian Soyuz flights to the international manned station. And I had to fly three in Mojave with my little group of a couple dozen people in order to get to a total of five  which was the number the same year back in     . There is no growth. There's no activity. There's no nothing. This is a picture here taken from SpaceShipOne. This is a picture here taken from orbit. Our goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that. We know how to do it for sub orbital flying now  do it safe enough    at least as safe as the early airlines    so that can be done. And I think I want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage to go out and try that as a small company. Well  first of all  what's going to happen next  The first industry will be a high volume  a lot of players. There's another one announced just last week. And it will be sub orbital. And the reason it has to be sub orbital is  there is not solutions for adequate safety to fly the public to orbit. The governments have been doing this    three governments have been doing this for    years  and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died. That's    You don't want to run a business with that kind of a safety record. It'll be very high volume  we think         people will fly by     . I can't tell you when this will start  because I don't want my competition to know my schedule. But I think once it does  we will find solutions  and very quickly  you'll see those resort hotels in orbit. And that real easy thing to do  which is a swing around the moon so you have this cool view. And that will be really cool. Because the moon doesn't have an atmosphere    you can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by    feet if you want. Oh  it's going to be so much fun. OK. My critics say   Hey  Rutan's just spending a lot of these billionaires' money for joyrides for billionaires. What's this  This is not a transportation system  it's just for fun.  And I used to be bothered by that  and then I got to thinking  well  wait a minute. I bought my first Apple computer in      and I bought it because I could say   I got a computer at my house and you don't. 'What do you use it for ' Come over. It does Frogger.  OK. Not the bank's computer or Lockheed's computer  but the home computer was for games. For a whole decade it was for fun    we didn't even know what it was for. But what happened  the fact that we had this big industry  big development  big improvement and capability and so on  and they get out there in enough homes    we were ripe for a new invention. And the inventor is in this audience. Al Gore invented the Internet and because of that  something that we used for a whole year    excuse me    a whole decade for fun  became everything    our commerce  our research  our communication and  if we let the Google guys think for another couple weekends  we can add a dozen more things to the list.  Laughter  And it won't be very long before you won't be able to convince kids that we didn't always have computers in our homes. So fun is defendable. OK  I want to show you kind of a busy chart  but in it is my prediction with what's going to happen. And in it also brings up another point  right here. There's a group of people that have come forward    and you don't know all of them    but the ones that have come forward were inspired as young children  this little three  to    year old age  by us going to orbit and going to the moon here  right in this time period. Paul Allen  Elan Musk  Richard Branson  Jeff Bezos  the Ansari family  which is now funding the Russians' sub orbital thing  Bob Bigelow  a private space station  and Carmack. These people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area  and I think it's a lot better than they put it in an area of a better cell phone or something    but they're putting it in very    areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability  and it will lead us into the next really big thing and it will allow us to explore. And I think eventually it will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct. They were inspired by big progress. But look at the progress that's going on after that. There were a couple of examples here. The military fighters had a    highest performance military airplane was the SR  . It went a whole life cycle  got too rusty to fly  and was taken out of service. The Concorde doubled the speed for airline travel. It went a whole life cycle without competition  took out of service. And we're stuck back here with the same kind of capability for military fighters and commercial airline travel that we had back in the late '  s. But something is out there to inspire our kids now. And I'm talking about if you've got a baby now  or if you've got a    year old now. What's out there is there's something really interesting going to happen here. Relatively soon  you'll be able to buy a ticket and fly higher and faster than the highest performance military operational airplane. It's never happened before. The fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance has been  well  you know  you win the war in    minutes  why do you need something better  But I think when you guys start buying tickets and flying sub orbital flights to space  very soon    wait a minute  what's happening here  we'll have military fighters with sub orbital capability  and I think very soon this. But the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first. OK  I look forward to a new  capitalist's space race   let's call it. You remember the space race in the '  s was for national prestige  because we lost the first two milestones. We didn't lose them technically. The fact that we had the hardware to put something in orbit when we let Von Braun fly it    you can argue that's not a technical loss. Sputnik wasn't a technical loss  but it was a prestige loss. America    the world saw America as not being the leader in technology  and that was a very strong thing. And then we flew Alan Shepherd weeks after Gagarin  not months or decades  or whatever. So we had the capability. But America lost. We lost. And because of that  we made a big jump to recover it. Well  again  what's interesting here is we've lost to the Russians on the first couple of milestones already. You cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in America    can't do it. You can buy it in Russia. You can fly with Russian hardware. This is available because a Russian space program is starving  and it's nice for them to get    million here and there to take one of the seats. It's commercial. It can be defined as space tourism. They are also offering a trip to go on this whip around the moon  like Apollo   was done.     million bucks    hey  I can go to the moon. But  you know  would you have thought back in the '  s  when the space race was going on  that the first commercial capitalist like thing to do to buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in Russian hardware  And would you have thought  would the Russians have thought  that when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware  the guys inside won't be Russians  Maybe it'll probably be a Japanese or an American billionaire  Well  that's weird  you know  it really is. But anyway  I think we need to beat them again. I think what we'll do is we'll see a successful  very successful  private space flight industry. Whether we're first or not really doesn't matter. The Russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the Concorde. And then they flew a few cargo flights  and took it out of service. I think you kind of see the same kind of parallel when the commercial stuff is offered. OK  we'll talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight. This little thing says here  five times what NASA's doing by     . I want to tell you  already there's about  .  billion to  .  billion investment in private space flight that is not government at all    already  worldwide. If you read    if you Google it  you'll find about half of that money  but there's twice of that being committed out there    not spent yet  but being committed and planned for the next few years. Hey  that's pretty big. I'm predicting  though  as profitable as this industry is going to be    and it certainly is profitable when you fly people at         dollars on something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost  or less    this is going to be very profitable. I predict  also  that the investment that will flow into this will be somewhere around half of what the U.S. taxpayer spends for NASA's manned spacecraft work. And every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently by a factor of    to   . And what that means is before we know it  the progress in human space flight  with no taxpayer dollars  will be at a level of about five times as much as the current NASA budgets for human space flight. And that is because it's us. It's private industry. You should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff    and we've done it for a long time. The NACA  before NASA  never developed an airliner and never ran an airline. But NASA is developing the space liner  always has  and runs the only space line  OK. And we've shied away from it because we're afraid of it. But starting back in June of       when I showed that a little group out there actually can do it  can get a start with it  everything changed after that time. OK  thank you very much. This is me. My name is Ben Saunders. I specialize in dragging heavy things around cold places. On May   th last year  I stood alone at the North geographic Pole. I was the only human being in an area one and a half times the size of America  five and a half thousand square miles. More than       people have climbed Everest.    people have stood on the moon. Including me  only four people have skied solo to the North Pole. And I think the reason for that       thank you    I think the reason for that is that it's    it's    well  it's as Chris said  bonkers. It's a journey that is right at the limit of human capability. I skied the equivalent of    marathons back to back.     miles in    weeks. And I was dragging all the food I needed  the supplies  the equipment  sleeping bag  one change of underwear    everything I needed for nearly three months. What we're going to try and do today  in the    and a bit minutes I've got left  is to try and answer three questions. The first one is  why  The second one is  how do you go to the loo at minus      Ben  I've read somewhere that at minus     exposed skin becomes frostbitten in less than a minute  so how do you answer the call of nature   I don't want to answer these now. I'll come on to them at the end. Third one  how do you top that  What's next  It all started back in     . My first expedition was with a guy called Pen Hadow    enormously experienced chap. This was like my polar apprenticeship. We were trying to ski from this group of islands up here  Severnaya Zemlya  to the North Pole. And the thing that fascinates me about the North Pole  geographic North Pole  is that it's slap bang in the middle of the sea. This is about as good as maps get  and to reach it you've got to ski literally over the frozen crust  the floating skin of ice on the Artic Ocean. I'd spoken to all the experts. I'd read lots of books. I studied maps and charts. But I realized on the morning of day one that I had no idea exactly what I'd let myself in for. I was    years old. No one my age had attempted anything like this  and pretty quickly  almost everything that could have gone wrong did go wrong. We were attacked by a polar bear on day two. I had frostbite in my left big toe. We started running very low on food. We were both pretty hungry  losing lots of weight. Some very unusual weather conditions  very difficult ice conditions. We had decidedly low tech communications. We couldn't afford a satellite phone  so we had HF radio. You can see two ski poles sticking out of the roof of the tent. There's a wire dangling down either side. That was our HF radio antenna. We had less than two hours two way communication with the outside world in two months. Ultimately  we ran out of time. We'd skied     miles. We were just over     miles left to go to the Pole  and we'd run out of time. We were too late into the summer  the ice was starting to melt  we spoke to the Russian helicopter pilots on the radio  and they said   Look boys  you've run out of time. We've got to pick you up.  And I felt that I had failed  wholeheartedly. I was a failure. The one goal  the one dream I'd had for as long as I could remember    I hadn't even come close. And skiing along that first trip  I had two imaginary video clips that I'd replay over and over again in my mind when the going got tough  just to keep my motivation going. The first one was reaching the Pole itself. I could see vividly  I suppose  being filmed out of the door of a helicopter  there was  kind of  rock music playing in the background  and I had a ski pole with a Union Jack  you know  flying in the wind. I could see myself sticking the flag in a pole  you know    ah  glorious moment    the music kind of reaching a crescendo. The second video clip that I imagined was getting back to Heathrow airport  and I could see again  vividly  the camera flashbulbs going off  the paparazzi  the autograph hunters  the book agents coming to sign me up for a deal. And of course  neither of these things happened. We didn't get to the Pole  and we didn't have any money to pay anyone to do the PR  so no one had heard of this expedition. And I got back to Heathrow. My mum was there  my brother was there  my granddad was there    had a little Union Jack       and that was about it. I went back to live with my mum. I was physically exhausted  mentally an absolute wreck  considered myself a failure. In a huge amount of debt personally to this expedition  and lying on my mum's sofa  day in day out  watching daytime TV. My brother sent me a text message  an SMS    it was a quote from the  Simpsons.  It said   You tried your hardest and failed miserably. The lesson is  don't even try.  Fast forward three years. I did eventually get off the sofa  and start planning another expedition. This time  I wanted to go right across  on my own this time  from Russia  at the top of the map  to the North Pole  where the sort of kink in the middle is  and then on to Canada. No one has made a complete crossing of the Arctic Ocean on their own. Two Norwegians did it as a team in     . No one's done it solo. Very famous  very accomplished Italian mountaineer  Reinhold Messner  tried it in       and he was rescued after a week. He described this expedition as    times as dangerous as Everest. So for some reason  this was what I wanted to have a crack at  but I knew that even to stand a chance of getting home in one piece  let alone make it across to Canada  I had to take a radical approach. This meant everything from perfecting the sawn off  sub two gram toothbrush  to working with one of the world's leading nutritionists in developing a completely new  revolutionary nutritional strategy from scratch        calories a day. And the expedition started in February last year. Big support team. We had a film crew  a couple of logistics people with us  my girlfriend  a photographer. At first it was pretty sensible. We flew British Airways to Moscow. The next bit in Siberia to Krasnoyarsk  on a Russian internal airline called KrasAir  spelled K R A S. The next bit  we'd chartered a pretty elderly Russian plane to fly us up to a town called Khatanga  which was the sort of last bit of civilization. Our cameraman  who it turned out was a pretty nervous flier at the best of times  actually asked the pilot  before we got on the plane  how long this flight would take  and the pilot    Russian pilot    completely deadpan  replied   Six hours    if we live.  We got to Khatanga. I think the joke is that Khatanga isn't the end of the world  but you can see it from there. It was supposed to be an overnight stay. We were stuck there for    days. There was a kind of vodka fueled pay dispute between the helicopter pilots and the people that owned the helicopter  so we were stuck. We couldn't move. Finally  morning of day     we got the all clear  loaded up the helicopters    two helicopters flying in tandem    dropped me off at the edge of the pack ice. We had a frantic sort of    minutes of filming  photography  while the helicopter was still there  I did an interview on the satellite phone  and then everyone else climbed back into the helicopter  wham  the door closed  and I was alone. And I don't know if words will ever quite do that moment justice. All I could think about was running back up to the door  banging on the door  and saying   Look guys  I haven't quite thought this through.  To make things worse  you can just see the white dot up at the top right hand side of the screen  that's a full moon. Because we'd been held up in Russia  of course  the full moon brings the highest and lowest tides  when you're standing on the frozen surface of the sea  high and low tides generally mean that interesting things are going to happen    the ice is going to start moving around a bit. I was  you can see there  pulling two sledges. Grand total in all     days of food and fuel      kilos    that's almost exactly     pounds. When the ice was flat or flattish  I could just about pull both. When the ice wasn't flat  I didn't have a hope in hell. I had to pull one  leave it  and go back and get the other one. Literally scrambling through what's called pressure ice    the ice had been smashed up under the pressure of the currents of the ocean  the wind and the tides. NASA described the ice conditions last year as the worst since records began. And it's always drifting. The pack ice is always drifting. I was skiing into headwinds for nine out of the    weeks I was alone last year  and I was drifting backwards most of the time. My record was minus  .  miles. I got up in the morning  took the tent down  skied north for seven and a half hours  put the tent up  and I was two and a half miles further back than when I'd started. I literally couldn't keep up with the drift of the ice. I'm lying in the tent  getting ready to go. The weather is just appalling    oh  drifted back about five miles in the last    last night. Later in the expedition  the problem was no longer the ice. It was a lack of ice    open water. I knew this was happening. I knew the Artic was warming. I knew there was more open water. And I had a secret weapon up my sleeve. This was my little bit of bio mimicry. Polar bears on the Artic Ocean move in dead straight lines. If they come to water  they'll climb in  swim across it. So we had a dry suit developed    I worked with a team in Norway    based on a sort of survival suit    I suppose  that helicopter pilots would wear    that I could climb into. It would go on over my boots  over my mittens  it would pull up around my face   and seal pretty tightly around my face. And this meant I could ski over very thin ice  and if I fell through  it wasn't the end of the world. It also meant  if the worst came to the worst  I could actually jump in and swim across and drag the sledge over after me. Some pretty radical technology  a radical approach   but it worked perfectly. Another exciting thing we did last year was with communications technology. In       Shackleton's Endurance expedition    there was    one of his crew  a guy called Thomas Orde Lees. He said   The explorers of       if there is anything left to explore  will no doubt carry pocket wireless telephones fitted with wireless telescopes.  Well  Orde Lees guessed wrong by about eight years. This is my pocket wireless telephone  Iridium satellite phone. The wireless telescope was a digital camera I had tucked in my pocket. And every single day of the    days I was alone on the ice  I was blogging live from my tent  sending back a little diary piece  sending back information on the distance I'd covered    the ice conditions  the temperature    and a daily photo. Remember        we had less than two hours radio contact with the outside world. Last year  blogging live from an expedition that's been described as    times as dangerous as Everest. It wasn't all high tech. This is navigating in what's called a whiteout. When you get lots of mist  low cloud  the wind starts blowing the snow up. You can't see an awful lot. You can just see  there's a yellow ribbon tied to one of my ski poles. I'd navigate using the direction of the wind. So  kind of a weird combination of high tech and low tech. I got to the Pole on the   th of May. It took me    days to get there from Russia  and there is nothing there. There isn't even a pole at the Pole. There's nothing there  purely because it's sea ice. It's drifting. Stick a flag there  leave it there  pretty soon it will drift off  usually towards Canada or Greenland. I knew this  but I was expecting something. Strange mixture of feelings  it was extremely warm by this stage  a lot of open water around  and of course  elated that I'd got there under my own steam  but starting to really realize that my chances of making it all the way across to Canada  which was still     miles away  were slim at best. The only proof I've got that I was there is a blurry photo of my GPS  the little satellite navigation gadget. You can just see    there's a nine and a string of zeros here. Ninety degrees north    that is slap bang in the North Pole. I took a photo of that. Sat down on my sledge. Did a sort of video diary piece. Took a few photos. I got my satellite phone out. I warmed the battery up in my armpit. I dialed three numbers. I dialed my mum. I dialed my girlfriend. I dialed the CEO of my sponsor. And I got three voicemails. It's a special feeling. The entire planet is rotating beneath my feet. The    the whole world underneath me. I finally got through to my mum. She was at the queue of the supermarket. She started crying. She asked me to call her back. I skied on for a week past the Pole. I wanted to get as close to Canada as I could before conditions just got too dangerous to continue. This was the last day I had on the ice. When I spoke to the    my project management team  they said   Look  Ben  conditions are getting too dangerous. There are huge areas of open water just south of your position. We'd like to pick you up. Ben  could you please look for an airstrip   This was the view outside my tent when I had this fateful phone call. I'd never tried to build an airstrip before. Tony  the expedition manager  he said   Look Ben  you've got to find     meters of flat  thick safe ice.  The only bit of ice I could find    it took me    hours of skiing around trying to find an airstrip    was exactly     meters. I could measure it with my skis. I didn't tell Tony that. I didn't tell the pilots that. I thought  it'll have to do. It just about worked. A pretty dramatic landing    the plane actually passed over four times  and I was a bit worried it wasn't going to land at all. The pilot  I knew  was called Troy. I was expecting someone called Troy that did this for a living to be a pretty tough kind of guy. I was bawling my eyes out by the time the plane landed    a pretty emotional moment. So I thought  I've got to compose myself for Troy. I'm supposed to be the roughty toughty explorer type. The plane taxied up to where I was standing. The door opened. This guy jumped out. He's about that tall. He said   Hi  my name is Troy.  The co pilot was a lady called Monica. She sat there in a sort of hand knitted jumper. They were the least macho people I've ever met  but they made my day. Troy was smoking a cigarette on the ice  we took a few photos. He climbed up the ladder. He said   Just    just get in the back.  He threw his cigarette out as he got on the front  and I climbed in the back. Taxied up and down the runway a few times  just to flatten it out a bit  and he said   Right  I'm going to    I'm going to give it a go.  And he    I've now learned that this is standard practice  but it had me worried at the time. He put his hand on the throttle. You can see the control for the engines is actually on the roof of the cockpit. It's that little bar there. He put his hand on the throttle. Monica very gently put her hand sort of on top of his. I thought   God  here we go. We're  we're    this is all or nothing.  Rammed it forwards. Bounced down the runway. Just took off. One of the skis just clipped a pressure ridge at the end of the runway  banking. I could see into the cockpit  Troy battling the controls  and he just took one hand off  reached back  flipped a switch on the roof of the cockpit  and it was the  fasten seat belt  sign you can see on the wall. And only from the air did I see the big picture. Of course  when you're on the ice  you only ever see one obstacle at a time  whether it's a pressure ridge or there's a bit of water. This is probably why I didn't get into trouble about the length of my airstrip. I mean  it really was starting to break up. Why  I'm not an explorer in the traditional sense. I'm not skiing along drawing maps  everyone knows where the North Pole is. At the South Pole there's a big scientific base. There's an airstrip. There's a cafe and there's a tourist shop. For me  this is about exploring human limits  about exploring the limits of physiology  of psychology and of technology. They're the things that excite me. And it's also about potential  on a personal level. This  for me  is a chance to explore the limits    really push the limits of my own potential  see how far they stretch. And on a wider scale  it amazes me how people go through life just scratching the surface of their potential  just doing three or four or five percent of what they're truly capable of. So  on a wider scale  I hope that this journey was a chance to inspire other people to think about what they want to do with their potential  and what they want to do with the tiny amount of time we each have on this planet. That's as close as I can come to summing that up. The next question is  how do you answer the call of nature at minus     The answer  of course  to which is a trade secret    and the last question  what's next  As quickly as possible  if I have a minute left at the end  I'll go into more detail. What's next  Antarctica. It's the coldest  highest  windiest and driest continent on Earth. Late       early       there was a race to be the first to the South Pole  the heart of the Antarctic continent. If you include the coastal ice shelves  you can see that the Ross Ice Shelf    it's the big one down here    the Ross Ice Shelf is the size of France. Antarctica  if you include the ice shelves  is twice the size of Australia    it's a big place. And there's a race to get to the Pole between Amundsen  the Norwegian    Amundsen had dog sleds and huskies    and Scott  the British guy  Captain Scott. Scott had sort of ponies and some tractors and a few dogs  all of which went wrong  and Scott and his team of four people ended up on foot. They got to the Pole late January      to find a Norwegian flag already there. There was a tent  a letter to the Norwegian king. And they turned around  headed back to the coast  and all five of them died on the return journey. Since then  no one has ever skied    this was    years ago    since then  no one has ever skied from the coast of Antarctica to the Pole and back. Every South Pole expedition you may have heard about is either flown out from the Pole or has used vehicles or dogs or kites to do some kind of crossing    no one has ever made a return journey. So that's the plan. Two of us are doing it. That's pretty much it. One final thought before I get to the toilet bit  is    is  I have a    and I meant to scan this and I've forgotten    but I have a    I have a school report. I was    years old  and it's framed above my desk at home. It says   Ben lacks sufficient impetus to achieve anything worthwhile.  I think if I've learned anything  it's this  that no one else is the authority on your potential. You're the only person that decides how far you go and what you're capable of. Ladies and gentlemen  that's my story. Thank you very much. Walk around for four months with three wishes  and all the ideas will start to percolate up. I think everybody should do it    think that you've got three wishes. And what would you do  It's actually a great exercise to really drill down to the things that you feel are important  and really reflect on the world around us. And thinking that  can an individual actually do something  or come up with something  that may actually get some traction out there and make a difference  Inspired by nature    that's the theme here. And I think  quite frankly  that's where I started. I became very interested in the landscape as a Canadian. We have this Great North. And there was a pretty small population  and my father was an avid outdoorsman. So I really had a chance to experience that. And I could never really understand exactly what it was  or how it was informing me. But what I think it was telling me is that we are this transient thing that's happening  and that the nature that you see out there    the untouched shorelines  the untouched forest that I was able to see    really bring in a sense of that geological time  that this has gone on for a long time  and we're experiencing it in a different way. And that  to me  was a reference point that I think I needed to have to be able to make the work that I did. And I did go out  and I did this picture of grasses coming through in the spring  along a roadside. This rebirth of grass. And then I went out for years trying to photograph the pristine landscape. But as a fine art photographer I somehow felt that it wouldn't catch on out there  that there would be a problem with trying to make this as a fine art career. And I kept being sucked into this genre of the calendar picture  or something of that nature  and I couldn't get away from it. So I started to think of  how can I rethink the landscape  I decided to rethink the landscape as the landscape that we've transformed. I had a bit of an epiphany being lost in Pennsylvania  and I took a left turn trying to get back to the highway. And I ended up in a town called Frackville. I got out of the car  and I stood up  and it was a coal mining town. I did a     turnaround  and that became one of the most surreal landscapes I've ever seen. Totally transformed by man. And that got me to go out and look at mines like this  and go out and look at the largest industrial incursions in the landscape that I could find. And that became the baseline of what I was doing. And it also became the theme that I felt that I could hold onto  and not have to re invent myself    that this theme was large enough to become a life's work  to become something that I could sink my teeth into and just research and find out where these industries are. And I think one of the things I also wanted to say in my thanks  which I kind of missed  was to thank all the corporations who helped me get in. Because it took negotiation for almost every one of these photographs    to get into that place to make those photographs  and if it wasn't for those people letting me in at the heads of those corporations  I would have never made this body of work. So in that respect  to me  I'm not against the corporation. I own a corporation. I work with them  and I feel that we all need them and they're important. But I am also for sustainability. So there's this thing that is pulling me in both directions. And I'm not making an indictment towards what's happening here  but it is a slow progression. So I started thinking  well  we live in all these ages of man  the Stone Age  and the Iron Age  and the Copper Age. And these ages of man are still at work today. But we've become totally disconnected from them. There's something that we're not seeing there. And it's a scary thing as well. Because when we start looking at the collective appetite for our lifestyles  and what we're doing to that landscape    that  to me  is something that is a very sobering moment for me to contemplate. And through my photographs  I'm hoping to be able to engage the audiences of my work  and to come up to it and not immediately be rejected by the image. Not to say   Oh my God  what is it   but to be challenged by it    to say   Wow  this is beautiful   on one level  but on the other level   This is scary. I shouldn't be enjoying it.  Like a forbidden pleasure. And it's that forbidden pleasure that I think is what resonates out there  and it gets people to look at these things  and it gets people to enter it. And it also  in a way  defines kind of what I feel  too    that I'm drawn to have a good life. I want a house  and I want a car. But there's this consequence out there. And how do I begin to have that attraction  repulsion  It's even in my own conscience I'm having it  and here in my work  I'm trying to build that same toggle. These things that I photographed    this tire pile here had    million tires in it. It was the largest one. It was only about an hour and a half away from me  and it caught fire about four years ago. It's around Westley  California  around Modesto. And I decided to start looking at something that  to me  had    if the earlier work of looking at the landscape had a sense of lament to what we were doing to nature  in the recycling work that you're seeing here was starting to point to a direction. To me  it was our redemption. That in the recycling work that I was doing  I'm looking for a practice  a human activity that is sustainable. That if we keep putting things  through industrial and urban existence  back into the system    if we keep doing that    we can continue on. Of course  listening at the conference  there's many  many things that are coming. Bio mimicry  and there's many other things that are coming on stream    nanotechnology that may also prevent us from having to go into that landscape and tear it apart. And we all look forward to those things. But in the meantime  these things are scaling up. These things are continuing to happen. What you're looking at here    I went to Bangladesh  so I started to move away from North America  I started to look at our world globally. These images of Bangladesh came out of a radio program I was listening to. They were talking about Exxon Valdez  and that there was going to be a glut of oil tankers because of the insurance industries. And that those oil tankers needed to be decommissioned  and      was going to be the pinnacle. And I thought   My God  wouldn't that be something   To see the largest vessels of man being deconstructed by hand  literally  in third world countries. So originally I was going to go to India. And I was shut out of India because of a Greenpeace situation there  and then I was able to get into Bangladesh  and saw for the first time a third world  a view of it  that I had never actually thought was possible.     million people living in an area the size of Wisconsin    people everywhere    the pollution was intense  and the working conditions were horrible. Here you're looking at some oil fields in California  some of the biggest oil fields. And again  I started to think that    there was another epiphany    that the whole world I was living in was a result of having plentiful oil. And that  to me  was again something that I started building on  and I continued to build on. So this is a series I'm hoping to have ready in about two or three years  under the heading of  The Oil Party.  Because I think everything that we're involved in    our clothing  our cars  our roads  and everything    are directly a result. I'm going to move to some pictures of China. And for me China    I started photographing it four years ago  and China truly is a question of sustainability in my mind  not to mention that China  as well  has a great effect on the industries that I grew up around. I came out of a blue collar town  a GM town  and my father worked at GM  so I was very familiar with that kind of industry and that also informed my work. But you know  to see China and the scale at which it's evolving  is quite something. So what you see here is the Three Gorges Dam  and this is the largest dam by    percent ever attempted by man. Most of the engineers around the world left the project because they said   It's just too big.  In fact  when it did actually fill with water a year and a half ago  they were able to measure a wobble within the earth as it was spinning. It took fifteen days to fill it. So this created a reservoir     kilometers long  one of the largest reservoirs ever created. And what was also one of the bigger projects around that was moving    full size cities up out of the reservoir  and flattening all the buildings so they could make way for the ships. This is a  before and after.  So that was before. And this is like    weeks later  demolished by hand. I think    of the buildings they used dynamite  everything else was by hand. That was    weeks later. And this gives you an idea. And it was all the people who lived in those homes  were the ones that were actually taking it apart and working  and getting paid per brick to take their cities apart. And these are some of the images from that. So I spent about three trips to the Three Gorges Dam  looking at that massive transformation of a landscape. And it looks like a bombed out landscape  but it isn't. What it is  it's a landscape that is an intentional one. This is a need for power  and they're willing to go through this massive transformation  on this scale  to get that power. And again  it's actually a relief for what's going on in China because I think on the table right now  there's    nuclear power stations to be built. There hasn't been one built in North America for    years because of the  NIMBY  problem     Not In My BackYard.  But in China they're saying   No  we're putting in    in the next    years.  And coal burning furnaces are going in there for hydroelectric power literally weekly. So coal itself is probably one of the largest problems. And one of the other things that happened in the Three Gorges    a lot of the agricultural land that you see there on the left was also lost  some of the most fertile agricultural land was lost in that. And  .  to   million people were relocated  depending on whose statistics you're looking at. And this is what they were building. This is Wushan  one of the largest cities that was relocated. This is the town hall for the city. And again  the rebuilding of the city    to me  it was sad to see that they didn't really grab a lot of  I guess  what we know here  in terms of urban planning. There were no parks  there were no green spaces. Very high density living on the side of a hill. And here they had a chance to rebuild cities from the bottom up  but somehow were not connecting with them. Here is a sign that  translated  says   Obey the birth control law. Build our science  civilized and advanced idea of marriage and giving birth.  So here  if you look at this poster  it has all the trappings of Western culture. You're seeing the tuxedos  the bouquets. But what's really  to me  frightening about the picture and about this billboard is the refinery in the background. So it's like marrying up all the things that we have and it's an adaptation of our way of life  full stop. And again  when you start seeing that kind of embrace  and you start looking at them leading their rural lifestyle with a very  very small footprint and moving into an urban lifestyle with a much higher footprint  it starts to become very sobering. This is a shot in one of the biggest squares in Guangdong    and this is where a lot of migrant workers are coming in from the country. And there's about     million people in migration trying to get into urban centers at all times  and in the next    to    years  are expecting another     to     million people to migrate into the urban centers like Shanghai and the manufacturing centers. The manufacturers are    the domestics are usually    you can tell a domestic factory by the fact that they all use the same color uniforms. So this is a pink uniform at this factory. It's a shoe factory. And they have dorms for the workers. So they bring them in from the country and put them up in the dorms. This is one of the biggest shoe factories  the Yuyuan shoe factory near Shenzhen. It has        employees making shoes. This is a shift change  one of three. There's two factories of this scale in the same town. This is one with         so every lunch  there's about        coming through for lunch. They sit down  they have about    minutes. The next round comes in. It's an incredible workforce that's building there. Shanghai    I'm looking at the urban renewal in Shanghai  and this is a whole area that will be flattened and turned into skyscrapers in the next five years. What's also happening in Shanghai is    China is changing because this wouldn't have happened five years ago  for instance. This is a holdout. They're called dengzahoos    they're like pin tacks to the ground. They won't move. They're not negotiating. They're not getting enough  so they're not going to move. And so they're holding off until they get a deal with them. And they've been actually quite successful in getting better deals because most of them are getting a raw deal. They're being put out about two hours    the communities that have been around for literally hundreds of years  or maybe even thousands of years  are being broken up and spread across in the suburban areas outside of Shanghai. But these are a whole series of guys holding out in this reconstruction of Shanghai. Probably the largest urban renewal project  I think  ever attempted on the planet. And then the embrace of the things that they're replacing it with    again  one of my wishes  and I never ended up going there  was to somehow tell them that there were better ways to build a house. The kinds of collisions of styles and things were quite something  and these are called the villas. And also  like right now  they're just moving. The scaffolding is still on  and this is an e waste area  and if you looked in the foreground on the big print  you'd see that the industry    their industry    they're all recycling. So the industry's already growing around these new developments. This is a five level bridge in Shanghai. Shanghai was a very intriguing city    it's exploding on a level that I don't think any city has experienced. In fact  even Shenzhen  the economic zone    one of the first ones       years ago was about         people  and today it boasts about    to    million. So that gives you an idea of the kinds of migrations and the speed with which    this is just the taxis being built by Volkswagen. There's       of them here  and they're being built for most of the big cities  Beijing and Shanghai  Shenzhen. And this isn't even the domestic car market  this is the taxi market. And what we would see here as a suburban development    a similar thing  but they're all high rises. So they'll put    or    up at a time  and they just go up in the same way as a single family dwelling would go up here in an area. And the density is quite incredible. And one of the things in this picture that I wanted to point out is that when I saw these kinds of buildings  I was shocked to see that they're not using a central air conditioning system  every window has an air conditioner in it. And I'm sure there are people here who probably know better than I do about efficiencies  but I can't imagine that every apartment having its own air conditioner is a very efficient way to cool a building on this scale. And when you start looking at that  and then you start factoring up into a city the size of Shanghai  it's literally a forest of skyscrapers. It's breathtaking  in terms of the speed at which this city is transforming. And you can see in the foreground of this picture  it's still one of the last areas that was being held up. Right now that's all cleared out    this was done about eight months ago    and high rises are now going up into that central spot. So a skyscraper is built  literally  overnight in Shanghai. Most recently I went in  and I started looking at some of the biggest industries in China. And this is Baosteel  right outside of Shanghai. This is the coal supply for the steel factory       square kilometers. It's an incredibly massive operation  I think        workers  five cupolas  and the sixth one's coming in here. So they're building very large blast furnaces to try to deal with the demand for steel in China. So this is three of the visible blast furnaces within that shot. And again  looking at these images  there's this constant  like  haze that you're seeing. This is going to show you  real time  an assembler. It's a circuit breaker.    hours a day at this speed. I think one of the issues that we here are facing with China  is that they're using a lot of the latest production technology. In that one  there were     people that worked on the floor. And I asked the manager to point out five of your fastest producers  and then I went and looked at each one of them for about    or    minutes  and picked this one woman. And it was just lightning fast  the way she was working was almost unbelievable. But that is the trick that they've got right now  that they're winning with  is that they're using all the latest technologies and extrusion machines  and bringing all the components into play  but the assembly is where they're actually bringing in    the country workers are very willing to work. They want to work. There's a massive backlog of people wanting their jobs. That condition's going to be there for the next    to    years if they realize what they want  which is  you know      to     million more people coming into the cities. In this particular case    this is the assembly line that you saw  this is a shot of it. I had to use a very small aperture to get the depth of field. I had to have them freeze for    seconds to get this shot. It took me five fake tries because they were just going. To slow them down was literally impossible. They were just wound up doing these things all day long  until the manager had to  with a stern voice  say   Okay  everybody freeze.  It wasn't too bad  but they're driven to produce these things at an incredible rate. This is a textile mill doing synthetic silk  an oil byproduct. And what you're seeing here is  again  one of the most state of the art textile mills. There are     of these machines  they're worth about         dollars each. So you have about    people running this  and they're just inspecting it    and they're just walking the lines. The machines are all running  absolutely incredible to see what the scale of industries are. And I started getting in further and further into the factories. And that's a diptych. I do a lot of pairings to try and get the sense of scale in these places. This is a line where they get the threads and they wind the threads together  pre going into the textile mills. Here's something that's far more labor intensive  which is the making of shoes. This floor has about       workers on this floor. The company itself had about        employees  and they're doing domestic shoes. It was very hard to get into the international companies because I had to get permission from companies like Nike and Adidas  and that's very hard to get. And they don't want to let me in. But the domestic was much easier to do. It just gives you a sense of  again    and that's where  really  the whole migration of jobs started going over to China and making the shoes. Nike was one of the early ones. It was such a high labor component to it that it made a lot of sense to go after that labor market. This is a high tech mobile phone  Bird mobile phone  one of the largest mobile makers in China. I think mobile phone companies are popping up  literally  on a weekly basis  and they have an explosive growth in mobile phones. This is a textile where they're doing shirts    Youngor  the biggest shirt factory and clothing factory in China. And this next shot here is one of the lunchrooms. Everything is very efficient. While setting up this shot  people on average would spend eight to    minutes having a lunch. This was one of the biggest factories I've ever seen. They make coffeemakers here  the biggest coffeemaker and the biggest iron makers    they make    million of them in the world. There's        employees. This one factory    and they had several of them    is half a kilometer long. These are just recently shot    I just came back about a month ago  so you're the first ones to be seeing these  these new factory pictures I've taken. So it's taken me almost a year to gain access into these places. The other aspect of what's happening in China is that there's a real need for materials there. So a lot of the recycled materials that are collected here are being recycled and taken to China by ships. That's cubed metal. This is armatures  electrical armatures  where they're getting the copper and the high end steel from electrical motors out  and recycling them. This is certainly connected to California and Silicon Valley. But this is what happens to most of the computers. Fifty percent of the world's computers end up in China to be recycled. It's referred to as  e waste  there. And it is a bit of a problem. The way they recycle the boards is that they actually use the coal briquettes  which are used all through China  but they heat up the boards  and with pairs of pliers they pull off all the components. They're trying to get all the valued metals out of those components. But the toxic smells    when you come into a town that's actually doing this kind of burning of the boards  you can smell it a good five or    kilometers before you get there. Here's another operation. It's all cottage industries  so it's not big places    it's all in people's front porches  in their backyards  even in their homes they're burning boards  if there's a concern for somebody coming by    because it is considered in China to be illegal  doing it  but they can't stop the product from coming in. This portrait    I'm not usually known for portraits  but I couldn't resist this one  where she's been through Mao  and she's been through the Great Leap Forward  and the Cultural Revolution  and now she's sitting on her porch with this e waste beside her. It's quite something. This is a road where it's been shored up by computer boards in one of the biggest towns where they're recycling. So that's the photographs that I wanted to show you. I want to dedicate my wishes to my two girls. They've been sitting on my shoulder the whole time while I've been thinking. One's Megan  the one of the right  and Katja there. And to me the whole notion    the things I'm photographing are out of a great concern about the scale of our progress and what we call progress. And as much as there are great things around the corner    and it's palpable in this room    of all of the things that are just about to break that can solve so many problems  I'm really hoping that those things will spread around the world and will start to have a positive effect. And it isn't something that isn't just affecting our world  but it starts to go up    because I think we can start correcting our footprint and bring it down    but there's a growing footprint that's happening in Asia  and is growing at a rapid  rapid rate  and so I don't think we can equalize it. So ultimately the strategy  I think  here is that we have to be very concerned about their evolution  because it is going to be connected to our evolution as well. So part of my thinking  and part of my wishes  is sitting with these thoughts in mind  and thinking about   How is their life going to be when they want to have children  or when they're ready to get married    years from now    or whatever     years from now   And to me that has been the core behind most of my thinking    in my work  and also for this incredible chance to have some wishes. Wish one  world changing. I want to use my images to persuade millions of people to join in the global conversation on sustainability. And it is through communications today that I believe that that is not an unreal idea. Oh  and I went in search    I wanted to put what I had in mind  hitch it onto something. I didn't want a wish just to start from nowhere. One of them I'm starting from almost nothing  but the other one  I wanted to find out what's going on that's working right now. And Worldchanging.com is a fantastic blog  and that blog is now being visited by close to half a million people a month. And it just started about    months ago. And the beauty of what's going on there is that the tone of the conversation is the tone that I like. What they're doing there is that they're not    I think the environmental movement has failed in that it's used the stick too much  it's used the apocalyptic tone too much  it hasn't sold the positive aspects of being environmentally concerned and trying to pull us out. Whereas this conversation that is going on in this blog is about positive movements  about how to change our world in a better way  quickly. And it's looking at technology  and it's looking at new energy saving devices  and it's looking at how to rethink and how to re strategize the movement towards sustainability. And so for me  one of the things that I thought would be to put some of my work in the service of promoting the Worldchanging.com website. Some of you might know  he's a TEDster    Stephen Sagmeister and I are working on some layouts. And this is still in preliminary stages  these aren't the finals. But these images  with Worldchanging.com  can be placed into any kind of media. They could be posted through the Web  they could be used as a billboard or a bus shelter  or anything of that nature. So we're looking at this as trying to build out. And what we ended up discussing was that in most media you get mostly an image with a lot of text  and the text is blasted all over. What was unusual  according to Stephen  is less than five percent of ads are actually leading with image. And so in this case  because it's about a lot of these images and what they represent  and the kinds of questions they bring up  that we thought letting the images play out and bring someone to say   Well  what's Worldchanging.com  with these images  have to do   And hopefully inspire people to go to that website. So Worldchanging.com  and building that blog  and it is a blog  and I'm hoping that it isn't    I don't see it as the kind of blog where we're all going to follow each other to death. This one is one that will spoke out  and will go out  and to start reaching. Because right now there's conversations in India  in China  in South America    there's entries coming from all around the world. I think there's a chance to have a dialogue  a conversation about sustainability at Worldchanging.com. And anything that you can do to promote that would be fantastic. Wish two is more of the bottom up  ground up one that I'm trying to work with. And this one is  I wish to launch a groundbreaking competition that motivates kids to invest ideas on  and invent ideas on  sustainability. And one of the things that came out    Allison  who actually nominated me  said something earlier on in a brainstorming. She said that recycling in Canada had a fantastic entry into our psyche through kids between grade four and six. And you think about it  you know  grade four    my wife and I  we say age seven is the age of reason  so they're into the age of reason. And they're pre puberty. So it's this great window where they actually are    you can influence them. You know what happens at puberty  You know  we know that from earlier presentations. So my thinking here is that we try to motivate those kids to start driving home ideas. Let them understand what sustainability is  and that they have a vested interest in it to happen. And one of the ways I thought of doing it is to use my prize  so I would take        or        dollars of the winnings  and the rest is going to be to manage this project  but to use that as prizes for kids to get into their hands. But the other thing that I thought would be fantastic was to create these    call them  prize targets.  And so one could be for the best sustainable idea for an in school project  the best one for a household project  or it could be the best community project for sustainability. And I also thought there should be a nice prize for the best artwork for  In My World.  And what would happen    it's a scalable thing. And if we can get people to put in things    whether it's equipment  like a media lab  or money to make the prize significant enough    and to open it up to all the schools that are public schools  or schools that are with kids that age  and make it a wide open competition for them to go after those prizes and to submit them. And the prize has to be a verifiable thing  so it's not about just ideas. The art pieces are about the ideas and how they present them and do them  but the actual things have to be verifiable. In that way  what's happening is that we're motivating a certain age group to start thinking. And they're going to push that up  from the bottom    up into  I believe  into the households. And parents will be reacting to it  and trying to help them with the projects. And I think it starts to motivate the whole idea towards sustainability in a very positive way  and starts to teach them. They know about recycling now  but they don't really  I think  get sustainability in all the things  and the energy footprint  and how that matters. And to teach them  to me  would be a fantastic wish  and it would be something that I would certainly put my shoulder into. And again  in  In My World   the competition    we would use the artwork that comes in from that competition to promote it. And I like the words   in my world   because it gives possession of the world to the person who's doing it. It is my world  it's not someone else's. I want to help it  I want to do something with it. So I think it has a great opportunity to engage the imaginations    and great ideas  I think  come from kids    and engage their imagination into a project  and do something for schools. I think all schools could use extra equipment  extra cash    it's going to be an incentive for them to do that. And these are some of the ideas in terms of where we could possibly put in some promotion for  In My World.  And wish three is  Imax film. So I was told I should do one for myself  and I've always wanted to actually get involved with doing something. And the scale of my work  and the kinds of ideas I'm playing with    when I first saw an Imax film  I almost immediately thought   There's a real resonance between what I'm trying to do and the scale of what I try to do as a photographer.  And I think there's a real possibility to reach new audiences if I had a chance. So I'm looking  really  for a mentor  because I just had my birthday. I'm     and I don't have time to go back to school right now    I'm too busy. So I need somebody who can put me on a quick catch up course on how to do something like that  and lead me through the maze of how one does something like this. That would be fantastic. So those are my three wishes. I'm going to discuss with you three of my inventions that can have an effect on    to a     million people  which we will hope to see happen. We discussed  in the prior film  some of the old things that we did  like stents and insulin pumps for the diabetic. And I'd like to talk very briefly about three new inventions that will change the lives of many people. At the present time  it takes an average of three hours after the first symptoms of a heart attack are recognized by the patient  before that patient arrives at an emergency room. And people with silent ischemia    which  translated into English  means they don't have any symptoms    it takes even longer for them to get to the hospital. The AMI  Acute Myocardial Infarction  which is a doctor's big word so they can charge you more money       means a heart attack. Annual incidence   .  million Americans. Mortality          people dying each year. About half of them           have permanent damage to their heart that will cause them to have very bad problems later on. Thus         people either have died or have significant damage to their heart muscle. Symptoms are often denied by the patient  particularly us men  because we are very brave. We are very brave  and we don't want to admit that I'm having a hell of a chest pain. Then  approximately    percent of all patients never have any symptoms. What are we going to do about them  How can we save their lives  It's particularly true of diabetics and elderly women. Well  what is needed for the earliest possible warning of a heart attack  A means to determine if there's a complete blockage of a coronary artery. That  ladies and gentlemen  is a heart attack. The means consist of noting something a little technical  ST segment elevation of the electrogram    translated into English  that means that if there's an electrical signal in the heart  and one part of the ECG    which we call the ST segment    elevates  that is a sure sign of a heart attack. And if we had a computer put into the body of a person who's at risk  we could know  before they even have symptoms  that they're having a heart attack  to save their life. Well  the doctor can program a level of this ST elevation voltage that will trigger an emergency alarm  vibration like your cell phone  but right by your clavicle bone. And when it goes beep  beep  beep  you better do something about it  because if you want to live you have to get to some medical treatment. So we have to try these devices out because the FDA won't just let us use them on people unless we try it out first  and the best model for this happens to be pigs. And what we tried with the pig was external electrodes on the skin  like you see in an emergency room  and I'm going to show you why they don't work very well. And then we put a lead  which is a wire  in the right ventricle inside the heart  which does the electrogram  which is the signal voltage from inside the heart. Well  with the pig  at the baseline  before we blocked the pig's artery to simulate a heart attack  that was the signal. After    seconds  even an expert couldn't tell the difference  and after three minutes    well  if you really studied it  you'd see a difference. But what happened when we looked inside the pig's heart  to the electrogram  There was the baseline    first of all  a much bigger and more reliable signal. Second of all  I'll bet even you people who are untrained can see the difference  and we see here an ST segment elevation right after this sharp line. Look at the difference there. It doesn't take much    every layperson could see that difference  and computers can be programmed to easily detect it. Then  look at that after three minutes. We see that the signal that's actually in the heart  we can use it to tell people that they're having a heart attack even before they have symptoms so we can save their life. Then we tried it with my son  Dr. Tim Fischell  we tried it on some human patients who had to have a stent put in. Well  he kept the balloon filled to block the artery  to simulate a blockage  which is what a heart attack is. And it's not hard to see that    the baseline is the first picture on the upper left. Next to it  at    seconds  you see this rise here  then this rise    that's the ST elevation. And if we had a computer that could detect it  we could tell you you're having a heart attack so early it could save your life and prevent congestive heart failure. And then he did it again. We filled the balloon again a few minutes later and here you see  even after    seconds  a great rise in this piece  which we can have computers inside  under your chest like a pacemaker  with a wire into your heart like a pacemaker. And computers don't go to sleep. We have a little battery and on this little battery that computer will run for five years without needing replacement. What does the system look like  Well  on the left is the IMD  which is Implantable Medical Device  and tonight in the tent you can see it    they've exhibited it. It's about this big  the size of a pacemaker. It's implanted with very conventional techniques. And the EXD is an External Device that you can have on your night table. It'll wake you up and tell you to get your tail to the emergency room when the thing goes off because  if you don't  you're in deep doo doo. And then  finally  a programmer that will set the level of the stimulation  which is the level which says you are having a heart attack. The FDA says  OK  test this final device after it's built in some animal  which we said is a pig  so we had to get this pig to have a heart attack. And when you go to the farmyard  you can't easily get pigs to have heart attacks  so we said  well  we're experts in stents. Tonight you'll see some of our invented stents. We said  so we'll put in a stent  but we're not going to put in a stent that we'd put in people. We're putting in a copper stent  and this copper stent erodes the artery and causes heart attacks. That's not very nice  but  after all  we had to find out what the answer is. So we took two copper stents and we put it in the artery of this pig  and let me show you the result that's very gratifying as far as people who have heart disease are concerned. So there it was  Thursday morning we stopped the pig's medication and there is his electrogram  the signal from inside the pig's heart coming out by radio telemetry. Then  on Friday at       he began to get certain signs  which later we had the pig run around    I'm not going to go into this early stage. But look what happened at       after we removed this pig's medication that kept him from having a heart attack. Any one of you now is an expert on ST elevation. Can you see it there  Can you see it in the picture after the big rise of the QRS    you see ST elevation  This pig at       was having a heart attack. What happens after you have the heart attack  this blockage  Your rhythm becomes irregular  and that's what happened    minutes later. Then  ventricular fibrillation  the heart quivers instead of beats    this is just before death of the pig    and then the pig died  it went flat line. But we had a little bit over an hour where we could've saved this pig's life. Well  because of the FDA  we didn't save the pig's life  because we need to do this type of animal research for humans. But when it comes to the sake of a human  we can save their life. We can save the lives of people who are at high risk for a heart attack. What is the response to acute myocardial infarction  a heart attack  today  Well  you feel some chest pain or indigestion. It's not all that bad  you decide not to do anything. Several hours pass and it gets worse  and even the man won't ignore it. Finally  you go to the emergency room. You wait as burns and other critical patients are treated  because    percent of the patients who go to an emergency room with chest pains don't have AMI  so you're not taken very seriously. They finally see you. It takes more time to get your electrocardiogram on your skin and diagnose it  and it's hard to do because they don't have the baseline data  which the computer we put in you gets. Finally  if you're lucky  you are treated in three or four hours after the incident  but the heart muscle has died. And that is the typical treatment in the advanced world    not Africa    that's the typical treatment in the advanced world today. So we developed the AngelMed Guardian System and we have a device inside this patient  called the Implanted AngelMed Guardian. And when you have a blockage  the alarm goes off and it sends the alarm and the electrogram to an external device  which gets your baseline electrogram from    hours ago and the one that caused the alarm  so you can take it to the emergency room and show them  and say  take care of me right away. Then it goes to a network operations center  where they get your data from your patient database that's been put in at some central location  say  in the United States. Then it goes to a diagnostic center  and within one minute of your heart attack  your signal appears on the screen of a computer and the computer analyzes what your problem is. And the person who's there  the medical practitioner  calls you    this is also a cell phone    and says   Mr. Smith  you're in deep doo doo  you have a problem. We've called the ambulance. The ambulance is on the way. It'll pick you up  and then we're going to call your doctor  tell him about it. We're going to send him the signal that we have  that says you have a heart attack  and we're going to send the signal to the hospital and we're going to have it analyzed there  and there you're going to be with your doctor and you'll be taken care of so you won't die of a heart attack.  That's the first invention that I wanted to describe. And now I want to talk about something entirely different. At first I didn't think migraine headaches were a big problem because I'd never had a migraine headache  but then I spoke to some people who have three or four every week of their life  and their lives are being totally ruined by it. We have a mission statement for our company doing migraine  which is   Prevent or ameliorate migraine headaches by the application of a safe  controlled magnetic pulse applied  as needed  by the patient.  Now  you're probably very few physicists here. If you're a physicist you'd know there's a certain Faraday's Law  which says if I apply a magnetic pulse on salt water    that's your brains by the way    it'll generate electric currents  and the electric current in the brain can erase a migraine headache. That's what we have discovered. So here's a picture of what we're doing. The patients who have a migraine preceded by an aura have a band of excited neurons    that's shown in red    that moves at three to five millimeters a minute towards the mid brain. And when it hits the mid brain  that's when the headache begins. There's this migraine that is preceded by a visual aura  and this visual aura  by the way    and I'll show you a picture    but it sort of begins with little dancing lights  gets bigger and bigger until it fills your whole visual field. And what we tried was this  here is a device called the Cadwell Model MES  . Weighs about    pounds  has a wire about an inch in diameter. And here's one of the patients who has an aura and always has a headache  bad one  after the aura. What do we do  This is what an aura looks like. It's sort of funny dancing lights  shown there on the left and right side. And that's a fully developed visual aura  as we see on top. In the middle  our experimentalist  the neurologist  who said   I'm going to move this down a little and I'm going to erase half your aura.  And  by God  the neurologist did erase it  and that's the middle picture  half of the aura erased by a short magnetic pulse. What does that mean  That means that the magnetic pulse is generating an electric current that's interfering with the erroneous electrical activity in the brain. And finally he says   OK  now I'm going to      all of the aura get erased with an appropriately placed magnetic pulse. What is the result  We designed a magnetic depolarizer that looks like this  that you could have    a lady  in her pocket book    and when you get an aura you can try it and see how it works. Well  the next thing they have to show is what was on ABC News  Channel    last week in New York City  in the    o'clock news. Anchor  For anyone who suffers from migraine headaches    and there are    million Americans who do    tonight  a possible answer. Eyewitness news reporter Stacy Sager tonight  with a small and portable machine that literally zaps your migraines away. Christina Sidebottom  Well  my first reaction was that it was    looked awfully gun like  and it was very strange. Stacy Sager  But for Christina Sidebottom  almost anything was worth trying if it could stop a migraine. It may look silly or even frightening as you walk around with it in your purse  but researchers here in Ohio organizing clinical trials for this migraine zapper  say it is scientifically sound    that  in fact  when the average person gets a migraine  it's caused by something similar to an electrical impulse. The zapper creates a magnetic field to counteract that. Yousef Mohammed  In other words  we're treating electricity with electricity  rather than treating electricity with the chemicals that we're using nowadays. SS  But is it safe to use everyday  Experts say the research has actually been around for more than a decade  and more long term studies need to be done. Christina now swears by it. CS  It's been the most wonderful thing for my migraine. SS  Researchers are hoping to present their studies to the FDA this summer. Robert Fischell  And that is the invention to treat migraines. You see  the problem is     million Americans have migraine headaches  and we need a means to treat it  and I think that we now have it. And this is the first device that we did  and I'm going to talk about my second wish  which has something to do with this. Our conclusions from our studies so far  at three research centers  is there is a marked improvement in pain levels after using it just once. The most severe headaches responded better after we did it several times  and the unexpected finding indicates that even established headaches  not only those with aura  get treated and get diminished. And auras can be erased and the migraine  then  does not occur. And that is the migraine invention that we are talking about and that we are working on. The third and last invention began with an idea. Epilepsy can best be treated by responsive electrical stimulation. Now  why do we use    add on  nearly  an epileptic focus  Now  unfortunately  us technical people  unlike Mr. Bono  have to get into all these technical words. Well   responsive electrical stimulation  means that we sense  at a place in your brain which is called an  epileptic focus   which is where the epileptic seizure begins    we sense there  that it's going to happen  and then we respond by applying an electrical energy at that spot  which erases the errant signal so that you don't get the clinical manifestations of the migraine headache. We use current pacemaker defibrillator technology that's used for the heart. We thought we could adapt it for the brain. The device could be implanted under the scalp to be totally hidden and avoid wire breakage  which occurs if you put it in the chest and you try to move your neck around. Form a company to develop a neuro pacemaker for epilepsy  as well as other diseases of the brain  because all diseases of the brain are a result of some electrical malfunction in it  that causes many  if not all  of brain disorders. We formed a company called NeuroPace and we started work on responsive neurostimulation  and this is a picture of what the device looked like  that's placed into the cranial bone. This is probably a better picture. Here we have our device in which we put in a frame. There's a cut made in the scalp  it's opened  the neurosurgeon has a template  he marks it around  and uses a dental burr to remove a piece of the cranial bone exactly the size of our device. And tonight  you'll be able to see the device in the tent. And then with four screws  we put in a frame  then we snap in the device and we run with wires    the one shown in green will go to the surface of the brain with electrodes  to the epileptic focus  the origin of the epilepsy  where we can sense the electrical signal and have computer analysis that tells us when to hit it with some electrical current to prevent the clinical manifestation of the seizure. In the blue wire  we see what's called a deep brain electrode. If that's the source of the epilepsy  we can attack that as well. The comprehensive solution  this is the device  it's about one inches by two inches and  oddly enough  just the thickness of most cranial bones. The advantages of responsive neurostimulation  It can detect and terminate seizures before the clinical symptoms occur  provide stimulation only when needed  can be turned off if seizures disappear  it has minimal side effects    as a matter of fact  in all our clinical trials to date  we've seen no side effects in the    or so patients in whom it's been implanted    and it's invisible  cosmetically hidden  so  if you have epilepsy and you have the device  no one will know it because you can't tell that it's there. And this shows what an electroencephalogram is  and on the left is the signal of a spontaneous seizure of one of the patients. Then we stimulated  and you see how that heavy black line and then you see the electroencephalogram signal going to normal  which means they did not get the epileptic seizure. That concludes my discussion of epilepsy  which is the third invention that I want to discuss here this afternoon. I have three wishes. Well  I can't do much about Africa. I'm a tech  I'm into medical gadgetry  which is mostly high tech stuff like Mr. Bono talked about. The first wish is to use the epilepsy responsive neurostimulator  called RNS  for Responsive NeuroStimulator    that's a brilliant acronym    for the treatment of other brain disorders. Well  if we're going to do it for epilepsy  why the hell not try it for something else  Then you saw what that device looked like  that the woman was using to fix her migraines  I tell you this  that's something which some research engineer like me would concoct  not a real designer of good equipment. We want to have some people  who really know how to do this  perform human engineering studies to develop the optimum design for the portable device for treating migraine headaches. And some of the sponsors of this TED meeting are such organizations. Then we're going to challenge the TED attendees to come up with a way to improve health care in the USA  where we have problems that Africa doesn't have. And by reducing malpractice litigation    malpractice litigation is not an African problem  it's an American problem. So  to get quickly to my first wish    the brain operates by electrical signals. If the electrical signals create a brain disorder  electro stimulation can overcome that disorder by acting on the brain's neurons. In other words  if you've screwed up electrical signals  maybe  by putting other electrical signals from a computer in the brain  we can counteract that. A signal in the brain that triggers brain dysfunction might be sensed as a trigger for electro stimulation like we're doing with epilepsy. But even if there is no signal  electro stimulation of an appropriate part of the brain can turn off a brain disorder. And consider treating psychotic disorders    and I want this involved with the TED group    such as obsessive compulsive disorder that  presently  is not well treated with drugs  and includes five million Americans. And Mr. Fischer  and his group at NeuroPace  and myself believe that we can have a dramatic effect in improving OCD in America and in the world. That is the first wish. The second wish is  at the present time  the clinical trials of transcranial magnetic stimulators    that's what TMS means  device to treat migraine headaches    appears to be quite successful. Well  that's the good news. The present portable device is far from optimally designed  both as to human factors as appearance. I think she said it looks like a gun. A lot of people don't like guns. Engage a company having prior successes for human factors engineering and industrial design to optimize the design of the first portable TMS device that will be sold to the patients who have migraine headaches. And that is the second wish. And  of the         dollar prize money  that TED was so generous to give me  I am donating        dollars to the NeuroPace people to get on with the treatment of OCD  obsessive compulsive disorder  and I'm making another        available for a company to optimize the design of the device for migraines. And that's how I'll use my         dollar prize money. Well  the third and final wish is somewhat    unfortunately  it's much more complicated because it involves lawyers. Well  medical malpractice litigation in the US has escalated the cost of malpractice insurance  so that competent physicians are leaving their practice. Lawyers take cases on contingency with the hope of a big share of a big settlement by a sympathetic jury  because this patient really ended up badly. The high cost of health care in the US is partly due to litigation and insurance costs. I've seen pictures  graphs in today's USA Today showing it skyrocketing out of control  and this is one factor. Well  how can the TED community help with this situation  I have a couple of ideas to begin with. As a starting point for discussion with the TED group  a major part of the problem is the nature of the written extent of informed consent that the patient or spouse must read and sign. For example  I asked the epilepsy people what are they using for informed consent. Would you believe     pages  single space  the patient has to read before they're in our trial to cure their epilepsy  What do you think someone has at the end of reading    single spaced pages  They don't understand what the hell it's about. That's the present system. How about making a video  We have entertainment people here  we have people who know how to do videos  with visual presentation of the anatomy and procedure done with animation. Everybody knows that we can do better with a visual thing that can be interactive with the patient  where they see the video and they're being videoed and they press  do you understand this  No  I don't. Well  then let's go to a simpler explanation. Then there's a simpler one and  oh yes  I understand that. Well  press the button and you're on record  you understand. And that is one of the ideas. Now  also a video is done of the patient or spouse and medical presenter  with the patient agreeing that he understands the procedure to be done  including all the possible failure modes. The patient or spouse agrees not to file a lawsuit if one of the known procedure failures occurs. Now  in America  in fact  you cannot give up your right to trial by jury. However  if a video is there that everything was explained to you  and you have it all in the video file  it'll be much less likely that some hotshot lawyer will take this case on contingency  because it won't be nearly as good a case. If a medical error occurs  the patient or spouse agrees to a settlement for fair compensation by arbitration instead of going to court. That would save hundreds of millions of dollars in legal costs in the United States and would decrease the cost of medicine for everyone. These are just some starting points. And  so there  that's the end of all my wishes. I wish I had more wishes but three is what I've got and there they are. Well  as Alexander Graham Bell famously said on his first successful telephone call   Hello  is that Domino's Pizza   I just really want to thank you very much. As another famous man  Jerry Garcia  said   What a strange  long trip.  And he should have said   What a strange  long trip it's about to become.  At this very moment  you are viewing my upper half. My lower half is appearing at a different conference in a different country. You can  it turns out  be in two places at once. But still  I'm sorry I can't be with you in person. I'll explain at another time. And though I'm a rock star  I just want to assure you that none of my wishes will include a hot tub. But what really turns me on about technology is not just the ability to get more songs on MP  players. The revolution    this revolution    is much bigger than that. I hope  I believe. What turns me on about the digital age  what excites me personally  is that you have closed the gap between dreaming and doing. You see  it used to be that if you wanted to make a record of a song  you needed a studio and a producer. Now  you need a laptop. If you wanted to make a film  you needed a mass of equipment and a Hollywood budget. Now  you need a camera that fits in your palm  and a couple of bucks for a blank DVD. Imagination has been decoupled from the old constraints. And that really  really excites me. I'm excited when I glimpse that kind of thinking writ large. What I would like to see is idealism decoupled from all constraints. Political  economic  psychological  whatever. The geopolitical world has got a lot to learn from the digital world. From the ease with which you swept away obstacles that no one knew could even be budged. And that's actually what I'd like to talk about today. First  though  I should probably explain why  and how  I got to this place. It's a journey that started    years ago. You may remember that song   We Are the World   or   Do They Know It's Christmas   Band Aid  Live Aid. Another very tall  grizzled rock star  my friend Sir Bob Geldof  issued a challenge to  feed the world.  It was a great moment  and it utterly changed my life. That summer  my wife  Ali  and myself went to Ethiopia. We went on the quiet to see for ourselves what was going on. We lived in Ethiopia for a month  working at an orphanage. The children had a name for me. They called me   The girl with the beard.  Don't ask. Anyway  we found Africa to be a magical place. Big skies  big hearts  big  shining continent. Beautiful  royal people. Anybody who ever gave anything to Africa got a lot more back. Ethiopia didn't just blow my mind  it opened my mind. Anyway  on our last day at this orphanage a man handed me his baby and said   Would you take my son with you   He knew  in Ireland  that his son would live  and that in Ethiopia  his son would die. It was the middle of that awful famine. Well  I turned him down. And it was a funny kind of sick feeling  but I turned him down. And it's a feeling I can't ever quite forget. And in that moment  I started this journey. In that moment  I became the worst thing of all  I became a rock star with a cause.  Laughter  Except this isn't the cause  is it  Six and a half thousand Africans dying every single day from AIDS    a preventable  treatable disease    for lack of drugs we can get in any pharmacy. That's not a cause. That's an emergency.    million AIDS orphans in Africa     million by the end of the decade. That's not a cause. That's an emergency. Today  every day        more Africans will catch HIV because of stigmatization and lack of education. That's not a cause. That's an emergency. So what we're talking about here is human rights. The right to live like a human. The right to live  period. And what we're facing in Africa is an unprecedented threat to human dignity and equality. The next thing I'd like to be clear about is what this problem is  and what this problem isn't. Because this is not all about charity. This is about justice. Really. This is not about charity. This is about justice. That's right. And that's too bad  because we're very good at charity. Americans  like Irish people  are good at it. Even the poorest neighborhoods give more than they can afford. We like to give  and we give a lot. Look at the response to the tsunami    it's inspiring. But justice is a tougher standard than charity. You see  Africa makes a fool of our idea of justice. It makes a farce of our idea of equality. It mocks our pieties. It doubts our concern. It questions our commitment. Because there is no way we can look at what's happening in Africa  and if we're honest  conclude that it would ever be allowed to happen anywhere else. As you heard in the film  anywhere else  not here. Not here  not in America  not in Europe. In fact  a head of state that you're all familiar with admitted this to me. And it's really true. There is no chance this kind of hemorrhaging of human life would be accepted anywhere else other than Africa. Africa is a continent in flames. And deep down  if we really accepted that Africans were equal to us  we would all do more to put the fire out. We're standing around with watering cans  when what we really need is the fire brigade. You see  it's not as dramatic as the tsunami. It's crazy  really  when you think about it. Does stuff have to look like an action movie these days to exist in the front of our brain  The slow extinguishing of countless lives is just not dramatic enough  it would appear. Catastrophes that we can avert are not as interesting as ones we could avert. Funny  that. Anyway  I believe that that kind of thinking offends the intellectual rigor in this room. Six and a half thousand people dying a day in Africa may be Africa's crisis  but the fact that it's not on the nightly news  that we in Europe  or you in America  are not treating it like an emergency    I want to argue with you tonight that that's our crisis. I want to argue that though Africa is not the front line in the war against terror  it could be soon. Every week  religious extremists take another African village. They're attempting to bring order to chaos. Well  why aren't we  Poverty breeds despair. We know this. Despair breeds violence. We know this. In turbulent times  isn't it cheaper  and smarter  to make friends out of potential enemies than to defend yourself against them later   The war against terror is bound up in the war against poverty.  And I didn't say that. Colin Powell said that. Now when the military are telling us that this is a war that cannot be won by military might alone  maybe we should listen. There's an opportunity here  and it's real. It's not spin. It's not wishful thinking. The problems facing the developing world afford us in the developed world a chance to re describe ourselves to the world. We will not only transform other people's lives  but we will also transform the way those other lives see us. And that might be smart in these nervous  dangerous times. Don't you think that on a purely commercial level  that anti retroviral drugs are great advertisements for Western ingenuity and technology  Doesn't compassion look well on us  And let's cut the crap for a second. In certain quarters of the world  brand EU  brand USA  is not at its shiniest. The neon sign is fizzing and cracking. Someone's put a brick through the window. The regional branch managers are getting nervous. Never before have we in the west been so scrutinized. Our values  do we have any  Our credibility  These things are under attack around the world. Brand USA could use some polishing. And I say that as a fan  you know  As a person who buys the products. But think about it. More anti retrovirals make sense. But that's just the easy part  or ought to be. But equality for Africa    that's a big  expensive idea. You see  the scale of the suffering numbs us into a kind of indifference. What on earth can we all do about this  Well  much more than we think. We can't fix every problem  but the ones we can  I want to argue  we must. And because we can  we must. This is the straight truth  the righteous truth. It is not a theory. The fact is that ours is the first generation that can look disease and extreme poverty in the eye  look across the ocean to Africa  and say this  and mean it  we do not have to stand for this. A whole continent written off    we do not have to stand for this. And let me say this without a trace of irony    before I back it up to a bunch of ex hippies. Forget the '  s. We can change the world. I can't  you can't  as individuals  but we can change the world. I really believe that  the people in this room. Look at the Gates Foundation. They've done incredible stuff  unbelievable stuff. But working together  we can actually change the world. We can turn the inevitable outcomes  and transform the quality of life for millions of lives who look and feel rather like us  when you're up close. I'm sorry to laugh here  but you do look so different than you did in Haight Ashbury in the '  s. But I want to argue that this is the moment that you are designed for. It is the flowering of the seeds you planted in earlier  headier days. Ideas that you gestated in your youth. This is what excites me. This room was born for this moment  is really what I want to say to you tonight. Most of you started out wanting to change the world  didn't you  Most of you did  the digital world. Well  now  actually because of you  it is possible to change the physical world. It's a fact. Economists confirm it  and they know much more than I do. So why  then  are we not pumping our fists into the air  Probably because when we admit we can do something about it  we've got to do something about it. It is a pain in the arse. This equality business is actually a pain in the arse. But for the first time in history  we have the technology  we have the know how  we have the cash  we have the life saving drugs. Do we have the will  I hope this is obvious  but I'm not a hippie. And I'm not really one for the warm  fuzzy feeling. I do not have flowers in my hair. Actually  I come from punk rock. The Clash wore big army boots  not sandals. But I know toughness when I see it. And for all the talk of peace and love on the West Coast  there was muscle to the movement that started out here. You see  idealism detached from action is just a dream. But idealism allied with pragmatism  with rolling up your sleeves and making the world bend a bit  is very exciting. It's very real. It's very strong. And it's very present in a crowd like you. Last year at DATA  this organization I helped set up  we launched a campaign to summon this spirit in the fight against AIDS and extreme poverty. We're calling it the ONE Campaign. It's based on our belief that the action of one person can change a lot  but the actions of many coming together as one can change the world. Well  we feel that now is the time to prove we're right. There are moments in history when civilization redefines itself. We believe this is one. We believe that this could be the time when the world finally decides that the wanton loss of life in Africa is just no longer acceptable. This could be the time that we finally get serious about changing the future for most people who live on planet Earth. Momentum has been building. Lurching a little  but it's building. This year is a test for us all  especially the leaders of the G  nations  who really are on the line here  with all the world in history watching. I have been  of late  disappointed with the Bush Administration. They started out with such promise on Africa. They made some really great promises  and actually have fulfilled a lot of them. But some of them they haven't. They don't feel the push from the ground  is the truth. But my disappointment has much more perspective when I talk to American people  and I hear their worries about the deficit  and the fiscal well being of their country. I understand that. But there's much more push from the ground than you'd think  if we got organized. What I try to communicate  and you can help me if you agree  is that aid for Africa is just great value for money at a time when America really needs it. Putting it in the crassest possible terms  the investment reaps huge returns. Not only in lives saved  but in goodwill  stability and security that we'll gain. So this is what I hope that you will do  if I could be so bold  and not have it deducted from my number of wishes. What I hope is that beyond individual merciful acts  that you will tell the politicians to do right by Africa  by America and by the world. Give them permission  if you like  to spend their political capital and your financial capital  your national purse on saving the lives of millions of people. That's really what I would like you to do. Because we also need your intellectual capital  your ideas  your skills  your ingenuity. And you  at this conference  are in a unique position. Some of the technologies we've been talking about  you invented them  or at least revolutionized the way that they're used. Together you have changed the zeitgeist from analog to digital  and pushed the boundaries. And we'd like you to give us that energy. Give us that kind of dreaming  that kind of doing. As I say  there're two things on the line here. There's the continent Africa. But there's also our sense of ourselves. People are starting to figure this out. Movements are springing up. Artists  politicians  pop stars  priests  CEOs  NGOs  mothers' unions  student unions. A lot of people are getting together  and working under this umbrella I told you about earlier  the ONE Campaign. I think they just have one idea in their mind  which is  where you live in the world should not determine whether you live in the world. History  like God  is watching what we do. When the history books get written  I think our age will be remembered for three things. Really  it's just three things this whole age will be remembered for. The digital revolution  yes. The war against terror  yes. And what we did or did not do to put out the fires in Africa. Some say we can't afford to. I say we can't afford not to. Thank you  thank you very much. Okay  my three wishes. The ones that TED has offered to grant. You see  if this is true  and I believe it is  that the digital world you all created has uncoupled the creative imagination from the physical constraints of matter  this should be a piece of piss. I should add that this started out as a much longer list of wishes. Most of them impossible  some of them impractical and one or two of them certainly immoral. This business  it gets to be addictive  you know what I mean  when somebody else is picking up the tab. Anyway  here's number one. I wish for you to help build a social movement of more than one million American activists for Africa. That is my first wish. I believe it's possible. A few minutes ago  I talked about all the citizens' campaigns that are springing up. You know  there's lots out there. And with this one campaign as our umbrella  my organization  DATA  and other groups  have been tapping into the energy and the enthusiasm that's out there from Hollywood into the heartland of America. We know there's more than enough energy to power this movement. We just need your help in making it happen. We want all of you here  church America  corporate America  Microsoft America  Apple America  Coke America  Pepsi America  nerd America  noisy America. We can't afford to be cool and sit this one out. I do believe if we build a movement that's one million Americans strong  we're not going to be denied. We will have the ear of Congress. We'll be the first page in Condi Rice's briefing book  and right into the Oval Office. If there's one million Americans    and I really know this    who are ready to make phone calls  who are ready to be on email  I am absolutely sure that we can actually change the course of history  literally  for the continent of Africa. Anyway  so I'd like your help in getting that signed up. I know John Gage and Sun Microsystems are already on board for this  but there's lots of you we'd like to talk to. Right  my second wish  number two. I would like one media hit for every person on the planet who is living on less than one dollar a day. That's one billion media hits. Could be on Google  could be on AOL. Steve Case  Larry  Sergey    they've done a lot already. It could be NBC. It could be ABC. Actually we're talking to ABC today about the Oscars. We have a film  produced by Jon Kamen at Radical Media. But you know  we want  we need some airtime for our ideas. We need to get the math  we need to get the statistics out to the American people. I really believe that old Truman line  that if you give the American people the facts  they'll do the right thing. And  the other thing that's important is that this is not Sally Struthers. This has to be described as an adventure  not a burden. a nurse  a teacher  a homemaker  and lives are saved. The problem is enormous. Every three seconds one person dies. Another three seconds  one more. The situation is so desperate in parts of Africa  Asia  even America  that aid groups  just as they did for the tsunami  are uniting as one  acting as one. We can beat extreme poverty  starvation  AIDS. But we need your help. One more person  letter  voice will mean the difference between life and death for millions of people. Please join us by working together. Americans have an unprecedented opportunity. We can make history. We can start to make poverty history. One  by one  by one. Please visit ONE at this address. We're not asking for your money. We're asking for your voice. Bono  All right. I wish for TED to truly show the power of information  its power to rewrite the rules and transform lives  by connecting every hospital  health clinic and school in one African country. And I would like it to be Ethiopia. I believe we can connect every school in Ethiopia  every health clinic  every hospital    we can connect to the Internet. That is my wish  my third wish. I think it's possible. I think we have the money and brains in the room to do that. And that would be a mind blowing wish to come true. I've been to Ethiopia  as I said earlier. It's actually where it all started for me. The idea that the Internet  which changed all of our lives  can transform a country    and a continent that has hardly made it to analog  let alone digital    blows my mind. But it didn't start out that way. The first long distance line from Boston to New York was used in      on the phone. It was just nine years later that Addis Ababa was connected by phone to Harare  which is     kilometers away. Since then  not that much has changed. The average waiting time to get a landline in Ethiopia is actually about seven or eight years. But wireless technology wasn't dreamt up then. Anyway  I'm Irish  and as you can see  I know how important talking is. Communication is very important for Ethiopia    will transform the country. Nurses getting better training  pharmacists being able to order supplies  doctors sharing their expertise in all aspects of medicine. It's a very  very good idea to get them wired. And that is my third and final wish for you at the TED conference. Thank you very much once again.
