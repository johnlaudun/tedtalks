In the next    minutes  I'm going to take you on a journey. And it's a journey that you and I have been on for many years now  and it began some    years ago  when humans first stepped off our planet. And in those    years  not only did we literally  physically set foot on the moon  but we have dispatched robotic spacecraft to all the planets    all eight of them    and we have landed on asteroids  we have rendezvoused with comets  and  at this point in time  we have a spacecraft on its way to Pluto  the body formerly known as a planet. And all of these robotic missions are part of a bigger human journey  a voyage to understand something  to get a sense of our cosmic place  to understand something of our origins  and how Earth  our planet  and we  living on it  came to be. And of all the places in the solar system that we might go to and search for answers to questions like this  there's Saturn. And we have been to Saturn before    we visited Saturn in the early     s    but our investigations of Saturn have become far more in depth in detail since the Cassini spacecraft  traveling across interplanetary space for seven years  glided into orbit around Saturn in the summer of       and became at that point the farthest robotic outpost that humanity had ever established around the Sun. Now  the Saturn system is a rich planetary system. It offers mystery  scientific insight and obviously splendor beyond compare  and the investigation of this system has enormous cosmic reach. In fact  just studying the rings alone  we stand to learn a lot about the discs of stars and gas that we call the spiral galaxies. And here's a beautiful picture of the Andromeda Nebula  which is our closest  largest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way. And then  here's a beautiful composite of the Whirlpool Galaxy  taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. So the journey back to Saturn is really part of and is also a metaphor for a much larger human voyage to understand the interconnectedness of everything around us  and also how humans fit into that picture. And it pains me that I can't tell you all that we have learned with Cassini. I can't show you all the beautiful pictures that we've taken in the last two and a half years  because I simply don't have the time. So I'm going to concentrate on two of the most exciting stories that have emerged out of this major exploratory expedition that we are conducting around Saturn  and have been for the past two and a half years. Saturn is accompanied by a very large and diverse collection of moons. They range in size from a few kilometers across to as big across as the U.S. Most of the beautiful pictures we've taken of Saturn  in fact  show Saturn in accompaniment with some of its moons. Here's Saturn with Dione  and then  here's Saturn showing the rings edge on  showing you just how vertically thin they are  with the moon Enceladus. Now  two of the    moons that Saturn has are standouts. And those are Titan and Enceladus. Titan is Saturn's largest moon  and  until Cassini had arrived there  was the largest single expanse of unexplored terrain that we had remaining in our solar system. And it is a body that has long intrigued people who've watched the planets. It has a very large  thick atmosphere  and in fact  its surface environment was believed to be more like the environment we have here on the Earth  or at least had in the past  than any other body in the solar system. Its atmosphere is largely molecular nitrogen  like you are breathing here in this room  except that its atmosphere is suffused with simple organic materials like methane and propane and ethane. And these molecules high up in the atmosphere of Titan get broken down  and their products join together to make haze particles. This haze is ubiquitous. It's completely global and enveloping Titan. And that's why you cannot see down to the surface with our eyes in the visible region of the spectrum. But these haze particles  it was surmised  before we got there with Cassini  over billions and billions of years  gently drifted down to the surface and coated the surface in a thick organic sludge. So like the equivalent  the Titan equivalent  of tar  or oil  or what    we didn't know what. But this is what we suspected. And these molecules  especially methane and ethane  can be liquids at the surface temperatures of Titan. And so it turns out that methane is to Titan what water is to the Earth. It's a condensable in the atmosphere  and so recognizing this circumstance brought to the fore a whole world of bizarre possibilities. You can have methane clouds  OK  and above those clouds  you have this hundreds of kilometers of haze  which prevent any sunlight from getting to the surface. The temperature at the surface is some     degrees below zero Fahrenheit. But despite that cold  you could have rain falling down on the surface of Titan. And doing on Titan what rain does on the Earth  it carves gullies  it forms rivers and cataracts  it can create canyons  it can pool in large basins and craters. It can wash the sludge off high mountain peaks and hills  down into the lowlands. So stop and think for a minute. Try to imagine what the surface of Titan might look like. It's dark. High noon on Titan is as dark as deep earth twilight on the Earth. It's cold  it's eerie  it's misty  it might be raining  and you might be standing on the shores of Lake Michigan brimming with paint thinner.  Laughter  That is the view that we had of the surface of Titan before we got there with Cassini  and I can tell you that what we have found on Titan  though it is not the same in detail  is every bit as fascinating as that story is. And for us  it has been like    the Cassini people    it has been like a Jules Verne adventure come true. As I said  it has a thick  extensive atmosphere. This is a picture of Titan  backlit by the Sun  with the rings as a beautiful backdrop. And yet another moon there    I don't even know which one it is. It's a very extensive atmosphere. We have instruments on Cassini which can see down to the surface through this atmosphere  and my camera system is one of them. And we have taken pictures like this. And what you see is bright and dark regions  and that's about as far as it got for us. It was so mystifying  we couldn't make out what we were seeing on Titan. When you look closer at this region  you start to see things like sinuous channels    we didn't know. You see a few round things. This  we later found out  is  in fact  a crater  but there are very few craters on the surface of Titan  meaning it's a very young surface. And there are features that look tectonic. They look like they've been pulled apart. Whenever you see anything linear on a planet  it means there's been a fracture  like a fault. And so it's been tectonically altered. But we couldn't make sense of our images  until  six months after we got into orbit  an event occurred that many have regarded as the highlight of Cassini's investigation of Titan. And that was the deployment of the Huygens probe  the European built Huygens probe that Cassini had carried for seven years across the solar system. We deployed it to the atmosphere of Titan  it took two and a half hours to descend  and it landed on the surface. And I just want to emphasize how significant an event this is. This is a device of human making  and it landed in the outer solar system for the first time in human history. It is so significant that  in my mind  this was an event that should have been celebrated with ticker tape parades in every city across the U.S. and Europe  and sadly  that wasn't the case. It was significant for another reason. This is an international mission  and this event was celebrated in Europe  in Germany  and the celebratory presentations were given in English accents  and American accents  and German accents  and French and Italian and Dutch accents. It was a moving demonstration of what the words  united nations  are supposed to mean  a true union of nations joined together in a colossal effort for good. And  in this case  it was a massive undertaking to explore a planet  and to come to understand a planetary system that  for all of human history  had been unreachable  and now humans had actually touched it. So it was    I mean  I'm getting goose bumps just talking about it. It was a tremendously emotional event  and it's something that I will personally never forget  and you shouldn't either. But anyway  the probe took measurements of the atmosphere on the way down  and it also took panoramic pictures. And I can't tell you what it was like to see the first pictures of Titan's surface from the probe. And this is what we saw. And it was a shocker  because it was everything we wanted those other pictures taken from orbit to be. It was an unambiguous pattern  a geological pattern. It's a dendritic drainage pattern that can be formed only by the flow of liquids. And you can follow these channels and you can see how they all converge. And they converge into this channel here  which drains into this region. You are looking at a shoreline. Was this a shoreline of fluids  We didn't know. But this is somewhat of a shoreline. This picture is taken at    kilometers. This is the picture taken at eight kilometers  OK  Again  the shoreline. Okay  now     kilometers  eight kilometers    this is roughly an airline altitude. If you were going to take an airplane trip across the U.S.  you would be flying at these altitudes. So  this is the picture you would have at the window of Titanian Airlines as you fly across the surface of Titan.  Laughter  And then finally  the probe came to rest on the surface  and I'm going to show you  ladies and gentlemen  the first picture ever taken from the surface of a moon in the outer solar system. And here is the horizon  OK  These are probably water ice pebbles  yes  And obviously  it landed in one of these flat  dark regions and it didn't sink out of sight. So it wasn't fluid that we landed in. What the probe came down in was basically the Titan equivalent of a mud flat. This is an unconsolidated ground that is suffused with liquid methane. And it's probably the case that this material has washed off the highlands of Titan through these channels that we saw  and has drained over billions of years to fill in low lying basins. And that is what the Huygens probe landed in. But still  there was no sign in our images  or even in the Huygens' images  of any large  open bodies of fluids. Where were they  It got even more puzzling when we found dunes. OK  so this is our movie of the equatorial region of Titan  showing these dunes. These are dunes that are     meters tall  separated by a few kilometers  and they go on for miles and miles and miles. There's hundreds  up to a       or       miles of dunes. This is the Saharan desert of Titan. It's obviously a place which is very dry  or you wouldn't get dunes. So again  it got puzzling that there were no bodies of fluid  until finally  we saw lakes in the polar regions. And there is a lake scene in the south polar region of Titan. It's about the size of Lake Ontario. And then  only a week and a half ago  we flew over the north pole of Titan and found  again  we found a feature here the size of the Caspian Sea. So it seems that the liquids  for some reason we don't understand  or during at least this season  are apparently at the poles of Titan. And I think you would agree that we have found Titan is a remarkable  mystical place. It's exotic  it's alien  but yet strangely Earth like  and having Earth like geological formations and a tremendous geographical diversity  and is a fascinating world whose only rival in the solar system for complexity and richness is the Earth itself. And so now we go onto Enceladus. Enceladus is a small moon  it's about a tenth the size of Titan. And you can see it here next to England  just to show you the size. This is not meant to be a threat. And Enceladus is very white  it's very bright  and its surface is obviously wrecked with fractures. It is a very geologically active body. But the mother lode of discoveries on Enceladus was found at the south pole    and we're looking at the south pole here    where we found this system of fractures. And they're a different color because they're a different composition. They are coated. These fractures are coated with organic materials. Moreover  this whole  entire region  the south polar region  has elevated temperatures. It's the hottest place on the planet  on the body. That's as bizarre as finding that the Antarctic on the Earth is hotter than the tropics. And then  when we took additional pictures  we discovered that from these fractures are issuing jets of fine  icy particles extending hundreds of miles into space. And when we color code this image  to bring out the faint light levels  we see that these jets feed a plume that  in fact  we see  in other images  goes thousands of miles into the space above Enceladus. My team and I have examined images like this  and like this one  and have thought about the other results from Cassini. And we have arrived at the conclusion that these jets may be erupting from pockets of liquid water under the surface of Enceladus. So we have  possibly  liquid water  organic materials and excess heat. In other words  we have possibly stumbled upon the holy grail of modern day planetary exploration  or in other words  an environment that is potentially suitable for living organisms. And I don't think I need to tell you that the discovery of life elsewhere in our solar system  whether it be on Enceladus or elsewhere  would have enormous cultural and scientific implications. Because if we could demonstrate that genesis had occurred not once  but twice  independently  in our solar system  then that means  by inference  it has occurred a staggering number of times throughout the universe and its   .  billion year history. Right now  Earth is the only planet still that we know is teeming with life. It is precious  it is unique  it is still  so far  the only home we've ever known. And if any of you were alert and coherent during the     s    and we'd forgive you  if you weren't  OK    you would remember this very famous picture taken by the Apollo   astronauts in     . It was the first time that Earth was imaged from space  and it had an enormous impact on our sense of place in the universe  and our sense of responsibility for the protection of our own planet. Well  we on Cassini have taken an equivalent first  a picture that no human eye has ever seen before. It is a total eclipse of the Sun  seen from the other side of Saturn. And in this impossibly beautiful picture  you see the main rings backlit by the Sun  you see the refracted image of the Sun and you see this ring created  in fact  by the exhalations of Enceladus. But as if that weren't brilliant enough  we can spot  in this beautiful image  sight of our own planet  cradled in the arms of Saturn's rings. Now  there is something deeply moving about seeing ourselves from afar  and capturing the sight of our little  blue ocean planet in the skies of other worlds. And that  and the perspective of ourselves that we gain from that  may be  in the end  the finest reward that we earn from this journey of discovery that started half a century ago. And thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Welcome to TED. Richard Branson  Thank you very much. The first TED has been great. CA  Have you met anyone interesting  RB  Well  the nice thing about TED is everybody's interesting. I was very glad to see Goldie Hawn  because I had an apology to make to her. I'd had dinner with her about two years ago and I'd    she had this big wedding ring and I put it on my finger and I couldn't get it off. And I went home to my wife that night and she wanted to know why I had another woman's big  massive  big wedding ring on my finger. And  anyway  the next morning we had to go along to the jeweler and get it cut off. So     Laughter     so apologies to Goldie. CA  That's pretty good. So  we're going to put up some slides of some of your companies here. You've started one or two in your time. So  you know  Virgin Atlantic  Virgin Records    I guess it all started with a magazine called Student. And then  yes  all these other ones as well. I mean  how do you do this  RB  I read all these sort of TED instructions  you must not talk about your own business  and this  and now you ask me. So I suppose you're not going to be able to kick me off the stage  since you asked the question. CA  It depends what the answer is though. RB  No  I mean  I think I learned early on that if you can run one company  you can really run any companies. I mean  companies are all about finding the right people  inspiring those people  you know  drawing out the best in people. And I just love learning and I'm incredibly inquisitive and I love taking on  you know  the status quo and trying to turn it upside down. So I've seen life as one long learning process. And if I see    you know  if I fly on somebody else's airline and find the experience is not a pleasant one  which it wasn't     years ago  then I'd think  well  you know  maybe I can create the kind of airline that I'd like to fly on. And so  you know  so got one secondhand     from Boeing and gave it a go. CA  Well  that was a bizarre thing  because you made this move that a lot of people advised you was crazy. And in fact  in a way  it almost took down your empire at one point. I had a conversation with one of the investment bankers who  at the time when you basically sold Virgin Records and invested heavily in Virgin Atlantic  and his view was that you were trading  you know  the world's fourth biggest record company for the twenty fifth biggest airline and that you were out of your mind. Why did you do that  RB  Well  I think that there's a very thin dividing line between success and failure. And I think if you start a business without financial backing  you're likely to go the wrong side of that dividing line. We had    we were being attacked by British Airways. They were trying to put our airline out of business  and they launched what's become known as the dirty tricks campaign. And I realized that the whole empire was likely to come crashing down unless I chipped in a chip. And in order to protect the jobs of the people who worked for the airline  and protect the jobs of the people who worked for the record company  I had to sell the family jewelry to protect the airline. CA  Post Napster  you're looking like a bit of a genius  actually  for that as well. RB  Yeah  as it turned out  it proved to be the right move. But  yeah  it was sad at the time  but we moved on. CA  Now  you use the Virgin brand a lot and it seems like you're getting synergy from one thing to the other. What does the brand stand for in your head  RB  Well  I like to think it stands for quality  that you know  if somebody comes across a Virgin company  they    CA  They are quality  Richard. Come on now  everyone says quality. Spirit  RB  No  but I was going to move on this. We have a lot of fun and I think the people who work for it enjoy it. As I say  we go in and shake up other industries  and I think  you know  we do it differently and I think that industries are not quite the same as a result of Virgin attacking the market. CA  I mean  there are a few launches you've done where the brand maybe hasn't worked quite as well. I mean  Virgin Brides    what happened there  RB  We couldn't find any customers. CA  I was actually also curious why    I think you missed an opportunity with your condoms launch. You called it Mates. I mean  couldn't you have used the Virgin brand for that as well  Ain't virgin no longer  or something. RB  Again  we may have had problems finding customers. I mean  we had    often  when you launch a company and you get customer complaints  you know  you can deal with them. But about three months after the launch of the condom company  I had a letter  a complaint  and I sat down and wrote a long letter back to this lady apologizing profusely. But obviously  there wasn't a lot I could do about it. And then six months later  or nine months after the problem had taken  I got this delightful letter with a picture of the baby asking if I'd be godfather  which I became. So  it all worked out well. CA  Really  You should have brought a picture. That's wonderful. RB  I should have. CA  So  just help us with some of the numbers. I mean  what are the numbers on this  I mean  how big is the group overall  How much    what's the total revenue  RB  It's about    billion dollars now  in total. CA  And how many employees  RB  About       . CA  So  you've been photographed in various ways at various times and never worrying about putting your dignity on the line or anything like that. What was that  Was that real  RB  Yeah. We were launching a megastore in Los Angeles  I think. No  I mean  I think    CA  But is that your hair  RB  No. CA  What was that one  RB  Dropping in for tea. CA  OK. RB  Ah  that was quite fun. That was a wonderful car boat in which    CA  Oh  that car that we    actually we    it was a TEDster event there  I think. Is that    could you still pause on that one actually  for a minute  RB  It's a tough job  isn't it  CA  I mean  it is a tough job. When I first came to America  I used to try this with employees as well and they kind of    they have these different rules over here  it's very strange. RB  I know  I have    the lawyers say you mustn't do things like that  but    CA  I mean  speaking of which  tell us about    RB   Pammy  we launched  you know    mistakenly thought we could take on Coca Cola  and we launched a cola bottle called  The Pammy  and it was shaped a bit like Pamela Anderson. But the trouble is  it kept on tipping over  but    CA  Designed by Philippe Starck perhaps  RB  Of course. CA  So  we'll just run a couple more pictures here. Virgin Brides. Very nice. And  OK  so stop there. This was    you had some award I think  RB  Yeah  well     years earlier  we'd launched the Sex Pistols'  God Save The Queen   and I'd certainly never expected that    years later    that she'd actually knight us. But somehow  she must have had a forgetful memory  I think. CA  Well  God saved her and you got your just reward. Do you like to be called Sir Richard  or how  RB  Nobody's ever called me Sir Richard. Occasionally in America  I hear people saying Sir Richard and think there's some Shakespearean play taking place. But nowhere else anyway. CA  OK. So can you use your knighthood for anything or is it just ... RB  No. I suppose if you're having problems getting a booking in a restaurant or something  that might be worth using it. CA  You know  it's not Richard Branson. It's Sir Richard Branson. RB  I'll go get the secretary to use it. CA  OK. So let's look at the space thing. I think  with us  we've got a video that shows what you're up to  and Virgin Galactic up in the air.  Video  So that's the Bert Rutan designed spaceship  RB  Yeah  it'll be ready in    well  ready in    months and then we do    months extensive testing. And then    months from now  people will be able to take a ride into space. CA  So this interior is Philippe Starcke designed  RB  Philippe has done the    yeah  quite a bit of it  the logos and he's building the space station in New Mexico. And basically  he's just taken an eye and the space station will be one giant eye  so when you're in space  you ought to be able to see this massive eye looking up at you. And when you land  you'll be able to go back into this giant eye. But he's an absolute genius when it comes to design. CA  But you didn't have him design the engine  RB  Philippe is quite erratic  so I think that he wouldn't be the best person to design the engine  no. CA  He gave a wonderful talk here two days ago. RB  Yeah  No  he is a    CA  Well  some people found it wonderful  some people found it completely bizarre. But  I personally found it wonderful. RB  He's a wonderful enthusiast  which is why I love him. But ... CA  So  now  you've always had this exploration bug in you. Have you ever regretted that  RB  Many times. I mean  I think with the ballooning and boating expeditions we've done in the past. Well  I got pulled out of the sea I think six times by helicopters  so    and each time  I didn't expect to come home to tell the tale. So in those moments  you certainly wonder what you're doing up there or    CA  What was the closest you got to    when did you think  this is it  I might be on my way out  RB  Well  I think the balloon adventures were    each one was  each one  actually  I think we came close. And  I mean  first of all we    nobody had actually crossed the Atlantic in a hot air balloon before  so we had to build a hot air balloon that was capable of flying in the jet stream  and we weren't quite sure  when a balloon actually got into the jet stream  whether it would actually survive the          miles an hour winds that you can find up there. And so  just the initial lift off from Sugarloaf to cross the Atlantic  as we were pushing into the jet stream  this enormous balloon    the top of the balloon ended up going at a couple of hundred miles an hour  the capsule that we were in at the bottom was going at maybe two miles an hour  and it just took off. And it was like holding onto a thousand horses. And we were just crossing every finger  praying that the balloon would hold together  which  fortunately  it did. But the ends of all those balloon trips were  you know    something seemed to go wrong every time  and on that particular occasion  the more experienced balloonist who was with me jumped  and left me holding on for dear life. CA  Did he tell you to jump  or he just said   I'm out of here   and ... RB  No  he told me jump  but once his weight had gone  the balloon just shot up to        feet and I ... CA  And you inspired an Ian McEwan novel I think with that. RB  Yeah. No  I put on my oxygen mask and stood on top of the balloon  with my parachute  looking at the swirling clouds below  trying to pluck up my courage to jump into the North Sea  which    and it was a very  very  very lonely few moments. But  anyway  we managed to survive it. CA  Did you jump  Or it came down in the end  RB  Well  I knew I had about half an hour's fuel left  and I also knew that the chances were that if I jumped  I would only have a couple of minutes of life left. So I climbed back into the capsule and just desperately tried to make sure that I was making the right decision. And wrote some notes to my family. And then climbed back up again  looked down at those clouds again  climbed back into the capsule again. And then finally  just thought  there's a better way. I've got  you know  this enormous balloon above me  it's the biggest parachute ever  why not use it  And so I managed to fly the balloon down through the clouds  and about    feet  before I hit the sea  threw myself over. And the balloon hit the sea and went shooting back up to        feet without me. But it was a wonderful feeling being in that water and    CA  What did you write to your family  RB  Just what you would do in a situation like that  just I love you very much. And I'd already written them a letter before going on this trip  which    just in case anything had happened. But fortunately  they never had to use it. CA  Your companies have had incredible PR value out of these heroics. The years    and until I stopped looking at the polls  you were sort of regarded as this great hero in the U.K. and elsewhere. And cynics might say  you know  this is just a smart business guy doing what it takes to execute his particular style of marketing. How much was the PR value part of this  RB  Well  of course  the PR experts said that as an airline owner  the last thing you should be doing is heading off in balloons and boats  and crashing into the seas. CA  They have a point  Richard. RB  In fact  I think our airline took a full page ad at the time saying  you know  come on  Richard  there are better ways of crossing the Atlantic. CA  To do all this  you must have been a genius from the get go  right  RB  Well  I won't contradict that. CA  OK  this isn't exactly hardball. OK. Didn't    weren't you just terrible at school  RB  I was dyslexic. I had no understanding of schoolwork whatsoever. I certainly would have failed IQ tests. And it was one of the reasons I left school when I was    years old. And if I    if I'm not interested in something  I don't grasp it. As somebody who's dyslexic  you also have some quite bizarre situations. I mean  for instance  I've had to    you know  I've been running the largest group of private companies in Europe  but haven't been able to know the difference between net and gross. And so the board meetings have been fascinating. And so  it's like  good news or bad news  And generally  the people would say  oh  well that's bad news. CA  But just to clarify  the    billion dollars is gross  right  That's gross  RB  Well  I hope it's net actually  having    I've got it right. CA  No  trust me  it's gross. RB  So  when I turned     somebody took me outside the boardroom and said   Look Richard  here's a    let me draw on a diagram. Here's a net in the sea  and the fish have been pulled from the sea into this net. And that's the profits you've got left over in this little net  everything else is eaten.  And I finally worked it all out. CA  But  I mean  at school    so as well as being  you know  doing pretty miserably academically  but you were also the captain of the cricket and football teams. So you were kind of a    you were a natural leader  but just a bit of a ... Were you a rebel then  or how would you ... RB  Yeah  I think I was a bit of a maverick and    but I ... And I was  yeah  I was fortunately good at sport  and so at least I had something to excel at  at school. CA  And some bizarre things happened just earlier in your life. I mean  there's the story about your mother allegedly dumping you in a field  aged four  and saying  OK  walk home.  Did this really happen  RB  She was  you know  she felt that we needed to stand on our own two feet from an early age. So she did things to us  which now she'd be arrested for  such as pushing us out of the car  and telling us to find our own way to Granny's  about five miles before we actually got there. And making us go on wonderful  long bike rides. And we were never allowed to watch television and the like. CA  But is there a risk here  I mean  there's a lot of people in the room who are wealthy  and they've got kids  and we've got this dilemma about how you bring them up. Do you look at the current generation of kids coming up and think they're too coddled  they don't know what they've got  we're going to raise a generation of privileged ... RB  No  I think if you're bringing up kids  you just want to smother them with love and praise and enthusiasm. So I don't think you can mollycoddle your kids too much really. CA  You didn't turn out too bad  I have to say  I'm ... Your headmaster said to you    I mean he found you kind of an enigma at your school    he said  you're either going to be a millionaire or go to prison  and I'm not sure which. Which of those happened first  RB  Well  I've done both. I think I went to prison first. I was actually prosecuted under two quite ancient acts in the U.K. I was prosecuted under the      Venereal Diseases Act and the      Indecent Advertisements Act. On the first occasion  for mentioning the word venereal disease in public  which    we had a center where we would help young people who had problems. And one of the problems young people have is venereal disease. And there's an ancient law that says you can't actually mention the word venereal disease or print it in public. So the police knocked on the door  and told us they were going to arrest us if we carried on mentioning the word venereal disease. We changed it to social diseases and people came along with acne and spots  but nobody came with VD any more. So  we put it back to VD and promptly got arrested. And then subsequently   Never Mind the Bollocks  Here's the Sex Pistols   the word bollocks  the police decided was a rude word and so we were arrested for using the word bollocks on the Sex Pistols' album. And John Mortimer  the playwright  defended us. And he asked if I could find a linguistics expert to come up with a different definition of the word bollocks. And so I rang up Nottingham University  and I asked to talk to the professor of linguistics. And he said   Look  bollocks is not a    has nothing to do with balls whatsoever. It's actually a nickname given to priests in the eighteenth century.  And he went   Furthermore  I'm a priest myself.  And so I said   Would you mind coming to the court   And he said he'd be delighted. And I said    and he said   Would you like me to wear my dog collar   And I said   Yes  definitely. Please.  CA  That's great. RB  So our key witness argued that it was actually  Never Mind the Priest  Here's the Sex Pistols.  And the judge found us    reluctantly found us not guilty  so ... CA  That is outrageous. So seriously  is there a dark side  A lot of people would say there's no way that someone could put together this incredible collection of businesses without knifing a few people in the back  you know  doing some ugly things. You've been accused of being ruthless. There was a nasty biography written about you by someone. Is any of it true  Is there an element of truth in it  RB  I don't actually think that the stereotype of a businessperson treading all over people to get to the top  generally speaking  works. I think if you treat people well  people will come back and come back for more. And I think all you have in life is your reputation and it's a very small world. And I actually think that the best way of becoming a successful business leader is dealing with people fairly and well  and I like to think that's how we run Virgin. CA  And what about the people who love you and who see you spending    you keep getting caught up in these new projects  but it almost feels like you're addicted to launching new stuff. You get excited by an idea and  kapow  I mean  do you think about life balance  How do your family feel about each time you step into something big and new  RB  I also believe that being a father's incredibly important  so from the time the kids were very young  you know  when they go on holiday  I go on holiday with them. And so we spend a very good sort of three months away together. Yes  I'll  you know  be in touch. We're very lucky  we have this tiny little island in the Caribbean and we can    so I can take them there and we can bring friends  and we can play together  but I can also keep in touch with what's going on. CA  You started talking in recent years about this term capitalist philanthropy. What is that  RB  Capitalism has been proven to be a system that works. You know  the alternative  communism  has not worked. But the problem with capitalism is extreme wealth ends up in the hands of a few people  and therefore extreme responsibility  I think  goes with that wealth. And I think it's important that the individuals  who are in that fortunate position  do not end up competing for bigger and bigger boats  and bigger and bigger cars  but  you know  use that money to either create new jobs or to tackle issues around the world. CA  And what are the issues that you worry about most  care most about  want to turn your resources toward  RB  Well  there's    I mean there's a lot of issues. I mean global warming certainly is a massive threat to mankind and we are putting a lot of time and energy into  A  trying to come up with alternative fuels and  B  you know  we just launched this prize  which is really a prize in case we don't get an answer on alternative fuels  in case we don't actually manage to get the carbon emissions cut down quickly  and in case we go through the tipping point. We need to try to encourage people to come up with a way of extracting carbon out of the Earth's atmosphere. And we just    you know  there weren't really people working on that before  so we wanted people to try to    all the best brains in the world to start thinking about that  and also to try to extract the methane out of the Earth's atmosphere as well. And actually  we've had about        people fill in the forms saying they want to give it a go. And so we only need one  so we're hopeful. CA  And you're also working in Africa on a couple of projects  RB  Yes  I mean  we've got    we're setting up something called the war room  which is maybe the wrong word. We're trying to    maybe we'll change it    but anyway  it's a war room to try to coordinate all the attack that's going on in Africa  all the different social problems in Africa  and try to look at best practices. So  for instance  there's a doctor in Africa that's found that if you give a mother antiretroviral drugs at    weeks  when she's pregnant  that the baby will not have HIV when it's born. And so disseminating that information to around the rest of Africa is important. CA  The war room sounds  it sounds powerful and dramatic. And is there a risk that the kind of the business heroes of the West get so excited about    I mean  they're used to having an idea  getting stuff done  and they believe profoundly in their ability to make a difference in the world. Is there a risk that we go to places like Africa and say  we've got to fix this problem and we can do it  I've got all these billions of dollars  you know  da  da  da    here's the big idea. And kind of take a much more complex situation and actually end up making a mess of it. Do you worry about that  RB  Well  first of all  on this particular situation  we're actually    we're working with the government on it. I mean  Thabo Mbeki's had his problems with accepting HIV and AIDS are related  but this is a way  I think  of him tackling this problem and instead of the world criticizing him  it's a way of working with him  with his government. It's important that if people do go to Africa and do try to help  they don't just go in there and then leave after a few years. It's got to be consistent. But I think business leaders can bring their entrepreneurial know how and help governments approach things slightly differently. For instance  we're setting up clinics in Africa where we're going to be giving free antiretroviral drugs  free TB treatment and free malaria treatment. But we're also trying to make them self sustaining clinics  so that people pay for some other aspects. CA  I mean a lot of cynics say about someone like yourself  or Bill Gates  or whatever  that this is really being    it's almost driven by some sort of desire again  you know  for the right image  for guilt avoidance and not like a real philanthropic instinct. What would you say to them  RB  Well  I think that everybody    people do things for a whole variety of different reasons and I think that  you know  when I'm on me deathbed  I will want to feel that I've made a difference to other people's lives. And that may be a selfish thing to think  but it's the way I've been brought up. I think if I'm in a position to radically change other people's lives for the better  I should do so. CA  How old are you  RB  I'm   . CA  I mean  the psychologist Erik Erikson says that    as I understand him and I'm a total amateur    but that during   s    s people are driven by this desire to grow and that's where they get their fulfillment.   s    s  the mode of operation shifts more to the quest for wisdom and a search for legacy. I mean  it seems like you're still a little bit in the growth phases  you're still doing these incredible new plans. How much do you think about legacy  and what would you like your legacy to be  RB  I don't think I think too much about legacy. I mean  I like to    you know  my grandmother lived to      so hopefully I've got another    or    years to go. No  I just want to live life to its full. You know  if I can make a difference  I hope to be able to make a difference. And I think one of the positive things at the moment is you've got Sergey and Larry from Google  for instance  who are good friends. And  thank God  you've got two people who genuinely care about the world and with that kind of wealth. If they had that kind of wealth and they didn't care about the world  it would be very worrying. And you know they're going to make a hell of a difference to the world. And I think it's important that people in that kind of position do make a difference. CA  Well  Richard  when I was starting off in business  I knew nothing about it and I also was sort of    I thought that business people were supposed to just be ruthless and that that was the only way you could have a chance of succeeding. And you actually did inspire me. I looked at you  I thought  well  he's made it. Maybe there is a different way. So I would like to thank you for that inspiration  and for coming to TED today. Thank you. Thank you so much. So  where are the robots  We've been told for    years already that they're coming soon. Very soon they'll be doing everything for us. They'll be cooking  cleaning  buying things  shopping  building. But they aren't here. Meanwhile  we have illegal immigrants doing all the work  but we don't have any robots. So what can we do about that  What can we say  So I want to give a little bit of a different perspective of how we can perhaps look at these things in a little bit of a different way. And this is an x ray picture of a real beetle  and a Swiss watch  back from '  . You look at that    what was true then is certainly true today. We can still make the pieces. We can make the right pieces. We can make the circuitry of the right computational power  but we can't actually put them together to make something that will actually work and be as adaptive as these systems. So let's try to look at it from a different perspective. Let's summon the best designer  the mother of all designers. Let's see what evolution can do for us. So we threw in    we created a primordial soup with lots of pieces of robots    with bars  with motors  with neurons. Put them all together  and put all this under kind of natural selection  under mutation  and rewarded things for how well they can move forward. A very simple task  and it's interesting to see what kind of things came out of that. So if you look  you can see a lot of different machines come out of this. They all move around. They all crawl in different ways  and you can see on the right  that we actually made a couple of these things  and they work in reality. These are not very fantastic robots  but they evolved to do exactly what we reward them for  for moving forward. So that was all done in simulation  but we can also do that on a real machine. Here's a physical robot that we actually have a population of brains  competing  or evolving on the machine. It's like a rodeo show. They all get a ride on the machine  and they get rewarded for how fast or how far they can make the machine move forward. And you can see these robots are not ready to take over the world yet  but they gradually learn how to move forward  and they do this autonomously. So in these two examples  we had basically machines that learned how to walk in simulation  and also machines that learned how to walk in reality. But I want to show you a different approach  and this is this robot over here  which has four legs. It has eight motors  four on the knees and four on the hip. It has also two tilt sensors that tell the machine which way it's tilting. But this machine doesn't know what it looks like. You look at it and you see it has four legs  the machine doesn't know if it's a snake  if it's a tree  it doesn't have any idea what it looks like  but it's going to try to find that out. Initially  it does some random motion  and then it tries to figure out what it might look like. And you're seeing a lot of things passing through its minds  a lot of self models that try to explain the relationship between actuation and sensing. It then tries to do a second action that creates the most disagreement among predictions of these alternative models  like a scientist in a lab. Then it does that and tries to explain that  and prune out its self models. This is the last cycle  and you can see it's pretty much figured out what its self looks like. And once it has a self model  it can use that to derive a pattern of locomotion. So what you're seeing here are a couple of machines    a pattern of locomotion. We were hoping that it wass going to have a kind of evil  spidery walk  but instead it created this pretty lame way of moving forward. But when you look at that  you have to remember that this machine did not do any physical trials on how to move forward  nor did it have a model of itself. It kind of figured out what it looks like  and how to move forward  and then actually tried that out. So  we'll move forward to a different idea. So that was what happened when we had a couple of    that's what happened when you had a couple of    OK  OK  OK       they don't like each other. So there's a different robot. That's what happened when the robots actually are rewarded for doing something. What happens if you don't reward them for anything  you just throw them in  So we have these cubes  like the diagram showed here. The cube can swivel  or flip on its side  and we just throw       of these cubes into a soup    this is in simulation   and don't reward them for anything  we just let them flip. We pump energy into this and see what happens in a couple of mutations. So  initially nothing happens  they're just flipping around there. But after a very short while  you can see these blue things on the right there begin to take over. They begin to self replicate. So in absence of any reward  the intrinsic reward is self replication. And we've actually built a couple of these  and this is part of a larger robot made out of these cubes. It's an accelerated view  where you can see the robot actually carrying out some of its replication process. So you're feeding it with more material    cubes in this case    and more energy  and it can make another robot. So of course  this is a very crude machine  but we're working on a micro scale version of these  and hopefully the cubes will be like a powder that you pour in. OK  so what can we learn  These robots are of course not very useful in themselves  but they might teach us something about how we can build better robots  and perhaps how humans  animals  create self models and learn. And one of the things that I think is important is that we have to get away from this idea of designing the machines manually  but actually let them evolve and learn  like children  and perhaps that's the way we'll get there. Thank you. What I am always thinking about is what this session is about  which is called simplicity. And almost  I would almost call it being simple minded  but in the best sense of the word. I'm trying to figure out two very simple things  how to live and how to die  period. That's all I'm trying to do  all day long. And I'm also trying to have some meals  and have some snacks  and  you know  and yell at my children  and do all the normal things that keep you grounded. So  I was fortunate enough to be born a very dreamy child. My older sister was busy torturing my parents  and they were busy torturing her. I was lucky enough to be completely ignored  which is a fabulous thing  actually  I want to tell you. So  I was able to completely daydream my way through my life. And I finally daydreamed my way into NYU  at a very good time  in       where I met a man who was trying to blow up the math building of NYU. And I was writing terrible poetry and knitting sweaters for him. And feminists hated us  and the whole thing was wretched from beginning to end. But I kept writing bad poetry  and he didn't blow up the math building  but he went to Cuba. But I gave him the money  because I was from Riverdale so I had more money than he did. And that was a good thing to help  you know  the cause. But  then he came back  and things happened  and I decided I really hated my writing  that it was awful  awful  purple prose. And I decided that I wanted to tell    but I still wanted to tell a narrative story and I still wanted to tell my stories. So I decided that I would start to draw. How hard could that be  And so what happened was that I started just becoming an editorial illustrator through  you know  sheer whatever  sheer ignorance. And we started a studio. Well  Tibor really started the studio  called M Co. And the premise of M Co was  we don't know anything  but that's all right  we're going to do it anyway. And as a matter of fact  it's better not to know anything  because if you know too much  you're stymied. So  the premise in the studio was  there are no boundaries  there is no fear. And I    and my full time job  I landed the best job on Earth  was to daydream  and to actually come up with absurd ideas that    fortunately  there were enough people there  and it was a team  it was a collective  it was not just me coming up with crazy ideas. But the point was that I was there as myself  as a dreamer. And so some of the things    I mean  it was a long history of M Co  and clearly we also needed to make some money  so we decided we would create a series of products. And some of the watches there  attempting to be beautiful and humorous    maybe not attempting  hopefully succeeding. That to be able to talk about content  to break apart what you normally expect  to use humor and surprise  elegance and humanity in your work was really important to us. It was a very high  it was a very impersonal time in design and we wanted to say  the content is what's important  not the package  not the wrapping. You really have to be journalists  you have to be inventors  you have to use your imagination more importantly than anything. So  the good news is that I have a dog and  though I don't know if I believe in luck    I don't know what I believe in  it's a very complicated question  but I do know that before I go away  I crank his tail seven times. So  whenever he sees a suitcase in the house  because everybody's always  you know  leaving  they're always cranking this wonderful dog's tail  and he runs to the other room. But I am able to make the transition from working for children and    from working for adults to children  and back and forth  because  you know  I can say that I'm immature  and in a way  that's true. I don't really    I mean  I could tell you that I didn't understand  I'm not proud of it  but I didn't understand let's say    percent of the talks at this conference. But I have been taking beautiful notes of drawings and I have a gorgeous onion from Murray Gell Mann's talk. And I have a beautiful page of doodles from Jonathan Woodham's talk. So  good things come out of  you know  incomprehension       which I will do a painting of  and then it will end up in my work. So  I'm open to the possibilities of not knowing and finding out something new. So  in writing for children  it seems simple  and it is. You have to condense a story into    pages  usually. And what you have to do is  you really have to edit down to what you want to say. And hopefully  you're not talking down to kids and you're not talking in such a way that you  you know  couldn't stand reading it after one time. So  I hopefully am writing  you know  books that are good for children and for adults. But the painting reflects    I don't think differently for children than I do for adults. I try to use the same kind of imagination  the same kind of whimsy  the same kind of love of language. So  you know  and I have lots of wonderful looking friends. This is Andrew Gatz  and he walked in through the door and I said   You  Sit down there.  You know  I take lots of photos. And the Bertoia chair in the background is my favorite chair. So  I get to put in all of the things that I love. Hopefully  a dialog between adults and children will happen on many different levels  and hopefully different kinds of humor will evolve. And the books are really journals of my life. I never    I don't like plots. I don't know what a plot means. I can't stand the idea of anything that starts in the beginning  you know  beginning  middle and end. It really scares me  because my life is too random and too confused  and I enjoy it that way. But anyway  so we were in Venice  and this is our room. And I had this dream that I was wearing this fantastic green gown  and I was looking out the window  and it was really a beautiful thing. And so  I was able to put that into this story  which is an alphabet  and hopefully go on to something else. The letter C had other things in it. I was fortunate also  to meet the man who's sitting on the bed  though I gave him hair over here and he doesn't have hair. Well  he has some hair but    well  he used to have hair. And with him  I was able to do a project that was really fantastic. I work for the New Yorker  and I do covers  and      happened and it was  you know  a complete and utter end of the world as we knew it. And Rick and I were on our way to a party in the Bronx  and somebody said Bronxistan  and somebody said Ferreristan  and we came up with this New Yorker cover  which we were able to    we didn't know what we were doing. We weren't trying to be funny  we weren't trying to be    well  we were trying to be funny actually  that's not true. We hoped we'd be funny  but we didn't know it would be a cover  and we didn't know that that image  at the moment that it happened  would be something that would be so wonderful for a lot of people. And it really became the    I don't know  you know  it was one of those moments people started laughing at what was going on. And from  you know  Fattushis  to Taxistan to  you know  for the Fashtoonks  Botoxia  Pashmina  Khlintunisia  you know  we were able to take the city and make fun of this completely foreign  who are    what's going on over here  Who are these people  What are these tribes  And David Remnick  who was really wonderful about it  had one problem. He didn't like Al Zheimers  because he thought it would insult people with Alzheimer's. But you know  we said   David  who's going to know  They're not.  So it stayed in  and it was  and  you know  it was a good thing. You know  in the course of my life  I never know what's going to happen and that's kind of the beauty part. And we were on Cape Cod  a place  obviously  of great inspiration  and I picked up this book   The Elements of Style   at a yard sale. And I didn't    and I'd never used it in school  because I was too busy writing poems  and flunking out  and I don't know what  sitting in cafes. But I picked it up and I started reading it and I thought  this book is amazing. I said  people should know about this book. So I decided it needed a few    it needed a lift  it needed a few illustrations. And basically  I called the  you know  I convinced the White Estate  and what an intersection of like  you know  Polish Jew  you know  main WASP family. Here I am  saying  I'd like to do something to this book. And they said yes  and they left me completely alone  which was a gorgeous  wonderful thing. And I took the examples that they gave  and just did    paintings  basically. So  this is  I don't know if you can read this.  Well  Susan  this is a fine mess you are in.  And when you're dealing with grammar  which is  you know  incredibly dry  E.B. White wrote such wonderful  whimsical    and actually  Strunk    and then you come to the rules and  you know  there are lots of grammar things.  Do you mind me asking a question  Do you mind my asking a question    Would  could  should  or would  should  could.  And  would  is Coco Chanel's lover   should  is Edith Sitwell  and  could  is an August Sander subject. And   He noticed a large stain in the center of the rug.  So  there's a kind of British understatement  murder mystery theme that I really love very much. And then   Be obscure clearly  Be wild of tongue in a way we can understand.  E.B. White wrote us a number of rules  which can either paralyze you and make you loathe him for the rest of time  or you can ignore them  which I do  or you can  I don't know what  you know  eat a sandwich. So  what I did when I was painting was I started singing  because I really adore singing  and I think that music is the highest form of all art. So  I commissioned a wonderful composer  Nico Muhly  who wrote nine songs using the text  and we performed this fantastic evening of    he wrote music for both amateurs and professionals. I played the clattering teacup and the slinky in the main reading room of the New York Public Library  where you're supposed to be very  very quiet  and it was a phenomenally wonderful event  which we hopefully will do some more. Who knows  The New York TimesSelect  the op ed page  asked me to do a column  and they said  you can do whatever you want. So  once a month for the last year  I've been doing a column called  The Principles of Uncertainty   which  you know  I don't know who Heisenberg is  but I know I can throw that around now. You know  it's the principles of uncertainty  so  you know. I'm going to read quickly    and probably I'm going to edit some  because I don't have that much time left    a few of the columns. And basically  I was so  you know  it was so amusing  because I said   Well  how much space do I have   And they said   Well  you know  it's the Internet.  And I said   Yes  but how much space do I have   And they said   It's unlimited  it's unlimited.  OK. So  the first one I was very timid  and I'll begin.  How can I tell you everything that is in my heart  Impossible to begin. Enough. No. Begin with the hapless dodo.  And I talk about the dodo  and how the dodo became extinct  and then I talk about Spinoza.  As the last dodo was dying  Spinoza was looking for a rational explanation for everything  called eudaemonia. And then he breathed his last  with loved ones around him  and I know that he had chicken soup also  as his last meal.  I happen to know it for a fact. And then he died  and there was no more Spinoza. Extinct. And then  we don't have a stuffed Spinoza  but we do have a stuffed Pavlov's dog  and I visited him in the Museum of Hygiene in St. Petersburg  in Russia. And there he is  with this horrible electrical box on his rump in this fantastic  decrepit palace.  And I think it must have been a very  very dark day when the Bolsheviks arrived. Maybe amongst themselves they had a few good laughs  but Stalin was a paranoid man  even more than my father.  You don't even know.  And decided his top people had to be extinctified.  Which I think I made up  which is a good thing. And so  this is a chart of  you know  just a small chart  because the chart would go on forever of all the people that he killed. So  shot dead  smacked over the head  you know  thrown away.  Nabokov's family fled Russia. How could the young Nabokov  sitting innocently and elegantly in a red chair  leafing through a book and butterflies  imagine such displacement  such loss   And then I want to tell you that this is a map. So   My beautiful mother's family fled Russia as well. Too many pogroms. Leaving the shack  the wild blueberry woods  the geese  the River Sluch  they went to Palestine and then America.  And my mother drew this map for me of the United States of America  and that is my DNA over here  because that person who I grew up with had no use for facts whatsoever. Facts were actually banished from our home. And so  if you see that Texas    you know  Texas and California are under Canada  and that South Carolina is on top of North Carolina  this is the home that I grew up in  OK  So  it's a miracle that I'm here today. But actually  it's not. It's actually a wonderful thing. But then she says Tel Aviv and Lenin  which is the town they came from  and   Sorry  the rest unknown  thank you.  But in her lexicon   sorry  the rest unknown  thank you  is  sorry  the rest unknown  go to hell   because she couldn't care less.  The Impossibility of February  is that February's a really wretched month in New York and the images for me conjure up these really awful things. Well  not so awful. I received a box in the mail and it was wrapped with newspaper and there was the picture of the man on the newspaper and he was dead. And I say   I hope he's not really dead  just enjoying a refreshing lie down in the snow  but the caption says he is dead.  And actually  he was. I think he's dead  though I don't know  maybe he's not dead.  And this woman leans over in anguish  not about that man  but about all sad things. It happens quite often in February.  There's consoling. This man is angry because somebody threw onions all over the staircase  and basically    you know  I guess onions are a theme here. And he says   It is impossible not to lie. It is February and not lying is impossible.  And I really spend a lot of time wondering  how much truth do we tell  What is it that we're actually    what story are we actually telling  How do we know when we are ourselves  How do we actually know that these sentences coming out of our mouths are real stories  you know  are real sentences  Or are they fake sentences that we think we ought to be saying  I'm going to quickly go through this. A quote by Bertrand Russell   All the labor of all the ages  all the devotion  all the inspiration  all the noonday brightness of human genius are destined to extinction. So now  my friends  if that is true  and it is true  what is the point   A complicated question. And so  you know  I talk to my friends and I go to plays where they're singing Russian songs. Oh my God  you know what  Could we have    no  we don't have time. I taped my aunt. I taped my aunt singing a song in Russian from the    you know  could we have it for a second  Do you have that  OK. I taped my    my aunt used to swim in the ocean every day of the year until she was about   . So    and that's a song about how everybody's miserable because  you know  we're from Russia. I went to visit Kitty Carlisle Hart  and she is     and when I brought her a copy of  The Elements of Style   she said she would treasure it. And then I said    oh  and she was talking about Moss Hart  and I said   When you met him  you knew it was him.  And she said   I knew it was he.  So  I was the one who should have kept the book  but it was a really wonderful moment. And she dated George Gershwin  so  you know  get out. Gershwin died at the age of   . He's buried in the same cemetery as my husband. I don't want to talk about that now. I do want to talk    the absolute icing on this cemetery cake is the Barricini family mausoleum nearby. I think the Barricini family should open a store there and sell chocolate. And I would like to run it for them. And I went to visit Louise Bourgeoise  who's also still working  and I looked at her sink  which is really amazing  and left. And then I photograph and do a painting of a sofa on the street. And a woman who lives on our street  Lolita. And then I go and have some tea. And then my Aunt Frances dies  and before she died  she tried to pay with Sweet'N Low packets for her bagel. And I wonder what the point is and then I know  and I see that Hy Meyerowitz  Rick Meyerowitz's father  a dry cleaning supply salesman from the Bronx  won the Charlie Chaplin look alike contest in     . That's actually Hy. And I look at a beautiful bowl of fruit  and I look at a dress that I sewed for friends of mine. And it says   Ich habe genug   which is a Bach cantata  which I once thought meant  I've had it  I can't take it anymore  give me a break   but I was wrong. It means  I have enough.  And that is utterly true. I happen to be alive  end of discussion. Thank you. I live and work from Tokyo  Japan. And I specialize in human behavioral research  and applying what we learn to think about the future in different ways  and to design for that future. And you know  to be honest  I've been doing this for seven years  and I haven't got a clue what the future is going to be like. But I've got a pretty good idea how people will behave when they get there. This is my office. It's out there. It's not in the lab  and it's increasingly in places like India  China  Brazil  Africa. We live on a planet     .  billion people. About three billion people  by the end of this year  will have cellular connectivity. And it'll take about another two years to connect the next billion after that. And I mention this because  if we want to design for that future  we need to figure out what those people are about. And that's  kind of  where I see what my job is and what our team's job is. Our research often starts with a very simple question. So I'll give you an example. What do you carry  If you think of everything in your life that you own  when you walk out that door  what do you consider to take with you  When you're looking around  what do you consider  Of that stuff  what do you carry  And of that stuff  what do you actually use  So this is interesting to us  because the conscious and subconscious decision process implies that the stuff that you do take with you and end up using has some kind of spiritual  emotional or functional value. And to put it really bluntly  you know  people are willing to pay for stuff that has value  right  So I've probably done about five years' research looking at what people carry. I go in people's bags. I look in people's pockets  purses. I go in their homes. And we do this worldwide  and we follow them around town with video cameras. It's kind of like stalking with permission. And we do all this    and to go back to the original question  what do people carry  And it turns out that people carry a lot of stuff. OK  that's fair enough. But if you ask people what the three most important things that they carry are    across cultures and across gender and across contexts    most people will say keys  money and  if they own one  a mobile phone. And I'm not saying this is a good thing  but this is a thing  right  I mean  I couldn't take your phones off you if I wanted to. You'd probably kick me out  or something. OK  it might seem like an obvious thing for someone who works for a mobile phone company to ask. But really  the question is  why  Right  So why are these things so important in our lives  And it turns out  from our research  that it boils down to survival    survival for us and survival for our loved ones. So  keys provide an access to shelter and warmth    transport as well  in the U.S. increasingly. Money is useful for buying food  sustenance  among all its other uses. And a mobile phone  it turns out  is a great recovery tool. If you prefer this kind of Maslow's hierarchy of needs  those three objects are very good at supporting the lowest rungs in Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Yes  they do a whole bunch of other stuff  but they're very good at this. And in particular  it's the mobile phone's ability to allow people to transcend space and time. And what I mean by that is  you know  you can transcend space by simply making a voice call  right  And you can transcend time by sending a message at your convenience  and someone else can pick it up at their convenience. And this is fairly universally appreciated  it turns out  which is why we have three billion plus people who have been connected. And they value that connectivity. But actually  you can do this kind of stuff with PCs. And you can do them with phone kiosks. And the mobile phone  in addition  is both personal    and so it also gives you a degree of privacy    and it's convenient. You don't need to ask permission from anyone  you can just go ahead and do it  right  However  for these things to help us survive  it depends on them being carried. But    and it's a pretty big but    we forget. We're human  that's what we do. It's one of our features. I think  quite a nice feature. So we forget  but we're also adaptable  and we adapt to situations around us pretty well. And so we have these strategies to remember  and one of them was mentioned yesterday. And it's  quite simply  the point of reflection. And that's that moment when you're walking out of a space  and you turn around  and quite often you tap your pockets. Even women who keep stuff in their bags tap their pockets. And you turn around  and you look back into the space  and some people talk aloud. And pretty much everyone does it at some point. OK  the next thing is    most of you  if you have a stable home life  and what I mean is that you don't travel all the time  and always in hotels  but most people have what we call a center of gravity. And a center of gravity is where you keep these objects. And these things don't stay in the center of gravity  but over time  they gravitate there. It's where you expect to find stuff. And in fact  when you're turning around  and you're looking inside the house  and you're looking for this stuff  this is where you look first  right  OK  so when we did this research  we found the absolutely      percent  guaranteed way to never forget anything ever  ever again. And that is  quite simply  to have nothing to remember. OK  now  that sounds like something you get on a Chinese fortune cookie  right  But is  in fact  about the art of delegation. And from a design perspective  it's about understanding what you can delegate to technology and what you can delegate to other people. And it turns out  delegation    if you want it to be    can be the solution for pretty much everything  apart from things like bodily functions  going to the toilet. You can't ask someone to do that on your behalf. And apart from things like entertainment  you wouldn't pay for someone to go to the cinema for you and have fun on your behalf  or  at least  not yet. Maybe sometime in the future  we will. So  let me give you an example of delegation in practice  right. So this is    probably the thing I'm most passionate about is the research that we've been doing on illiteracy and how people who are illiterate communicate. So  the U.N. estimated    this is      figures    that there are almost     million people who can't read and write  worldwide. So  we've been conducting a lot of research. And one of the things we were looking at is    if you can't read and write  if you want to communicate over distances  you need to be able to identify the person that you want to communicate with. It could be a phone number  it could be an e mail address  it could be a postal address. Simple question  if you can't read and write  how do you manage your contact information  And the fact is that millions of people do it. Just from a design perspective  we didn't really understand how they did it  and so that's just one small example of the kind of research that we were doing. And it turns out that illiterate people are masters of delegation. So they delegate that part of the task process to other people  the stuff that they can't do themselves. Let me give you another example of delegation. This one's a little bit more sophisticated  and this is from a study that we did in Uganda about how people who are sharing devices  use those devices. Sente is a word in Uganda that means money. It has a second meaning  which is to send money as airtime. OK  And it works like this. So let's say  June  you're in a village  rural village. I'm in Kampala and I'm the wage earner. I'm sending money back  and it works like this. So  in your village  there's one person in the village with a phone  and that's the phone kiosk operator. And it's quite likely that they'd have a quite simple mobile phone as a phone kiosk. So what I do is  I buy a prepaid card like this. And instead of using that money to top up my own phone  I call up the local village operator. And I read out that number to them  and they use it to top up their phone. So  they're topping up the value from Kampala  and it's now being topped up in the village. You take a    or    percent commission  and then you    the kiosk operator takes    or    percent commission  and passes the rest over to you in cash. OK  there's two things I like about this. So the first is  it turns anyone who has access to a mobile phone    anyone who has a mobile phone    essentially into an ATM machine. It brings rudimentary banking services to places where there's no banking infrastructure. And even if they could have access to the banking infrastructure  they wouldn't necessarily be considered viable customers  because they're not wealthy enough to have bank accounts. There's a second thing I like about this. And that is that despite all the resources at my disposal  and despite all our kind of apparent sophistication  I know I could never have designed something as elegant and as totally in tune with the local conditions as this. OK  And  yes  there are things like Grameen Bank and micro lending. But the difference between this and that is  there's no central authority trying to control this. This is just street up innovation. So  it turns out the street is a never ending source of inspiration for us. And OK  if you break one of these things here  you return it to the carrier. They'll give you a new one. They'll probably give you three new ones  right  I mean  that's buy three  get one free. That kind of thing. If you go on the streets of India and China  you see this kind of stuff. And this is where they take the stuff that breaks  and they fix it  and they put it back into circulation. This is from a workbench in Jilin City  in China  and you can see people taking down a phone and putting it back together. They reverse engineer manuals. This is a kind of hacker's manual  and it's written in Chinese and English. They also write them in Hindi. You can subscribe to these. There are training institutes where they're churning out people for fixing these things as well. But what I like about this is  it boils down to someone on the street with a small  flat surface  a screwdriver  a toothbrush for cleaning the contact heads    because they often get dust on the contact heads    and knowledge. And it's all about the social network of the knowledge  floating around. And I like this because it challenges the way that we design stuff  and build stuff  and potentially distribute stuff. It challenges the norms. OK  for me the street just raises so many different questions. Like  this is Viagra that I bought from a backstreet sex shop in China. And China is a country where you get a lot of fakes. And I know what you're asking    did I test it  I'm not going to answer that  OK. But I look at something like this  and I consider the implications of trust and confidence in the purchase process. And we look at this and we think  well  how does that apply  for example  for the design of    the lessons from this    apply to the design of online services  future services in these markets  This is a pair of underpants from    from Tibet. And I look at something like this  and honestly  you know  why would someone design underpants with a pocket  right  And I look at something like this and it makes me question  if we were to take all the functionality in things like this  and redistribute them around the body in some kind of personal area network  how would we prioritize where to put stuff  And yes  this is quite trivial  but actually the lessons from this can apply to that kind of personal area networks. And what you see here is a couple of phone numbers written above the shack in rural Uganda. This doesn't have house numbers. This has phone numbers. So what does it mean when people's identity is mobile  When those extra three billion people's identity is mobile  it isn't fixed  Your notion of identity is out of date already  OK  for those extra three billion people. This is how it's shifting. And then I go to this picture here  which is the one that I started with. And this is from Delhi. It's from a study we did into illiteracy  and it's a guy in a teashop. You can see the chai being poured in the background. And he's a  you know  incredibly poor teashop worker  on the lowest rungs in the society. And he  somehow  has the appreciation of the values of Livestrong. And it's not necessarily the same values  but some kind of values of Livestrong  to actually go out and purchase them  and actually display them. For me  this kind of personifies this connected world  where everything is intertwined  and the dots are    it's all about the dots joining together. OK  the title of this presentation is  Connections and Consequences   and it's really a kind of summary of five years of trying to figure out what it's going to be like when everyone on the planet has the ability to transcend space and time in a personal and convenient manner  right  When everyone's connected. And there are four things. So  the first thing is the immediacy of ideas  the speed at which ideas go around. And I know TED is about big ideas  but actually  the benchmark for a big idea is changing. If you want a big idea  you need to embrace everyone on the planet  that's the first thing. The second thing is the immediacy of objects. And what I mean by that is  as these become smaller  as the functionality that you can access through this becomes greater    things like banking  identity    these things quite simply move very quickly around the world. And so the speed of the adoption of things is just going to become that much more rapid  in a way that we just totally cannot conceive  when you get it to  .  billion and the growth in the world's population. The next thing is that  however we design this stuff    carefully design this stuff    the street will take it  and will figure out ways to innovate  as long as it meets base needs    the ability to transcend space and time  for example. And it will innovate in ways that we cannot anticipate. In ways that  despite our resources  they can do it better than us. That's my feeling. And if we're smart  we'll look at this stuff that's going on  and we'll figure out a way to enable it to inform and infuse both what we design and how we design. And the last thing is that    actually  the direction of the conversation. With another three billion people connected  they want to be part of the conversation. And I think our relevance and TED's relevance is really about embracing that and learning how to listen  essentially. And we need to learn how to listen. So thank you very  very much. Well  as Chris pointed out  I study the human brain  the functions and structure of the human brain. And I just want you to think for a minute about what this entails. Here is this mass of jelly  three pound mass of jelly you can hold in the palm of your hand  and it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space. It can contemplate the meaning of infinity and it can contemplate itself contemplating on the meaning of infinity. And this peculiar recursive quality that we call self awareness  which I think is the holy grail of neuroscience  of neurology  and hopefully  someday  we'll understand how that happens. OK  so how do you study this mysterious organ  I mean  you have     billion nerve cells  little wisps of protoplasm  interacting with each other  and from this activity emerges the whole spectrum of abilities that we call human nature and human consciousness. How does this happen  Well  there are many ways of approaching the functions of the human brain. One approach  the one we use mainly  is to look at patients with sustained damage to a small region of the brain  where there's been a genetic change in a small region of the brain. What then happens is not an across the board reduction in all your mental capacities  a sort of blunting of your cognitive ability. What you get is a highly selective loss of one function  with other functions being preserved intact  and this gives you some confidence in asserting that that part of the brain is somehow involved in mediating that function. So you can then map function onto structure  and then find out what the circuitry's doing to generate that particular function. So that's what we're trying to do. So let me give you a few striking examples of this. In fact  I'm giving you three examples  six minutes each  during this talk. The first example is an extraordinary syndrome called Capgras syndrome. If you look at the first slide there  that's the temporal lobes  frontal lobes  parietal lobes  OK    the lobes that constitute the brain. And if you look  tucked away inside the inner surface of the temporal lobes    you can't see it there    is a little structure called the fusiform gyrus. And that's been called the face area in the brain  because when it's damaged  you can no longer recognize people's faces. You can still recognize them from their voice and say   Oh yeah  that's Joe   but you can't look at their face and know who it is  right  You can't even recognize yourself in the mirror. I mean  you know it's you because you wink and it winks  and you know it's a mirror  but you don't really recognize yourself as yourself. OK. Now that syndrome is well known as caused by damage to the fusiform gyrus. But there's another rare syndrome  so rare  in fact  that very few physicians have heard about it  not even neurologists. This is called the Capgras delusion  and that is a patient  who's otherwise completely normal  has had a head injury  comes out of coma  otherwise completely normal  he looks at his mother and says   This looks exactly like my mother  this woman  but she's an impostor. She's some other woman pretending to be my mother.  Now  why does this happen  Why would somebody    and this person is perfectly lucid and intelligent in all other respects  but when he sees his mother  his delusion kicks in and says  it's not mother. Now  the most common interpretation of this  which you find in all the psychiatry textbooks  is a Freudian view  and that is that this chap    and the same argument applies to women  by the way  but I'll just talk about guys. When you're a little baby  a young baby  you had a strong sexual attraction to your mother. This is the so called Oedipus complex of Freud. I'm not saying I believe this  but this is the standard Freudian view. And then  as you grow up  the cortex develops  and inhibits these latent sexual urges towards your mother. Thank God  or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother. And then what happens is  there's a blow to your head  damaging the cortex  allowing these latent sexual urges to emerge  flaming to the surface  and suddenly and inexplicably you find yourself being sexually aroused by your mother. And you say   My God  if this is my mom  how come I'm being sexually turned on  She's some other woman. She's an impostor.  It's the only interpretation that makes sense to your damaged brain. This has never made much sense to me  this argument. It's very ingenious  as all Freudian arguments are       but didn't make much sense because I have seen the same delusion  a patient having the same delusion  about his pet poodle. He'll say   Doctor  this is not Fifi. It looks exactly like Fifi  but it's some other dog.  Right  Now  you try using the Freudian explanation there. You'll start talking about the latent bestiality in all humans  or some such thing  which is quite absurd  of course. Now  what's really going on  So  to explain this curious disorder  we look at the structure and functions of the normal visual pathways in the brain. Normally  visual signals come in  into the eyeballs  go to the visual areas in the brain. There are  in fact     areas in the back of your brain concerned with just vision  and after processing all that  the message goes to a small structure called the fusiform gyrus  where you perceive faces. There are neurons there that are sensitive to faces. You can call it the face area of the brain  right  I talked about that earlier. Now  when that area's damaged  you lose the ability to see faces  right  But from that area  the message cascades into a structure called the amygdala in the limbic system  the emotional core of the brain  and that structure  called the amygdala  gauges the emotional significance of what you're looking at. Is it prey  Is it predator  Is it mate  Or is it something absolutely trivial  like a piece of lint  or a piece of chalk  or a    I don't want to point to that  but    or a shoe  or something like that  OK  Which you can completely ignore. So if the amygdala is excited  and this is something important  the messages then cascade into the autonomic nervous system. Your heart starts beating faster. You start sweating to dissipate the heat that you're going to create from muscular exertion. And that's fortunate  because we can put two electrodes on your palm and measure the change in skin resistance produced by sweating. So I can determine  when you're looking at something  whether you're excited or whether you're aroused  or not  OK  And I'll get to that in a minute. So my idea was  when this chap looks at an object  when he looks at his    any object for that matter  it goes to the visual areas and  however  and it's processed in the fusiform gyrus  and you recognize it as a pea plant  or a table  or your mother  for that matter  OK  And then the message cascades into the amygdala  and then goes down the autonomic nervous system. But maybe  in this chap  that wire that goes from the amygdala to the limbic system  the emotional core of the brain  is cut by the accident. So because the fusiform is intact  the chap can still recognize his mother  and says   Oh yeah  this looks like my mother.  But because the wire is cut to the emotional centers  he says   But how come  if it's my mother  I don't experience a warmth   Or terror  as the case may be  Right  And therefore  he says   How do I account for this inexplicable lack of emotions  This can't be my mother. It's some strange woman pretending to be my mother.  How do you test this  Well  what you do is  if you take any one of you here  and put you in front of a screen  and measure your galvanic skin response  and show pictures on the screen  I can measure how you sweat when you see an object  like a table or an umbrella. Of course  you don't sweat. If I show you a picture of a lion  or a tiger  or a pinup  you start sweating  right  And  believe it or not  if I show you a picture of your mother    I'm talking about normal people    you start sweating. You don't even have to be Jewish. Now  what happens if you show this patient  You take the patient and show him pictures on the screen and measure his galvanic skin response. Tables and chairs and lint  nothing happens  as in normal people  but when you show him a picture of his mother  the galvanic skin response is flat. There's no emotional reaction to his mother  because that wire going from the visual areas to the emotional centers is cut. So his vision is normal because the visual areas are normal  his emotions are normal    he'll laugh  he'll cry  so on and so forth    but the wire from vision to emotions is cut and therefore he has this delusion that his mother is an impostor. It's a lovely example of the sort of thing we do  take a bizarre  seemingly incomprehensible  neural psychiatric syndrome and say that the standard Freudian view is wrong  that  in fact  you can come up with a precise explanation in terms of the known neural anatomy of the brain. By the way  if this patient then goes  and mother phones from an adjacent room    phones him    and he picks up the phone  and he says   Wow  mom  how are you  Where are you   There's no delusion through the phone. Then  she approaches him after an hour  he says   Who are you  You look just like my mother.  OK  The reason is there's a separate pathway going from the hearing centers in the brain to the emotional centers  and that's not been cut by the accident. So this explains why through the phone he recognizes his mother  no problem. When he sees her in person  he says it's an impostor. OK  how is all this complex circuitry set up in the brain  Is it nature  genes  or is it nurture  And we approach this problem by considering another curious syndrome called phantom limb. And you all know what a phantom limb is. When an arm is amputated  or a leg is amputated  for gangrene  or you lose it in war    for example  in the Iraq war  it's now a serious problem    you continue to vividly feel the presence of that missing arm  and that's called a phantom arm or a phantom leg. In fact  you can get a phantom with almost any part of the body. Believe it or not  even with internal viscera. I've had patients with the uterus removed    hysterectomy    who have a phantom uterus  including phantom menstrual cramps at the appropriate time of the month. And in fact  one student asked me the other day   Do they get phantom PMS   A subject ripe for scientific enquiry  but we haven't pursued that. OK  now the next question is  what can you learn about phantom limbs by doing experiments  One of the things we've found was  about half the patients with phantom limbs claim that they can move the phantom. It'll pat his brother on the shoulder  it'll answer the phone when it rings  it'll wave goodbye. These are very compelling  vivid sensations. The patient's not delusional. He knows that the arm is not there  but  nevertheless  it's a compelling sensory experience for the patient. But however  about half the patients  this doesn't happen. The phantom limb    they'll say   But doctor  the phantom limb is paralyzed. It's fixed in a clenched spasm and it's excruciatingly painful. If only I could move it  maybe the pain will be relieved.  Now  why would a phantom limb be paralyzed  It sounds like an oxymoron. But when we were looking at the case sheets  what we found was  these people with the paralyzed phantom limbs  the original arm was paralyzed because of the peripheral nerve injury. The actual nerve supplying the arm was severed  was cut  by say  a motorcycle accident. So the patient had an actual arm  which is painful  in a sling for a few months or a year  and then  in a misguided attempt to get rid of the pain in the arm  the surgeon amputates the arm  and then you get a phantom arm with the same pains  right  And this is a serious clinical problem. Patients become depressed. Some of them are driven to suicide  OK  So  how do you treat this syndrome  Now  why do you get a paralyzed phantom limb  When I looked at the case sheet  I found that they had an actual arm  and the nerves supplying the arm had been cut  and the actual arm had been paralyzed  and lying in a sling for several months before the amputation  and this pain then gets carried over into the phantom itself. Why does this happen  When the arm was intact  but paralyzed  the brain sends commands to the arm  the front of the brain  saying   Move   but it's getting visual feedback saying   No.  Move. No. Move. No. Move. No. And this gets wired into the circuitry of the brain  and we call this learned paralysis  OK  The brain learns  because of this Hebbian  associative link  that the mere command to move the arm creates a sensation of a paralyzed arm. And then  when you've amputated the arm  this learned paralysis carries over into your body image and into your phantom  OK  Now  how do you help these patients  How do you unlearn the learned paralysis  so you can relieve him of this excruciating  clenching spasm of the phantom arm  Well  we said  what if you now send the command to the phantom  but give him visual feedback that it's obeying his command  right  Maybe you can relieve the phantom pain  the phantom cramp. How do you do that  Well  virtual reality. But that costs millions of dollars. So  I hit on a way of doing this for three dollars  but don't tell my funding agencies. OK  What you do is you create what I call a mirror box. You have a cardboard box with a mirror in the middle  and then you put the phantom    so my first patient  Derek  came in. He had his arm amputated    years ago. He had a brachial avulsion  so the nerves were cut and the arm was paralyzed  lying in a sling for a year  and then the arm was amputated. He had a phantom arm  excruciatingly painful  and he couldn't move it. It was a paralyzed phantom arm. So he came there  and I gave him a mirror like that  in a box  which I call a mirror box  right  And the patient puts his phantom left arm  which is clenched and in spasm  on the left side of the mirror  and the normal hand on the right side of the mirror  and makes the same posture  the clenched posture  and looks inside the mirror. And what does he experience  He looks at the phantom being resurrected  because he's looking at the reflection of the normal arm in the mirror  and it looks like this phantom has been resurrected.  Now   I said   now  look  wiggle your phantom    your real fingers  or move your real fingers while looking in the mirror.  He's going to get the visual impression that the phantom is moving  right  That's obvious  but the astonishing thing is  the patient then says   Oh my God  my phantom is moving again  and the pain  the clenching spasm  is relieved.  And remember  my first patient who came in       thank you.  Applause  My first patient came in  and he looked in the mirror  and I said   Look at your reflection of your phantom.  And he started giggling  he says   I can see my phantom.  But he's not stupid. He knows it's not real. He knows it's a mirror reflection  but it's a vivid sensory experience. Now  I said   Move your normal hand and phantom.  He said   Oh  I can't move my phantom. You know that. It's painful.  I said   Move your normal hand.  And he says   Oh my God  my phantom is moving again. I don't believe this  And my pain is being relieved.  OK  And then I said   Close your eyes.  He closes his eyes.  And move your normal hand.   Oh  nothing. It's clenched again.   OK  open your eyes.   Oh my God  oh my God  it's moving again   So  he was like a kid in a candy store. So  I said  OK  this proves my theory about learned paralysis and the critical role of visual input  but I'm not going to get a Nobel Prize for getting somebody to move his phantom limb. It's a completely useless ability  if you think about it. But then I started realizing  maybe other kinds of paralysis that you see in neurology  like stroke  focal dystonias    there may be a learned component to this  which you can overcome with the simple device of using a mirror. So  I said   Look  Derek     well  first of all  the guy can't just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain    I said   Look  Derek  take it home and practice with it for a week or two. Maybe  after a period of practice  you can dispense with the mirror  unlearn the paralysis  and start moving your paralyzed arm  and then  relieve yourself of pain.  So he said OK  and he took it home. I said   Look  it's  after all  two dollars. Take it home.  So  he took it home  and after two weeks  he phones me  and he said   Doctor  you're not going to believe this.  I said   What   He said   It's gone.  I said   What's gone   I thought maybe the mirror box was gone. He said   No  no  no  you know this phantom I've had for the last    years  It's disappeared.  And I said    I got worried  I said  my God  I mean I've changed this guy's body image  what about human subjects  ethics and all of that  And I said   Derek  does this bother you   He said   No  last three days  I've not had a phantom arm and therefore no phantom elbow pain  no clenching  no phantom forearm pain  all those pains are gone away. But the problem is I still have my phantom fingers dangling from the shoulder  and your box doesn't reach.   So  can you change the design and put it on my forehead  so I can  you know  do this and eliminate my phantom fingers   He thought I was some kind of magician. Now  why does this happen  It's because the brain is faced with tremendous sensory conflict. It's getting messages from vision saying the phantom is back. On the other hand  there's no proprioception  muscle signals saying that there is no arm  right  And your motor command saying there is an arm  and  because of this conflict  the brain says  to hell with it  there is no phantom  there is no arm  right  It goes into a sort of denial    it gates the signals. And when the arm disappears  the bonus is  the pain disappears because you can't have disembodied pain floating out there  in space. So  that's the bonus. Now  this technique has been tried on dozens of patients by other groups in Helsinki  so it may prove to be valuable as a treatment for phantom pain  and indeed  people have tried it for stroke rehabilitation. Stroke you normally think of as damage to the fibers  nothing you can do about it. But  it turns out some component of stroke paralysis is also learned paralysis  and maybe that component can be overcome using mirrors. This has also gone through clinical trials  helping lots and lots of patients. OK  let me switch gears now to the third part of my talk  which is about another curious phenomenon called synesthesia. This was discovered by Francis Galton in the nineteenth century. He was a cousin of Charles Darwin. He pointed out that certain people in the population  who are otherwise completely normal  had the following peculiarity  every time they see a number  it's colored. Five is blue  seven is yellow  eight is chartreuse  nine is indigo  OK  Bear in mind  these people are completely normal in other respects. Or C sharp    sometimes  tones evoke color. C sharp is blue  F sharp is green  another tone might be yellow  right  Why does this happen  This is called synesthesia. Galton called it synesthesia  a mingling of the senses. In us  all the senses are distinct. These people muddle up their senses. Why does this happen  One of the two aspects of this problem are very intriguing. Synesthesia runs in families  so Galton said this is a hereditary basis  a genetic basis. Secondly  synesthesia is about    and this is what gets me to my point about the main theme of this lecture  which is about creativity    synesthesia is eight times more common among artists  poets  novelists and other creative people than in the general population. Why would that be  I'm going to answer that question. It's never been answered before. OK  what is synesthesia  What causes it  Well  there are many theories. One theory is they're just crazy. Now  that's not really a scientific theory  so we can forget about it. Another theory is they are acid junkies and potheads  right  Now  there may be some truth to this  because it's much more common here in the Bay Area than in San Diego. OK. Now  the third theory is that    well  let's ask ourselves what's really going on in synesthesia. All right  So  we found that the color area and the number area are right next to each other in the brain  in the fusiform gyrus. So we said  there's some accidental cross wiring between color and numbers in the brain. So  every time you see a number  you see a corresponding color  and that's why you get synesthesia. Now remember    why does this happen  Why would there be crossed wires in some people  Remember I said it runs in families  That gives you the clue. And that is  there is an abnormal gene  a mutation in the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring. In all of us  it turns out we are born with everything wired to everything else. So  every brain region is wired to every other region  and these are trimmed down to create the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain. So  if there's a gene causing this trimming and if that gene mutates  then you get deficient trimming between adjacent brain areas. And if it's between number and color  you get number color synesthesia. If it's between tone and color  you get tone color synesthesia. So far  so good. Now  what if this gene is expressed everywhere in the brain  so everything is cross connected  Well  think about what artists  novelists and poets have in common  the ability to engage in metaphorical thinking  linking seemingly unrelated ideas  such as   It is the east  and Juliet is the Sun.  Well  you don't say  Juliet is the sun  does that mean she's a glowing ball of fire  I mean  schizophrenics do that  but it's a different story  right  Normal people say  she's warm like the sun  she's radiant like the sun  she's nurturing like the sun. Instantly  you've found the links. Now  if you assume that this greater cross wiring and concepts are also in different parts of the brain  then it's going to create a greater propensity towards metaphorical thinking and creativity in people with synesthesia. And  hence  the eight times more common incidence of synesthesia among poets  artists and novelists. OK  it's a very phrenological view of synesthesia. The last demonstration    can I take one minute  OK. I'm going to show you that you're all synesthetes  but you're in denial about it. Here's what I call Martian alphabet. Just like your alphabet  A is A  B is B  C is C. Different shapes for different phonemes  right  Here  you've got Martian alphabet. One of them is Kiki  one of them is Buba. Which one is Kiki and which one is Buba  How many of you think that's Kiki and that's Buba  Raise your hands. Well  it's one or two mutants. How many of you think that's Buba  that's Kiki  Raise your hands. Ninety nine percent of you. Now  none of you is a Martian. How did you do that  It's because you're all doing a cross model synesthetic abstraction  meaning you're saying that that sharp inflection    ki ki  in your auditory cortex  the hair cells being excited    Kiki  mimics the visual inflection  sudden inflection of that jagged shape. Now  this is very important  because what it's telling you is your brain is engaging in a primitive    it's just    it looks like a silly illusion  but these photons in your eye are doing this shape  and hair cells in your ear are exciting the auditory pattern  but the brain is able to extract the common denominator. It's a primitive form of abstraction  and we now know this happens in the fusiform gyrus of the brain  because when that's damaged  these people lose the ability to engage in Buba Kiki  but they also lose the ability to engage in metaphor. If you ask this guy  what     all that glitters is not gold   what does that mean   The patient says   Well  if it's metallic and shiny  it doesn't mean it's gold. You have to measure its specific gravity  OK   So  they completely miss the metaphorical meaning. So  this area is about eight times the size in higher    especially in humans    as in lower primates. Something very interesting is going on here in the angular gyrus  because it's the crossroads between hearing  vision and touch  and it became enormous in humans. And something very interesting is going on. And I think it's a basis of many uniquely human abilities like abstraction  metaphor and creativity. All of these questions that philosophers have been studying for millennia  we scientists can begin to explore by doing brain imaging  and by studying patients and asking the right questions. Thank you. Sorry about that. You know  there's a small country nestled in the Himalayan Mountains  far from these beautiful mountains  where the people of the Kingdom of Bhutan have decided to do something different  which is to measure their gross national happiness rather than their gross national product. And why not  After all  happiness is not just a privilege for the lucky few  but a fundamental human right for all. And what is happiness  Happiness is the freedom of choice. The freedom to chose where to live  what to do  what to buy  what to sell  from whom  to whom  when and how. Where does choice come from  And who gets to express it  and how do we express it  Well  one way to express choice is through the market. Well functioning markets provide choices  and ultimately  the ability to express one's pursuit for happiness. The great Indian economist  Amartya Sen  was awarded the Nobel prize for demonstrating that famine is not so much about the availability of food supply  but rather the ability to acquire or entitle oneself to that food through the market. In       in what can only be considered one of the greatest crimes of humanity  nearly one million people died of starvation in my country of birth  Ethiopia. Not because there was not enough food    because there was actually a surplus of food in the fertile regions of the south parts of the country    but because in the north  people could not access or entitle themselves to that food. That was a turning point for my life. Most Africans today  by far  are farmers. And most of Africa's farmers are  by and large  small farmers in terms of land that they operate  and very  very small farmers in terms of the capital they have at their disposal. African agriculture today is among  or is  the most under capitalized in the world. Only seven percent of arable land in Africa is irrigated  compared to    percent in Asia. African farmers only use some    kilograms of fertilizer per hectare  compared to     in Asia. Road density is six times greater in Asia than it is in rural Africa. There are eight times more tractors in Latin America  and three times more tractors in Asia  than in Africa. The small farmer in Africa today lives a life without much choice  and therefore without much freedom. His livelihood is predetermined by the conditions of grinding poverty. He comes to the market when prices are lowest  with the meager fruits of his hard labor  just after the harvest  because he has no choice. She comes back to the market some months later  when prices are highest  in what we call the lean season    when food is scarce    because she has to feed her family and has no choice. The real question is  how can markets be developed in rural Africa to harness the power of innovation and entrepreneurship that we know exists  Another notable economist  Theodore Schultz  in      won the Nobel prize for demonstrating that farmers are efficient  but poor. Meaning  in fact  that farmers are rational and profit minded just like everybody else. Well  we don't need  now  any more Nobel prizes to know that farmers want a fair shake at the market and want to make money  just like everyone else. And one thing is clear  which is at least now we know that Africa is open for business. And that business is agriculture. Over two decades ago  the world insisted to Africa that markets must be liberalized  that economies must be structurally adjusted. This meant that governments were to remove themselves from the business of buying and selling    which they did rather inefficiently    and let the private market do its magic. Well  what happened over the last    years  Did Africa feed itself  Did our farmers turn into highly productive commercial actors  I think we're all in this room  probably  because we know that  in fact  Africa is the only region in the world where hunger and malnutrition are projected to go up over the next    years  where the food import bill is now double what it was    years ago  where food production per capita has stagnated  and where fertilizer use has declined rather than increased. So why didn't agriculture markets perform to expectations  The market reforms prompted by the West    and I've spent some    years traveling around the continent doing research on agricultural markets  and have interviewed traders in    to    countries in this continent  hundreds of traders    trying to understand what went wrong with our market reform. And it seems to me that the reforms might have thrown the baby out with the bath water. Like its agriculture  Africa's markets are highly under capitalized and inefficient. We know from our work around the continent that transaction costs of reaching the market  and the risks of transacting in rural  agriculture markets  are extremely high. In fact  only one third of agricultural output produced in Africa even reaches the market. Africa's markets are weak not only because of weak infrastructure in terms of roads and telecommunications  but also because of the virtual absence of necessary market institutions  such as market information  grades and standards  and reliable ways to connect buyers and sellers. Because of this  commodity buyers and sellers typically transact in small circles  in narrow networks of people they know and trust. And because of that  as grain changes hands    and I've measured that it changes hands four  five times in its trajectory from the farmer to the consumer    every time it changes hands    and I've seen this all over rural Africa    it also changes sacks. And I thought that was incredibly peculiar. And really realized that that was because    as traders would tell me over and over    that's the only way people know what they're getting in terms of the quantity and the product quality. And that actually has huge implications for the ability of markets to quickly respond to price signals  and situations where there are deficits  for example. It also has very high cost implications. I have measured that    percent of the marketing margin is simply due to the fact that  because of the absence of grades and standards and market information  sacks have to be constantly changed. And this leads to very high handling costs. For their part  small farmers  who produce the bulk of our agricultural output in Africa  come to the market with virtually no information at all    blind    trusting that they're going to have some sort of demand for their produce  and completely at the mercy of the merchants in the only market  the nearest local market they know    where they're unable to negotiate better prices or reduce their risk. Speaking of risk  we have seen that price volatility of food crops in Africa is the highest in the world. In Africa  small farmers bear the brunt of this risk. In fact  in my view  there is no region of the world and no period in history that farmers have been expected to bear the kind of market risk that Africa's farmers have to bear. And in my view  there is simply no place in the world that has grown its agriculture on the kind of risk that our farmers in Africa today face. In Ethiopia  for example  the variation in maize prices from year to year is as much as    percent annually. This kind of market risk is mind boggling  and has direct implications for not only the incentives of farmers to invest in higher productivity technology  such as modern seeds and fertilizers  but also direct implications for food security. To give you an example  between      and       Ethiopian maize farmers produced two years of bumper harvest. That in turn  because of the weak marketing system  led to an    percent collapse in maize prices in the country. This made it unprofitable for some farmers to even harvest the grain from the fields. And we calculated that some         tons of grain was left in the fields to rot in early     . Not six months later  in July       Ethiopia announced a major food crisis  to the same proportions as          million people at risk of starvation. What also happened that year is in the areas where there were good rains  and where farmers had previously produced surplus grain  farmers had decided to withdraw from the fertilizer market  not use fertilizer and actually had dropped their use of fertilizer by    percent. This is a tragic example of arrested development  or a budding green revolution stopped in its tracks. And this is not just specific to Ethiopia  but happens over and over  all over Africa. Well  I'm not here today to lament about the situation  or wring my hands. I am here to tell you that change is in the air. Africa today is not the Africa waiting for aid solutions  or cookie cutter foreign expert policy prescriptions. Africa has learned  or is learning somewhat slowly  that markets don't happen by themselves. In the     s  it was very fashionable to talk about getting prices right. There was a very influential book about that  which was mainly about getting governments out of the market. We now recognize that getting markets right is about not just price incentives  but also investing in the right infrastructure and the appropriate and necessary institutions to create the conditions to unleash the power of innovation in the market. When conditions are right  we know and see that that innovation is ready to explode in rural Africa  just like anywhere else. Nearly three years ago  I decided to leave my comfortable job as a World Bank senior economist in Washington and come back to my country of birth  Ethiopia  after nearly    years abroad. I did so for a simple reason. After having spent more than a decade understanding  studying  and trying to convince policymakers and donors about what was wrong with Africa's agricultural markets  I decided it was time to do something about it. I currently lead  in Ethiopia  an exciting new initiative to establish the first Ethiopia Commodity Exchange  or ECX. Now  the commodity exchange itself  that concept  is not new to the world. In fact  in          grain merchants and farmers got together in a small town at the crossroads of the Illinois River and Lake Michigan to establish a way to trade better amongst themselves. That was  of course  the birth of the Chicago Board of Trade  which is the most famous commodity exchange in the world. The Chicago Board of Trade was established then for precisely the same reasons that our farmers today would benefit from a commodity exchange. In the American Midwest  farmers used to load grain onto barges and send it upriver to the Chicago market. But once it arrived  if no buyer was to be found  or if prices suddenly dropped  farmers would incur tremendous losses. And in fact  would even dump the grain in Lake Michigan  rather than spend more money transporting it back to their farms. Well  the need to avoid these huge risks and tremendous losses led to the birth of the futures market  and the underlying system of grading grain and receipting    issuing warehouse receipts on the basis of which trade could be done. From there  the greatest innovation of all came about in this market  which is that buyers and sellers could transact grain without actually having to physically or visually inspect the grain. That meant that grain could be traded across tremendous distances  and even across time    as far forward as    months into the future. This innovation is at the heart of the transformation of American agriculture  and the rise of Chicago to a global market  agricultural market  superpower from where it was  a small regional town. Now  over the last century  we tend to think of commodity exchanges as the purview of Western industrialized countries  and that the reference prices for cotton  coffee  cocoa    products produced mainly in the south    are actually a reference price  or a price discovered in these organized commodity exchanges in the northern countries. But that is actually changing. And we're seeing a shift    powered mainly because of information technology    a shift in market dominance towards the emerging markets. And over the last decade  you see that the share of Western exchanges    and this is the U.S. share of exchanges in the world    has gone down by nearly half in just the last decade. Similarly  there's been explosive growth in India  for example  where rural farmers are using exchanges    growing here over the last three years by     percent a year. This is powered by low cost VSAT technology  aggressively trying to reach farmers to bring them into the market. China's Dalian Commodity Exchange  three years ago        overtook the Chicago Board of Trade to become the second largest commodity exchange in the world. Now  in Ethiopia  we're in the process of designing the first organized Ethiopia Commodity Exchange. We're not trying to cut and paste the Chicago model or the India model  but creating a system uniquely tailored to Ethiopia's needs and realities  Ethiopia's small farmers. So  the ECX is an Ethiopian exchange for Ethiopia. We're creating a system that serves all market actors  that creates integrity  trust  efficiency  transparency and enables small farmers to manage the risks that I have described. In the design of our commodity exchange in Ethiopia  we've done something rather unique  which is to take the approach of an integrated perspective  or what we call the ECX Edge. The ECX Edge pretty much creates the entire ecosystem in which the market will develop itself. And this is because one of the things we've learned over the last decade of studying market development in Africa is that the piecemeal approach does not work. You've got one donor trying to develop market information  another trying to work on or sponsor grades and standards  another ICT  and yet another on warehousing  or warehouse receipts. In our approach in Ethiopia  we've decided to put together the entire ecosystem  or environment  in which trade takes place. That means that the exchange will operate a trading system  which will initially start as an open outcry  because we don't think the country's ready for full electronic trading. But at the same time  we'll do something which I think no exchange in the world has ever done  which is itself to operate something like an Internet cafe in the rural areas. So that farmers and small traders can actually come to a terminal center    what we call the remote access terminal centers    and actually  without having to buy a computer or figure out how to dial up or any of those things  simply see the trading that's happening on the Addis Ababa trading floor. At the same time  what's very fundamental to this market is that    and again  an innovation that we've designed for our exchange    is that the exchange will operate warehouses around the country  in which grade certification and warehouse receipting will be done. And in turn  we'll operate an in house clearing system  to assure that payment is done appropriately  in the right amount and at the right time  so that basically  we create trust and integrity in the system. Obviously  we work with exchange actors  and as we're developing the exchange market itself  we're also developing the regulatory infrastructure and legal framework  the overarching legal framework for making this market work. So  in fact  our proclamation is going to parliament next month. What's really important is that the ECX will operate a market information system to disseminate prices in real time to farmers around the country  using VSAT technology to bring an electronic price dissemination directly to farmers. What this does is transforms  fundamentally  the farmers' relationship to the market. Whereas before the farmer used to think local    meaning that he or she would go to the nearest local market  eight to    kilometers away on average  and sell whatever they happened to have  without any idea of what the price premium or anything else was    now farmers come with knowledge of what prices are at the national market. And they start to think national  and even global. They start to make not only commercial marketing decisions  but also planting decisions  on the basis of information coming from the futures price market. And they come to the market knowing what grades their products will achieve in terms of a price premium. So all of this will transform farmers. It will also transform the way traders do business. It will stop them from doing simple  back to back  limited arbitrage to really thinking strategically about how to move grain across long distances from  surplus regions  to  deficit areas . Can Ethiopia do this  It seems very ambitious. But it will create new opportunities. We believe that this initiative requires great political will  and we'll have to align the financial sector  as well as the ICT sector  and really even the underlying legal framework. We believe that the winds of change are here  and that we can do it. ECX is the market for Ethiopia's new millennium  which starts in about eight months. The last parliament of our century opened with our president announcing to the country that this was the most important economic initiative for the country today. We believe that the stakes are high  but that the returns will be even greater. ECX  moreover  can become a trading platform for a pan African market in agricultural commodities. Ethiopia's domestic market is about one billion dollars of value. And we feel that over the next five years  if Ethiopia can capture even    percent  just    percent  of the domestic market  and add just    percent value to that market  the value of the market doubles. Ethiopia's agricultural market is    percent higher than South Africa's grain production  and  in fact  Ethiopia is the second largest maize producer in Africa. So the potential is there. The will is there. The commitment is there. So we feel that we have a winning value proposition to transform farmers' choices  to grow our agriculture  and to change Africa. So  we are in the business of finding our happiness. Thank you very much. I'd like to do pretty much what I did the first time  which is to choose a light hearted theme. Last time  I talked about death and dying. This time  I'm going to talk about mental illness. But it has to be technological  so I'll talk about electroshock therapy.  Laughter  You know  ever since man had any notion that some of his other people  his colleagues  could be different  could be strange  could be severely depressed or what we now recognize as schizophrenia  he was certain that this kind of illness had to come from evil spirits getting into the body. So  the way of treating these diseases in early times was to  in some way or other  exorcise those evil spirits  and this is still going on  as you know. But it wasn't enough to use the priests. When medicine became somewhat scientific  in about     BC  with Hippocrates and those boys  they tried to look for herbs  plants that would literally shake the bad spirits out. So  they found certain plants that could cause convulsions. And the herbals  the botanical books of up to the late Middle Ages  the Renaissance are filled with prescriptions for causing convulsions to shake the evil spirits out. Finally  in about the sixteenth century  a physician whose name was Theophrastus Bombastus Aureolus von Hohenheim  called Paracelsus  a name probably familiar to some people here    found that he could predict the degree of convulsion by using a measured amount of camphor to produce the convulsion. Can you imagine going to your closet  pulling out a mothball  and chewing on it if you're feeling depressed  It's better than Prozac  but I wouldn't recommend it. So what we see in the seventeenth  eighteenth century is the continued search for medications other than camphor that'll do the trick. Well  along comes Benjamin Franklin  and he comes close to convulsing himself with a bolt of electricity off the end of his kite. And so people begin thinking in terms of electricity to produce convulsions. And then  we fast forward to about       when three Italian psychiatrists  who were largely treating depression  began to notice among their patients  who were also epileptics  that if they had an epileptic    a series of epileptic fits  a lot of them in a row    the depression would very frequently lift. Not only would it lift  but it might never return. So they got very interested in producing convulsions  measured types of convulsions. And they thought   Well  we've got electricity  we'll plug somebody into the wall. That always makes hair stand up and people shake a lot.  So  they tried it on a few pigs  and none of the pigs were killed. So  they went to the police and they said   We know that at the Rome railroad station  there are all these lost souls wandering around  muttering gibberish. Can you bring one of them to us   Someone who is  as the Italians say   cagoots.  So they found this  cagoots  guy  a    year old man who was really hopelessly schizophrenic  who was known  had been known for months  to be literally defecating on himself  talking nothing that made any sense  and they brought him into the hospital. So these three psychiatrists  after about two or three weeks of observation  laid him down on a table  connected his temples to a very small source of current. They thought   Well  we'll try    volts  two tenths of a second. That's not going to do anything terrible to him.  So they did that. Well  I have the following from a firsthand observer  who told me this about    years ago  when I was thinking about these things for some research project of mine. He said   This fellow     remember  he wasn't even put to sleep     after this major grand mal convulsion  sat right up  looked at these three fellas and said  'What the fuck are you assholes trying to do '   If I could only say that in Italian. Well  they were happy as could be  because he hadn't said a rational word in the weeks of observation. So they plugged him in again  and this time they used     volts for half a second. And to their amazement  after it was over  he began speaking like he was perfectly well. He relapsed a little bit  they gave him a series of treatments  and he was essentially cured. But of course  having schizophrenia  within a few months  it returned. But they wrote a paper about this  and everybody in the Western world began using electricity to convulse people who were either schizophrenic or severely depressed. It didn't work very well on the schizophrenics  but it was pretty clear in the '  s and by the middle of the '  s that electroconvulsive therapy was very  very effective in the treatment of depression. And of course  in those days  there were no antidepressant drugs  and it became very  very popular. They would anesthetize people  convulse them  but the real difficulty was that there was no way to paralyze muscles. So people would have a real grand mal seizure. Bones were broken. Especially in old  fragile people  you couldn't use it. And then in the     s  late     s  the so called muscle relaxants were developed by pharmacologists  and it got so that you could induce a complete convulsion  an electroencephalographic convulsion    you could see it on the brain waves    without causing any convulsion in the body except a little bit of twitching of the toes. So again  it was very  very popular and very  very useful. Well  you know  in the middle '  s  the first antidepressants came out. Tofranil was the first. In the late '  s  early '  s  there were others  and they were very effective. And patients' rights groups seemed to get very upset about the kinds of things that they would witness. And so the whole idea of electroconvulsive  electroshock therapy disappeared  but has had a renaissance in the last    years. And the reason that it has had a renaissance is that probably about    percent of the people  severe depressives  do not respond  regardless of what is done for them. Now  why am I telling you this story at this meeting  I'm telling you this story  because actually ever since Richard called me and asked me to talk about    as he asked all of his speakers    to talk about something that would be new to this audience  that we had never talked about  never written about  I've been planning this moment. This reason really is that I am a man who  almost    years ago  had his life saved by two long courses of electroshock therapy. And let me tell you this story. I was  in the     s  in a marriage. To use the word bad would be perhaps the understatement of the year. It was dreadful. There are  I'm sure  enough divorced people in this room to know about the hostility  the anger  who knows what. Being someone who had had a very difficult childhood  a very difficult adolescence    it had to do with not quite poverty but close. It had to do with being brought up in a family where no one spoke English  no one could read or write English. It had to do with death and disease and lots of other things. I was a little prone to depression. So  as things got worse  as we really began to hate each other  I became progressively depressed over a period of a couple of years  trying to save this marriage  which was inevitably not to be saved. Finally  I would schedule    all my major surgical cases  I was scheduling them for     one o'clock in the afternoon  because I couldn't get out of bed before about    o'clock. And anybody who's been depressed here knows what that's like. I couldn't even pull the covers off myself. Well  you're in a university medical center  where everybody knows everybody  and it's perfectly clear to my colleagues  so my referrals began to decrease. As my referrals began to decrease  I clearly became increasingly depressed until I thought  my God  I can't work anymore. And  in fact  it didn't make any difference because I didn't have any patients anymore. So  with the advice of my physician  I had myself admitted to the acute care psychiatric unit of our university hospital. And my colleagues  who had known me since medical school in that place  said   Don't worry  chap. Six weeks  you're back in the operating room. Everything's going to be great.  Well  you know what bovine stercus is  That proved to be a lot of bovine stercus. I know some people who got tenure in that place with lies like that. So I was one of their failures. But it wasn't that simple. Because by the time I got out of that unit  I was not functional at all. I could hardly see five feet in front of myself. I shuffled when I walked. I was bowed over. I rarely bathed. I sometimes didn't shave. It was dreadful. And it was clear    not to me  because nothing was clear to me at that time anymore    that I would need long term hospitalization in that awful place called a mental hospital. So I was admitted  in       in the spring of       to the Institute of Living  which used to be called the Hartford Retreat. It was founded in the eighteenth century  the largest psychiatric hospital in the state of Connecticut  other than the huge public hospitals that existed at that time. And they tried everything they had. They tried the usual psychotherapy. They tried every medication available in those days. And they did have Tofranil and other things    Mellaril  who knows what. Nothing happened except that I got jaundiced from one of these things. And finally  because I was well known in Connecticut  they decided they better have a meeting of the senior staff. All the senior staff got together  and I later found out what happened. They put all their heads together and they decided that there was nothing that could be done for this surgeon who had essentially separated himself from the world  who by that time had become so overwhelmed  not just with depression and feelings of worthlessness and inadequacy  but with obsessional thinking  obsessional thinking about coincidences. And there were particular numbers that every time I saw them  just got me dreadfully upset    all kinds of ritualistic observances  just awful  awful stuff. Remember when you were a kid  and you had to step on every line  Well  I was a grown man who had all of these rituals  and it got so there was a throbbing  there was a ferocious fear in my head. You've seen this painting by Edvard Munch  The Scream. Every moment was a scream. It was impossible. So they decided there was no therapy  there was no treatment. But there was one treatment  which actually had been pioneered at the Hartford hospital in the early     s  and you can imagine what it was. It was pre frontal lobotomy. So they decided    I didn't know this  again  I found this out later    that the only thing that could be done was for this    year old man to have a pre frontal lobotomy. Well  as in all hospitals  there was a resident assigned to my case. He was    years old  and he would meet with me two or three times a week. And of course  I had been there  what  three or four months at the time. And he asked to meet with the senior staff  and they agreed to meet with him because he was very well thought of in that place. They thought he had a really extraordinary future. And he dug in his heels and said   No. I know this man better than any of you. I have met with him over and over again. You've just seen him from time to time. You've read reports and so forth. I really honestly believe that the basic problem here is pure depression  and all of the obsessional thinking comes out of it. And you know  of course  what'll happen if you do a pre frontal lobotomy. Any of the results along the spectrum  from pretty bad to terrible  terrible  terrible is going to happen. If he does the best he can  he will have no further obsessions  probably no depression  but his affect will be dulled  he will never go back to surgery  he will never be the loving father that he was to his two children  his life will be changed. If he has the usual result  he will end up like 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.' And you know about that  just essentially in a stupor the rest of his life.  Well  he said   Can't we try a course of electroshock therapy   And you know why they agreed  They agreed to humor him. They just thought   Well  we'll give a course of   . And so we'll lose a little time. Big deal. It doesn't make any difference.  So they gave the course of     and the first    the usual course  incidentally  was six to eight and still is six to eight. Plugged me into the wires  put me to sleep  gave me the muscle relaxant. Six didn't work. Seven didn't work. Eight didn't work. At nine  I noticed    and it's wonderful that I could notice anything    I noticed a change. And at     I noticed a real change. And he went back to them  and they agreed to do another   . Again  not a single one of them    I think there are about seven or eight of them    thought this would do any good. They thought this was a temporary change. But  lo and behold  by     by     there were demonstrable differences in the way I felt. By    and     I was sleeping through the night. And by     I had the sense  I really had the sense that I could overcome this  that I was now strong enough that by an act of will  I could blow the obsessional thinking away. I could blow the depression away. And I've never forgotten    I never will forget    standing in the kitchen of the unit  it was a Sunday morning in January of       standing in the kitchen by myself and thinking   I've got the strength now to do this.  It was as though those tightly coiled wires in my head had been disconnected and I could think clearly. But I need a formula. I need some thing to say to myself when I begin thinking obsessionally  obsessively. Well  the Gilbert and Sullivan fans in this room will remember  Ruddigore   and they will remember Mad Margaret  and they will remember that she was married to a fellow named Sir Despard Murgatroyd. And she used to go nuts  every five minutes or so in the play  and he said to her   We must have a word to bring you back to reality  and the word  my dear  will be 'Basingstoke.'  So every time she got a little nuts  he would say   Basingstoke   And she would say   Basingstoke  it is.  And she would be fine for a little while. Well  you know  I'm from the Bronx. I can't say  Basingstoke.  But I had something better. And it was very simple. It was   Ah  fuck it   at least for me. And it worked    my God  it worked. Every time I would begin thinking obsessionally    again  once more  after    shock treatments    I would say   Ah  fuck it.  And things got better and better  and within three or four months  I was discharged from that hospital  and I joined a group of surgeons where I could work with other people in the community  not in New Haven  but fairly close by. I stayed there for three years. At the end of three years  I went back to New Haven  had remarried by that time. I brought my wife with me  actually  to make sure I could get through this. My children came back to live with us. We had two more children after that. Resuscitated the career  even better than it had been before. Went right back into the university and began to write books. Well  you know  it's been a wonderful life. It's been  as I said  close to    years. I stopped doing surgery about six years ago and became a full time writer  as many people know. But it's been very exciting. It's been very happy. Every once in a while  I have to say   Ah  fuck it.  Every once in a while  I get somewhat depressed and a little obsessional. So  I'm not free of all of this. But it's worked. It's always worked. Why have I chosen  after never  ever talking about this  to talk about it now  Well  those of you who know some of these books know that one is about death and dying  one is about the human body and the human spirit  one is about the way mystical thoughts are constantly in our minds  and they have always to do with my own personal experiences. One might think reading these books    and I've gotten thousands of letters about them by people who do think this    that based on my life's history as I've portrayed in the books  my early life's history  I am someone who has overcome adversity. That I am someone who has drunk  drank  drunk of the bitter dregs of near disaster in childhood and emerged not just unscathed but strengthened. I really have it figured out  so that I can advise people about death and dying  so that I can talk about mysticism and the human spirit. And I've always felt guilty about that. I've always felt that somehow I was an impostor because my readers don't know what I have just told you. It's known by some people in New Haven  obviously  but it is not generally known. So one of the reasons that I have come here to talk about this today is to    frankly  selfishly    unburden myself and let it be known that this is not an untroubled mind that has written all of these books. But more importantly  I think  is the fact that a very significant proportion of people in this audience are under     and there are many  of course  who are well over   . For people under     and it looks to me like almost all of you    I would say all of you    are either on the cusp of a magnificent and exciting career or right into a magnificent and exciting career  anything can happen to you. Things change. Accidents happen. Something from childhood comes back to haunt you. You can be thrown off the track. I hope it happens to none of you  but it will probably happen to a small percentage of you. To those to whom it doesn't happen  there will be adversities. If I  with the bleakness of spirit  with no spirit  that I had in the     s and no possibility of recovery  as far as that group of very experienced psychiatrists thought  if I can find my way back from this  believe me  anybody can find their way back from any adversity that exists in their lives. And for those who are older  who have lived through perhaps not something as bad as this  but who have lived through difficult times  perhaps where they lost everything  as I did  and started out all over again  some of these things will seem very familiar. There is recovery. There is redemption. And there is resurrection. There are resurrection themes in every society that has ever been studied  and it is because not just only do we fantasize about the possibility of resurrection and recovery  but it actually happens. And it happens a lot. Perhaps the most popular resurrection theme  outside of specifically religious ones  is the one about the phoenix  the ancient story of the phoenix  who  every     years  resurrects itself from its own ashes to go on to live a life that is even more beautiful than it was before. Richard  thanks very much.
