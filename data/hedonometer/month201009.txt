Tyler Dewar  The way I feel right now is that all of the other speakers have said exactly what I wanted to say. And it seems that the only thing left for me to say is to thank you all for your kindness. TD  But maybe in the spirit of appreciating the kindness of you all  I could share with you a little story about myself. TD  From the time I was very young  onward  I was given a lot of different responsibilities  and it always seemed to me  when I was young  that everything was laid out before me. All of the plans for me were already made. I was given the clothes that I needed to wear and told where I needed to be  given these very precious and holy looking robes to wear  with the understanding that it was something sacred or important. TD  But before that kind of formal lifestyle happened for me  I was living in eastern Tibet with my family. And when I was seven years old  all of a sudden  a search party arrived at my home. They were looking the next Karmapa  and I noticed they were talking to my mom and dad  and the news came to me that they were telling me that I was the Karmapa. And these days  people ask me a lot  how did that feel. How did that feel when they came and whisked you away  and your lifestyle completely changed  And what I mostly say is that  at that time  it was a pretty interesting idea to me. I thought that things would be pretty fun and there would be more things to play with. TD  But it didn't turn out to be so fun and entertaining  as I thought it would have been. I was placed in a pretty strictly controlled environment. And immediately  a lot of different responsibilities  in terms of my education and so forth  were heaped upon me. I was separated  largely  from my family  including my mother and father. I didn't have have many personal friends to spend time with  but I was expected to perform these prescribed duties. So it turned out that my fantasy about an entertaining life of being the Karmapa wasn't going to come true. It more felt to be the case to me that I was being treated like a statue  and I was to sit in one place like a statue would. TD  Nevertheless  I felt that  even though I've been separated from my loved ones    and  of course  now I'm even further away. When I was     I escaped from Tibet and became even further removed from my mother and father  my relatives  my friends and my homeland. But nevertheless  there's no real sense of separation from me in my heart  in terms of the love that I feel for these people. I feel  still  a very strong connection of love for all of these people and for the land. TD  And I still do get to keep in touch with my mother and father  albeit infrequently. I talk to my mother once in a blue moon on the telephone. And my experience is that  when I'm talking to her  with every second that passes during our conversation  the feeling of love that binds us is bringing us closer and closer together. TD  So those were just a few remarks about my personal background. And in terms of other things that I wanted to share with you  in terms of ideas  I think it's wonderful to have a situation like this  where so many people from different backgrounds and places can come together  exchange their ideas and form relationships of friendship with each other. And I think that's symbolic of what we're seeing in the world in general  that the world is becoming smaller and smaller  and that all of the peoples in the world are enjoying more opportunities for connection. That's wonderful  but we should also remember that we should have a similar process happening on the inside. Along with outward development and increase of opportunity  there should be inward development and deepening of our heart connections as well as our outward connections. So we spoke and we heard some about design this week. I think that it's important for us to remember that we need to keep pushing forward on the endeavor of the design of the heart. We heard a lot about technology this week  and it's important for us to remember to invest a lot of our energy in improving the technology of the heart. TD  So  even though I'm somewhat happy about the wonderful developments that are happening in the world  still  I feel a sense of impediment  when it comes to the ability that we have to connect with each other on a heart to heart  or a mind to mind  level. I feel that there are some things that are getting in the way. TC  My relationship to this concept of heart to heart connection  or mind to mind connection  is an interesting one  because  as a spiritual leader  I'm always attempting to open my heart to others and offer myself up for heart to heart and mind to mind connections in a genuine way with other people  but at the same time  I've always been advised that I need to emphasize intelligence over the heart to heart connections  because  being someone in a position like mine  if I don't rely primarily on intelligence  then something dangerous may happen to me. So it's an interesting paradox at play there. But I had a really striking experience once  when a group from Afghanistan came to visit me  and we had a really interesting conversation. TD  So we ended up talking about the Bamiyan Buddhas  which  as you know  were destroyed some years ago in Afghanistan. But the basis of our conversation was the different approach to spirituality on the part of the Muslim and Buddhist traditions. Of course  in Muslim  because of the teachings around the concept of idolatry  you don't find as many physical representations of divinity or of spiritual liberation as you do in the Buddhist tradition  where  of course  there are many statues of the Buddha that are highly revered. So  we were talking about the differences between the traditions and what many people perceived as the tragedy of the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas  but I offered the suggestion that perhaps we could look at this in a positive way. What we saw in the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas was the depletion of matter  some solid substance falling down and disintegrating. Maybe we could look at that to be more similar to the falling of the Berlin Wall  where a divide that had kept two types of people apart had collapsed and opened up a door for further communication. So I think that  in this way  it's always possible for us to derive something positive that can help us understand one another better. TD  So  with regard to the development that we've been talking about here at this conference  I really feel that the development that we make shouldn't create a further burden for us as human beings  but should be used to improve our fundamental lifestyle of how we live in the world. TD  Of course  I rejoice in the development and the growth and the rise of the noble land of India  the great country of India  but at the same time  I think  as some of us have acknowledged  we need to be aware that some aspects of this rise are coming at the cost of the very ground on which we stand. So  as we are climbing the tree  some of the things that we're doing in order to climb the tree are actually undermining the tree's very root. And so  what I think it comes down to is a question of  not only having information of what's going on  but paying attention to that and letting that shift our motivation to become more sincere and genuinely positive. We have hear  this week  about the horrible sufferings  for example  that so many women of the world are enduring day to day. We have that information  but what often happens to us is that we don't really choose to pay attention to it. We don't really choose to allow that to cause there to be a shift in our hearts. So I think the way forward for the world    one that will bring the path of outer development in harmony with the real root of happiness    is that we allow the information that we have to really make a change in our heart. TD  So I think that sincere motivation is very important for our future well being  or deep sense of well being as humans  and I think that means sinking in to whatever it is you're doing now. Whatever work you're trying to do now to benefit the world  sink into that  get a full taste of that. TD  So  since we've been here this week  we've taken millions of breaths  collectively  and perhaps we haven't witnessed any course changes happening in our lives  but we often miss the very subtle changes. And I think that sometimes we develop grand concepts of what happiness might look like for us  but that  if we pay attention  we can see that there are little symbols of happiness in every breath that we take. TD  So  every one of you who has come here is so talented  and you have so much to offer to the world  I think it would be a good note to conclude on then to just take a moment to appreciate how fortunate we are to have come together in this way and exchanged ideas and really form a strong aspiration and energy within ourselves that we will take the good that has come from this conference  the momentum  the positivity  and we will spread that and plant it in all of the corners of the world. His Holiness the Karmapa  Tomorrow is my Talk. TD  Lakshmi has worked incredibly hard  even in inviting me  let alone everything else that she has done to make this happen  and I was somewhat resistant at times  and I was also very nervous throughout this week. I was feeling under the weather and dizzy and so forth  and people would ask me  why. I would tell them   It's because I have to talk tomorrow.  And so Lakshmi had to put up with me through all of that  but I very much appreciate the opportunity she's given me to be here. And to you  everyone  thank you very much. HH  Thank you very much. Everyone  please think of your biggest personal goal. For real    you can take a second. You've got to feel this to learn it. Take a few seconds and think of your personal biggest goal  okay  Imagine deciding right now that you're going to do it. Imagine telling someone that you meet today what you're going to do. Imagine their congratulations  and their high image of you. Doesn't it feel good to say it out loud  Don't you feel one step closer already  like it's already becoming part of your identity  Well  bad news  you should have kept your mouth shut  because that good feeling now will make you less likely to do it. The repeated psychology tests have proven that telling someone your goal makes it less likely to happen. Any time you have a goal  there are some steps that need to be done  some work that needs to be done in order to achieve it. Ideally you would not be satisfied until you'd actually done the work. But when you tell someone your goal and they acknowledge it  psychologists have found that it's called a  social reality.  The mind is kind of tricked into feeling that it's already done. And then because you've felt that satisfaction  you're less motivated to do the actual hard work necessary. So this goes against conventional wisdom that we should tell our friends our goals  right  So they hold us to it. So  let's look at the proof.       Kurt Lewin  founder of social psychology  called this  substitution.        Wera Mahler found when it was acknowledged by others  it felt real in the mind.       Peter Gollwitzer wrote a whole book about this  and in       he did some new tests that were published. It goes like this      people across four separate tests. Everyone wrote down their personal goal. Then half of them announced their commitment to this goal to the room  and half didn't. Then everyone was given    minutes of work that would directly lead them towards their goal  but they were told that they could stop at any time. Now  those who kept their mouths shut worked the entire    minutes on average  and when asked afterward  said that they felt that they had a long way to go still to achieve their goal. But those who had announced it quit after only    minutes  on average  and when asked afterward  said that they felt much closer to achieving their goal. So if this is true  what can we do  Well  you could resist the temptation to announce your goal. You can delay the gratification that the social acknowledgment brings  and you can understand that your mind mistakes the talking for the doing. But if you do need to talk about something  you can state it in a way that gives you no satisfaction  such as   I really want to run this marathon  so I need to train five times a week and kick my ass if I don't  okay   So audience  next time you're tempted to tell someone your goal  what will you say  Exactly  Well done. This strange looking plant is called the Llareta. What looks like moss covering rocks is actually a shrub comprised of thousands of branches  each containing clusters of tiny green leaves at the end and so densely packed together that you could actually stand on top of it. This individual lives in the Atacama Desert in Chile  and it happens to be       years old. It also happens to be a relative of parsley. For the past five years  I've been researching  working with biologists and traveling all over the world to find continuously living organisms that are       years old and older. The project is part art and part science. There's an environmental component. And I'm also trying to create a means in which to step outside our quotidian experience of time and to start to consider a deeper timescale. I selected       years as my minimum age because I wanted to start at what we consider to be year zero and work backward from there. What you're looking at now is a tree called Jomon Sugi  living on the remote island of Yakushima. The tree was in part a catalyst for the project. I'd been traveling in Japan without an agenda other than to photograph  and then I heard about this tree that is       years old and knew that I had to go visit it. It wasn't until later  when I was actually back home in New York that I got the idea for the project. So it was the slow churn  if you will. I think it was my longstanding desire to bring together my interest in art  science and philosophy that allowed me to be ready when the proverbial light bulb went on. So I started researching  and to my surprise  this project had never been done before in the arts or the sciences. And    perhaps naively    I was surprised to find that there isn't even an area in the sciences that deals with this idea of global species longevity. So what you're looking at here is the rhizocarpon geographicum  or map lichen  and this is around       years old and lives in Greenland  which is a long way to go for some lichens. Visiting Greenland was more like traveling back in time than just traveling very far north. It was very primal and more remote than anything I'd ever experienced before. And this is heightened by a couple of particular experiences. One was when I had been dropped off by boat on a remote fjord  only to find that the archeologists I was supposed to meet were nowhere to be found. And it's not like you could send them a text or shoot them an e mail  so I was literally left to my own devices. But luckily  it worked out obviously  but it was a humbling experience to feel so disconnected. And then a few days later  we had the opportunity to go fishing in a glacial stream near our campsite  where the fish were so abundant that you could literally reach into the stream and grab out a foot long trout with your bare hands. It was like visiting a more innocent time on the planet. And then  of course  there's the lichens. These lichens grow only one centimeter every hundred years. I think that really puts human lifespans into a different perspective. And what you're looking at here is an aerial photo take over eastern Oregon. And if the title  Searching for Armillaria Death Rings   sounds ominous  it is. The Armillaria is actually a predatory fungus  killing certain species of trees in the forest. It's also more benignly known as the honey mushroom or the  humongous fungus  because it happens to be one of the world's largest organisms as well. So with the help of some biologists studying the fungus  I got some maps and some GPS coordinates and chartered a plane and started looking for the death rings  the circular patterns in which the fungus kills the trees. So I'm not sure if there are any in this photo  but I do know the fungus is down there. And then this back down on the ground and you can see that the fungus is actually invading this tree. So that white material that you see in between the bark and the wood is the mycelial felt of the fungus  and what it's doing    it's actually slowly strangling the tree to death by preventing the flow of water and nutrients. So this strategy has served it pretty well    it's       years old. And then from underground to underwater. This is a Brain Coral living in Tobago that's around       years old. And I had to overcome my fear of deep water to find this one. This is at about    feet or    meters  depth. And you'll see  there's some damage to the surface of the coral. That was actually caused by a school of parrot fish that had started eating it  though luckily  they lost interest before killing it. Luckily still  it seems to be out of harm's way of the recent oil spill. But that being said  we just as easily could have lost one of the oldest living things on the planet  and the full impact of that disaster is still yet to be seen. Now this is something that I think is one of the most quietly resilient things on the planet. This is clonal colony of Quaking Aspen trees  living in Utah  that is literally        years old. What looks like a forest is actually only one tree. Imagine that it's one giant root system and each tree is a stem coming up from that system. So what you have is one giant  interconnected  genetically identical individual that's been living for        years. It also happens to be male and  in theory immortal. This is a clonal tree as well. This is the spruce Gran Picea  which at       years is a mere babe in the woods. The location of this tree is actually kept secret for its own protection. I spoke to the biologist who discovered this tree  and he told me that that spindly growth you see there in the center is most likely a product of climate change. As it's gotten warmer on the top of the mountain  the vegetation zone is actually changing. So we don't even necessarily have to have direct contact with these organisms to have a very real impact on them. This is the Fortingall Yew    no  I'm just kidding    this is the Fortingall Yew. But I put that slide in there because I'm often asked if there are any animals in the project. And aside from coral  the answer is no. Does anybody know how old the oldest tortoise is    any guesses  Rachel Sussman       No      is the oldest living tortoise  so nowhere near      . And then  you might have heard of this giant clam that was discovered off the coast of northern Iceland that reached     years old. However  it died in the lab as they were determining its age. The most interesting discovery of late  I think is the so called immortal jellyfish  which has actually been observed in the lab to be able to be able to revert back to the polyp state after reaching full maturity. So that being said  it's highly unlikely that any jellyfish would survive that long in the wild. And back to the yew here. So as you can see  it's in a churchyard  it's in Scotland. It's behind a protective wall. And there are actually a number or ancient yews in churchyards around the U.K.  but if you do the math  you'll remember it's actually the yew trees that were there first  then the churches. And now down to another part of the world. I had the opportunity to travel around the Limpopo Province in South Africa with an expert in Baobab trees. And we saw a number of them  and this is most likely the oldest. It's around        and it's called the Sagole Baobab. And you know  I think of all of these organisms as palimpsests. They contain thousands of years of their own histories within themselves  and they also contain records of natural and human events. And the Baobabs in particular are a great example of this. You can see that this one has names carved into its trunk  but it also records some natural events. So the Baobabs  as they get older  tend to get pulpy in their centers and hollow out. And this can create great natural shelters for animals  but they've also been appropriated for some rather dubious human uses  including a bar  a prison and even a toilet inside of a tree. And this brings me to another favorite of mine    I think  because it is just so unusual. This plant is called the Welwitschia  and it lives only in parts of coastal Namibia and Angola  where it's uniquely adapted to collect moisture from mist coming off the sea. And what's more  it's actually a tree. It's a primitive conifer. You'll notice that it's bearing cones down the center. And what looks like two big heaps of leaves  is actually two single leaves that get shredded up by the harsh desert conditions over time. And it actually never sheds those leaves  so it also bears the distinction of having the longest leaves in the plant kingdom. I spoke to a biologist at the Kirstenbosch Botanical Garden in Capetown to ask him where he thought this remarkable plant came from  and his thought was that if you travel around Namibia  you see that there are a number of petrified forests  and the logs are all    the logs are all giant coniferous trees  and yet there's no sign of where they might have come from. So his thought was that flooding in the north of Africa actually brought those coniferous trees down tens of thousands of years ago  and what resulted was this remarkable adaptation to this unique desert environment. This is what I think is the most poetic of the oldest living things. This is something called an underground forest. So  I spoke to a botanist at the Pretoria Botanical Garden  who explained that certain species of trees have adapted to this region. It's bushfelt region  which is dry and prone to a lot of fires  as so what these trees have done is  if you can imagine that this is the crown of the tree  and that this is ground level  imagine that the whole thing  that whole bulk of the tree  migrated underground  and you just have those leaves peeping up above the surface. That way  when a fire roars through  it's the equivalent of getting your eyebrows singed. The tree can easily recover. These also tend to grow clonally  the oldest of which is        years old. Back in the U.S.  there's a couple plants of similar age. This is the clonal Creosote bush  which is around        years old. If you've been in the American West  you know the Creosote bush is pretty ubiquitous  but that being said  you see that this has this unique  circular form. And what's happening is it's expanding slowly outwards from that original shape. And it's one    again  that interconnected root system  making it one genetically identical individual. It also has a friend nearby    well  I think they're friends. This is the clonal Mojave yucca  it's about a mile away  and it's a little bit older than        years. And you see it has that similar circular form. And there's some younger clones dotting the landscape behind it. And both of these  the yucca and the Creosote bush  live on Bureau of Land Management land  and that's very different from being protected in a national park. In fact  this land is designated for recreational all terrain vehicle use. So  now I want to show what very well might be the oldest living thing on the planet. This is Siberian Actinobacteria  which is between         and         years old. This bacteria was discovered several years ago by a team of planetary biologists hoping to find clues to life on other planets by looking at one of the harshest conditions on ours. And what they found  by doing research into the permafrost  was this bacteria. But what's unique about it is that it's doing DNA repair below freezing. And what that means is that it's not dormant    it's actually been living and growing for half a million years. It's also probably one the most vulnerable of the oldest living things  because if the permafrost melts  it won't survive. This is a map that I've put together of the oldest living things  so you can get a sense of where they are  you see they're all over the world. The blue flags represent things that I've already photographed  and the reds are places that I'm still trying to get to. You'll see also  there's a flag on Antarctica. I'm trying to travel there to find       year old moss  which lives on the Antarctic Peninsula. So  I probably have about two more years left on this project    on this phase of the project  but after five years  I really feel like I know what's at the heart of this work. The oldest living things in the world are a record and celebration of our past  a call to action in the present and a barometer of our future. They've survived for millennia in desert  in the permafrost  at the tops of mountains and at the bottom of the ocean. They've withstood untold natural perils and human encroachments  but now some of them are in jeopardy  and they can't just get up and get out of the way. It's my hope that  by going to find these organisms  that I can help draw attention to their remarkable resilience and help play a part in insuring their continued longevity into the foreseeable future. Thank you. Well  that's kind of an obvious statement up there. I started with that sentence about    years ago  and I started in the context of developing countries  but you're sitting here from every corner of the world. So if you think of a map of your country  I think you'll realize that for every country on Earth  you could draw little circles to say   These are places where good teachers won't go.  On top of that  those are the places from where trouble comes. So we have an ironic problem    good teachers don't want to go to just those places where they're needed the most. I started in      to try and address this problem with an experiment  which was a very simple experiment in New Delhi. I basically embedded a computer into a wall of a slum in New Delhi. The children barely went to school  they didn't know any English    they'd never seen a computer before  and they didn't know what the internet was. I connected high speed internet to it    it's about three feet off the ground    turned it on and left it there. After this  we noticed a couple of interesting things  which you'll see. But I repeated this all over India and then through a large part of the world and noticed that children will learn to do what they want to learn to do. This is the first experiment that we did    eight year old boy on your right teaching his student  a six year old girl  and he was teaching her how to browse. This boy here in the middle of central India    this is in a Rajasthan village  where the children recorded their own music and then played it back to each other and in the process  they've enjoyed themselves thoroughly. They did all of this in four hours after seeing the computer for the first time. In another South Indian village  these boys here had assembled a video camera and were trying to take the photograph of a bumble bee. They downloaded it from Disney.com  or one of these websites     days after putting the computer in their village. So at the end of it  we concluded that groups of children can learn to use computers and the internet on their own  irrespective of who or where they were. At that point  I became a little more ambitious and decided to see what else could children do with a computer. We started off with an experiment in Hyderabad  India  where I gave a group of children    they spoke English with a very strong Telugu accent. I gave them a computer with a speech to text interface  which you now get free with Windows  and asked them to speak into it. So when they spoke into it  the computer typed out gibberish  so they said   Well  it doesn't understand anything of what we are saying.  So I said   Yeah  I'll leave it here for two months. Make yourself understood to the computer.  So the children said   How do we do that.  And I said   I don't know  actually.  And I left. Two months later    and this is now documented in the Information Technology for International Development journal    that accents had changed and were remarkably close to the neutral British accent in which I had trained the speech to text synthesizer. In other words  they were all speaking like James Tooley. So they could do that on their own. After that  I started to experiment with various other things that they might learn to do on their own. I got an interesting phone call once from Columbo  from the late Arthur C. Clarke  who said   I want to see what's going on.  And he couldn't travel  so I went over there. He said two interesting things   A teacher that can be replaced by a machine should be.  The second thing he said was that   If children have interest  then education happens.  And I was doing that in the field  so every time I would watch it and think of him. help people  because children quickly learn to navigate the web and find things which interest them. And when you've got interest  then you have education. Sugata Mitra  I took the experiment to South Africa. This is a    year old boy. like animals  and I listen to music. SM  And I asked him   Do you send emails   And he said   Yes  and they hop across the ocean.  This is in Cambodia  rural Cambodia    a fairly silly arithmetic game  which no child would play inside the classroom or at home. They would  you know  throw it back at you. They'd say   This is very boring.  If you leave it on the pavement and if all the adults go away  then they will show off with each other about what they can do. This is what these children are doing. They are trying to multiply  I think. And all over India  at the end of about two years  children were beginning to Google their homework. As a result  the teachers reported tremendous improvements in their English    rapid improvement and all sorts of things. They said   They have become really deep thinkers and so on and so forth. And indeed they had. I mean  if there's stuff on Google  why would you need to stuff it into your head  So at the end of the next four years  I decided that groups of children can navigate the internet to achieve educational objectives on their own. At that time  a large amount of money had come into Newcastle University to improve schooling in India. So Newcastle gave me a call. I said   I'll do it from Delhi.  They said   There's no way you're going to handle a million pounds worth of University money sitting in Delhi.  So in       I bought myself a heavy overcoat and moved to Newcastle. I wanted to test the limits of the system. The first experiment I did out of Newcastle was actually done in India. And I set myself and impossible target  can Tamil speaking    year old children in a South Indian village teach themselves biotechnology in English on their own  And I thought  I'll test them  they'll get a zero    I'll give the materials  I'll come back and test them    they get another zero  I'll go back and say   Yes  we need teachers for certain things.  I called in    children. They all came in there  and I told them that there's some really difficult stuff on this computer. I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't understand anything. It's all in English  and I'm going. So I left them with it. I came back after two months  and the    children marched in looking very  very quiet. I said   Well  did you look at any of the stuff   They said   Yes  we did.   Did you understand anything    No  nothing.  So I said   Well  how long did you practice on it before you decided you understood nothing   They said   We look at it every day.  So I said   For two months  you were looking at stuff you didn't understand   So a    year old girl raises her hand and says  literally   Apart from the fact that improper replication of the DNA molecule causes genetic disease  we've understood nothing else.  It took me three years to publish that. It's just been published in the British Journal of Educational Technology. One of the referees who refereed the paper said   It's too good to be true   which was not very nice. Well  one of the girls had taught herself to become the teacher. And then that's her over there. Remember  they don't study English. I edited out the last bit when I asked   Where is the neuron   and she says   The neuron  The neuron   and then she looked and did this. Whatever the expression  it was not very nice. So their scores had gone up from zero to    percent  which is an educational impossibility under the circumstances. But    percent is not a pass. So I found that they had a friend  a local accountant  a young girl  and they played football with her. I asked that girl   Would you teach them enough biotechnology to pass   And she said   How would I do that  I don't know the subject.  I said   No  use the method of the grandmother.  She said   What's that   I said   Well  what you've got to do is stand behind them and admire them all the time. Just say to them  'That's cool. That's fantastic. What is that  Can you do that again  Can you show me some more '  She did that for two months. The scores went up to     which is what the posh schools of New Delhi  with a trained biotechnology teacher were getting. So I came back to Newcastle with these results and decided that there was something happening here that definitely was getting very serious. So  having experimented in all sorts of remote places  I came to the most remote place that I could think of. Approximately       miles from Delhi is the little town of Gateshead. In Gateshead  I took    children and I started to fine tune the method. I made them into groups of four. I said   You make your own groups of four. Each group of four can use one computer and not four computers.  Remember  from the Hole in the Wall.  You can exchange groups. You can walk across to another group  if you don't like your group  etc. You can go to another group  peer over their shoulders  see what they're doing  come back to you own group and claim it as your own work.  And I explained to them that  you know  a lot of scientific research is done using that method. The children enthusiastically got after me and said   Now  what do you want us to do   I gave them six GCSE questions. The first group    the best one    solved everything in    minutes. The worst  in   . They used everything that they knew    news groups  Google  Wikipedia  Ask Jeeves  etc. The teachers said   Is this deep learning   I said   Well  let's try it. I'll come back after two months. We'll give them a paper test    no computers  no talking to each other  etc.  The average score when I'd done it with the computers and the groups was    percent. When I did the experiment  when I did the test  after two months  the score was    percent. There was photographic recall inside the children  I suspect because they're discussing with each other. A single child in front of a single computer will not do that. I have further results  which are almost unbelievable  of scores which go up with time. Because their teachers say that after the session is over  the children continue to Google further. Here in Britain  I put out a call for British grandmothers  after my Kuppam experiment. Well  you know  they're very vigorous people  British grandmothers.     of them volunteered immediately. The deal was that they would give me one hour of broadband time  sitting in their homes  one day in a week. So they did that  and over the last two years  over     hours of instruction has happened over Skype  using what my students call the granny cloud. The granny cloud sits over there. I can beam them to whichever school I want to. You say it. You can't catch me. Children  You can't catch me. Teacher  I'm the gingerbread man. Children  I'm the gingerbread man. Teacher  Well done. Very good ... SM  Back at Gateshead  a    year old girl gets into the heart of Hinduism in    minutes. You know  stuff which I don't know anything about. Two children watch a TEDTalk. They wanted to be footballers before. After watching eight TEDTalks  he wants to become Leonardo da Vinci. It's pretty simple stuff. This is what I'm building now    they're called SOLEs  Self Organized Learning Environments. The furniture is designed so that children can sit in front of big  powerful screens  big broadband connections  but in groups. If they want  they can call the granny cloud. This is a SOLE in Newcastle. The mediator is from Pune  India. So how far can we go  One last little bit and I'll stop. I went to Turin in May. I sent all the teachers away from my group of    year old students. I speak only English  they speak only Italian  so we had no way to communicate. I started writing English questions on the blackboard. The children looked at it and said   What   I said   Well  do it.  They typed it into Google  translated it into Italian  went back into Italian Google. Fifteen minutes later    next question  where is Calcutta  This one  they took only    minutes. I tried a really hard one then. Who was Pythagoras  and what did he do  There was silence for a while  then they said   You've spelled it wrong. It's Pitagora.  And then  in    minutes  the right angled triangles began to appear on the screens. This sent shivers up my spine. These are    year olds. Text  In another    minutes they would reach the Theory of Relativity. And then  SM  So you know what's happened  I think we've just stumbled across a self organizing system. A self organizing system is one where a structure appears without explicit intervention from the outside. Self organizing systems also always show emergence  which is that the system starts to do things  which it was never designed for. Which is why you react the way you do  because it looks impossible. I think I can make a guess now    education is self organizing system  where learning is an emergent phenomenon. It'll take a few years to prove it  experimentally  but I'm going to try. But in the meanwhile  there is a method available. One billion children  we need     million mediators    there are many more than that on the planet       million SOLEs      billion dollars and    years. We could change everything. Thanks. The moment I say  school   so many memories come back to me. It's like after every exam  when I walk out  the teacher would say   Hey  come. How did you do   I would say with a great smile   I will definitely pass.  And I didn't understand why  in one hand they say   Speak the truth   in the other hand  when you say the truth  they hated you. So it went on like that  and I didn't know where else to find myself. So I remember those nights I used to go to sleep with asking help from  the  Unknown because  for some reason  I couldn't believe what my father and mother hanged in the Puja room as a god  because my friend's family had something else as a god. So I thought   I guess I'll pray to  the  Unknown and ask help   and started getting help from everywhere  each and every corner of my life at that time. My brothers started giving me a few tips about drawing and painting. Then  when I was in eighth standard around    years old  I started working in a part time job in one of the signboard artists called Putu. And then school also started supporting me.  Oh  he's bad at studies  but let him send to the drawing competitions.  So it was good to survive with that little tool that I found to find my own place in school. And one of those competitions  I just won a small  little transistor Philips radio. And I didn't have the patience to wait until I reached home. So I just switched on in the train  loudly. If you travel in Indian trains  you can see people listening to radio and  you know  even from their mobiles. So at that time    and I was       and I was listening to just radio  and someone happened to sit next to me  like these three people are sitting here. You know  like just adjacent to me. He just started asking   Where did you buy the radio  How much is it   I said   It's a prize from  an  art competition.  And he said   Oh  I teach at a college of arts. I think you should study in a school of art. You just quit school and come there.  So  why I'm telling you this  you know  maybe  you know  whoever is sitting next to you can change your whole life    it's possible. It is that we need we need to be open and fine tuned. So that's what made me enter  the  college of arts after three attempts and just continue to inquire what I really want to do with art work  or art and finally I'm here in front of you. When I look back  you know  on what happened between that time and now here    the last       years    I can see that most of the works revolve around three subjects  but it was not intentional. And I just start out with a trace because I was thinking   What really makes us      you know  it's actually  the  past  what makes a person. So I was thinking  but when you look at the past  the way to understand the past is only by the traces available  because we cannot go back  to  the past. It can be ruins  or it can be music  or it can be painting or drawing or writing  whatever it is. But it is just a kind of trace of that time. And that fascinated me  to explore that territory. So I was working on the line  but instead of working about traces  I started capturing traces. So here are some of the works I would like to show you. So this is called  Self In Progress.  It's just a trace of being in this body. So here  what happened then  you know    what I really enjoyed the most is that this sculpture is nothing but a trace of myself. It's almost like a  D photograph. So there is an element of performance  and there is an element of sculpture  and there is an element of feeling one's self  so close to one's self. So it's almost like fossils for the future. And then moved slowly to explore the other possibilities of capturing traces. So this is what I was talking about  while molding  it's such a great experience  because we have freedom of like walking  or moving my hand or  moving around in the space  but the moment this becomes solid  when you cannot move even an inch  because this is plaster of Paris  so the moment you pour it it's like liquid  but after    minutes  it's almost like a hard stone. So this is capturing the trace of a thumbprint because  knowingly or unknowingly  whatever we do  you know  we leave our traces here. So I just thought   I'm going to capture thumbprint  footprint  or whatever traces we leave as humans.  This is the trace of fire  this is the trace of sun. Because when I was capturing traces  you know  this thought comes to me always  is it  only when the object touches the thing and it leaves the trace  or is there other ways to capture it   So this work is nothing but like    because of the focal length of the lens  it just shows what is on the other side. So I just put the paper on the focal length  which was an etching print  then I got the portrait of  the  sun from sunlight. This is called  Dawn to Dawn.  What I did here  I just put like    feet  of  paper then put a coconut rope  and just burnt it. So it took about    hours to get this line. So wherever the fire is eating the paper  that's what becomes the work    detail. Even though we have traces when we try to understand them  the perception and context play a major role to understand it. So do we really understand what it is  or are we trying to get what we think it is  Then move towards questioning the perception because  even though there are traces  when you try to understand them  you know you play a major role. So like let's say even a simple act. How many of you saw a cow crossing in India while you were coming from Bangalore to Mysore  Can you just raise the hand  If you just ask an opinion of how  everyone can interpret it. Like  let's say  if a schoolteacher says  she'll simply say   To get to the other side.  Why the cow was crossing the road  you know. The answer can be so different if Potter said it. He would say   For the greater good.  Martin Luther King would say   I imagine a world where all cows will be free to cross the road  without having their motives called into question.  Imagine Moses comes now  and he sees the same cow walking around the street. He would definitely say   God came down from heaven  and he said unto the cow  'Thou shalt cross the road.' And cow crossed the road  and there was much rejoicing as a holy cow.  Freud would say   The fact that you're at all concerned reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.  If we ask Einstein  he would say   Whether the cow crossed the road  or the road moved underneath the cow  depends on your frame of reference.  Or Buddha    if he saw the same cow  he would say   Asking this question denies your own nature  as a  cow.  So  what we see is just what we think often  and most of the time  we don't see what it is. It just all depends on one's perception. And context  what is really context  You know  I could just show you this little piece of paper. Because I always think meaning doesn't really exist. The meaning of what we create in this world doesn't exist. It's just created by the mind. If you look at this piece of paper  this is the breadth and this is called length. This is how we've been taught in school. But if you tear it in the middle    now  I didn't touch this breadth  but still  the meaning of this changes. So what we conceive as a meaning is always not there  it's on the other side  even when we say dark  light  good  bad  tall  short    all meaning it doesn't exist in reality. It's just that being a human  the way we train to perceive the reality creates this meaning. So this work from this period is mostly like    you know  this is a work called  Light Makes Dark.  It's just captured through from the lamp. So the lamp is not just giving a light  it's also giving a darkness. So this is a work of art  which is just trying to explore that. This is called  Limit Out.  This shows how limited our eye or hearing sense or touch    do we really see  This is an exact negative. It's about six inches deep in the wall  but it just appears like it's coming out of the wall. You know the wall is almost like    this is the first skin  and this is the second  and there's a third  and each creates a meaning. And we're just pulling the wall off the gallery. Again   Inward Out.  It's a full figure cast from myself. It's about eight inches deep. When I was doing that  I always wondered since I've worked with creators    and now you know  I've moved to questioning the perception    whenever I see the bird flying in the sky  it just makes me feel like  is there anything behind  are there any traces up there  which as a human  we don't see them  Is there any way to capture the thought into visual art  I couldn't find it. But a solution arrived after being quiet and not working for about six  seven months  in the restroom  when I was changing the air freshener that goes from solid substance to vapor. It's called Odonil. This is the work I made out of that material. The process to get to make the sculpture was interesting  because I wrote to Balsara  who produces that air freshener called Odonil  saying   Dear Sir  I am an artist. This is my catalogue. Will you help me to make this sculpture   They never wrote back to me. Then I thought   I will go to the Small Scale Industries Facilitating Unit and ask help.  So I told them   I'd like to start an air freshener company.  They said   Of course. This is the fee for the project report  and we will give you all the details   and they gave. Finally  I went back to them and said   It's not for starting the company  it's just to make my own work. Please come for the show.  And they did. And this work is in the Devi Art Foundation in Delhi. In India  nobody really talks about works of art  they always talk about the appreciation of art. You buy this for       rupees  it'll become        in two months. This is the craft that was going on  but there are a few collectors who also collect art which can depreciate. And this was collected by Anupam    which is like  finally in the end  he will not have anything  because it will evaporate. So this is after a few weeks  this is after a few months. It's just all about questioning the preconceptions. So if someone says   Oh  I see the portrait   it may not be the portrait after a few months. And if they say it's solid  it will not be solid  it will evaporate. And if they say they don't get it  that's also not true  because it's in the air. It's in the same gallery or in the same museum. So they inhaled it  but they are not aware of it. While I was doing that work  my mom and my dad  they were looking at it and they said   Why do you deal with negative subjects all the time   And I was like   What do you mean    Light makes dark and now evaporating self. Don't you think it remained something about death   they said.  Of course not. For me   I'm thinking   this is tucked in some small solid  but the moment it evaporates  it's merged with the whole.  But she said   No. Still  I don't like it. Can you make something from nothing as a sculptor   I said   No  mom. It can't be. Because we can create a sculpture by gathering dust together  or we can break the sculpture and get the dust  but there is nowhere that we can bring dust into the universe.  So  I did this work for her. It's called  Emerging Angel.  This is the first day    it just gives the appearance that one is becoming the other. So  the same sculpture after a few days. This is after       days. Through that small little slit between the glass box and the wood  the air goes underneath the sculpture and creates the other one. This gave me a greater faith. That evaporating sculpture gave me a greater faith that maybe there is many more possibilities to capture  the  invisible. So what you see now is called  Shadow Foreshadow.  And what I'd like to tell you is we don't see shadow  and we don't see light too  we see the source of the light. We see where it's bouncing  but we don't see  them  as they exist. You know  that's why the night sky  we see the sky as dark  but it's filled with light all the time. When it's bounced on the moon  we see it. The same thing in the darkroom. The little dust particle will again  reflect the light  and we realize the existence of light. So we don't see dark  we don't see light  we don't see gravity  we don't see electricity. So  I just started doing this work to inquire further about how to sculpt the space between this object and there. Because  as a visual artist  if I'm seeing this and I'm seeing that    but how to sculpt this  you know  If we sculpt this  this has two reference points. The skin of this is also representing this. And skin at the other end also represents the floor. I did this as an experiment of casting the shadow. So this is a corrugated box and its shadow. Then the second one    the moment you bring any invisible into the visible world it will have all the characteristics of the visible existence. So that produced a shadow. Then I thought  okay  let me sculpt that. Then  again  that becomes an object. Again  throwing light  then the third one. So what you see is nothing but shadow of a shadow of a shadow. And then again  at that point  there is no shadow. I thought   Oh  good. Work is finished.  You can see the detail. This is called  Gravity.  It's called  Breath.  It's just two holes on the gallery wall. It's a false wall  which contains like     cubic feet. So that hole actually makes the air come out and go in. So where it's happening  we can see  but what is happening will remain invisible only. This is from the show called  Invisible   at Talwar Gallery. This is called  Kaayam.  Detail. And what I'd like to tell you  our senses are so limited    we cannot hear everything  we cannot see everything. We don't feel   I am touching the air   but if the breeze is a little more faster  then I can feel it. So all of our construction of reality is through these limited senses. So my request was like  is there any way to use all this as just a symbol or a sign  And to really get to the point  we should move beyond  you know  go to the other side of the wall  like illogic  like are invisible. Because when we see someone walks  we see the footprint. But if we're just cutting that footprint from the whole thing and trying to analyze it  you will miss the point because the actual journey happens between those footprints  and the footprints are nothing but passing time. Thank you. My story is a little bit about war. It's about disillusionment. It's about death. And it's about rediscovering idealism in all of that wreckage. And perhaps also  there's a lesson about how to deal with our screwed up  fragmenting and dangerous world of the   st century. I don't believe in straightforward narratives. I don't believe in a life or history written as decision  A  led to consequence  B  led to consequence  C     these neat narratives that we're presented with  and that perhaps we encourage in each other. I believe in randomness  and one of the reasons I believe that is because me becoming a diplomat was random. I'm colorblind. I was born unable to see most colors. This is why I wear gray and black most of the time  and I have to take my wife with me to chose clothes. And I'd always wanted to be a fighter pilot when I was a boy. I loved watching planes barrel over our holiday home in the countryside. And it was my boyhood dream to be a fighter pilot. And I did the tests in the Royal Air Force to become a pilot  and sure enough  I failed. I couldn't see all the blinking different lights  and I can't distinguish color. So I had to choose another career  and this was in fact relatively easy for me  because I had an abiding passion all the way through my childhood  which was international relations. As a child  I read the newspaper thoroughly. I was fascinated by the Cold War  by the INF negotiations over intermediate range nuclear missiles  the proxy war between the Soviet Union and the U.S. in Angola or Afghanistan. These things really interested me. And so I decided quite at an early age I wanted to be a diplomat. And I  one day  I announced this to my parents    and my father denies this story to this day    I said   Daddy  I want to be a diplomat.  And he turned to me  and he said   Carne  you have to be very clever to be a diplomat.  And my ambition was sealed. In       I entered the British Foreign Service. That year        people applied to become a diplomat  and    of us succeeded. And as those numbers suggest  I was inducted into an elite and fascinating and exhilarating world. Being a diplomat  then and now  is an incredible job  and I loved every minute of it    I enjoyed the status of it. I bought myself a nice suit and wore leather soled shoes and reveled in this amazing access I had to world events. I traveled to the Gaza Strip. I headed the Middle East Peace Process section in the British Foreign Ministry. I became a speechwriter for the British Foreign Secretary. I met Yasser Arafat. I negotiated with Saddam's diplomats at the U.N. Later  I traveled to Kabul and served in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban. And I would travel in a C     transport and go and visit warlords in mountain hideaways and negotiate with them about how we were going to eradicate Al Qaeda from Afghanistan  surrounded by my Special Forces escort  who  themselves  had to have an escort of a platoon of Royal Marines  because it was so dangerous. And that was exciting    that was fun. It was really interesting. And it's a great cadre of people  incredibly close knit community of people. And the pinnacle of my career  as it turned out  was when I was posted to New York. I'd already served in Germany  Norway  various other places  but I was posted to New York to serve on the U.N. Security Council for the British delegation. And my responsibility was the Middle East  which was my specialty. And there  I dealt with things like the Middle East peace process  the Lockerbie issue    we can talk about that later  if you wish    but above all  my responsibility was Iraq and its weapons of mass destruction and the sanctions we placed on Iraq to oblige it to disarm itself of these weapons. I was the chief British negotiator on the subject  and I was steeped in the issue. And anyway  my tour    it was kind of a very exciting time. I mean it was very dramatic diplomacy. We went through several wars during my time in New York. I negotiated for my country the resolution in the Security Council of the   th of September      condemning the attacks of the day before  which were  of course  deeply present to us actually living in New York at the time. So it was kind of the best of time  worst of times kind of experience. I lived the high life. Although I worked very long hours  I lived in a penthouse in Union Square. I was a single British diplomat in New York City  you can imagine what that might have meant. I had a good time. But in       when my tour came to an end  I decided I wasn't going to go back to the job that was waiting for me in London. I decided to take a sabbatical  in fact  at the New School  Bruce. In some inchoate  inarticulate way I realized that there was something wrong with my work  with me. I was exhausted  and I was also disillusioned in a way I couldn't quite put my finger on. And I decided to take some time out from work. The Foreign Office was very generous. You could take these special unpaid leave  as they called them  and yet remain part of the diplomatic service  but not actually do any work. It was nice. And eventually  I decided to take a secondment to join the U.N. in Kosovo  which was then under U.N. administration. And two things happened in Kosovo  which kind of  again  shows the randomness of life  because these things turned out to be two of the pivots of my life and helped to deliver me to the next stage. But they were random things. One was that  in the summer of       the British government  somewhat reluctantly  decided to have an official inquiry into the use of intelligence on WMD in the run up to the Iraq War  a very limited subject. And I testified to that inquiry in secret. I had been steeped in the intelligence on Iraq and its WMD  and my testimony to the inquiry said three things  that the government exaggerated the intelligence  which was very clear in all the years I'd read it. And indeed  our own internal assessment was very clear that Iraq's WMD did not pose a threat to its neighbors  let alone to us. Secondly  the government had ignored all available alternatives to war  which in some ways was a more discreditable thing still. The third reason  I won't go into. But anyway  I gave that testimony  and that presented me with a crisis. What was I going to do  This testimony was deeply critical of my colleagues  of my ministers  who had  in my view had perpetrated a war on a falsehood. And so I was in crisis. And this wasn't a pretty thing. I moaned about it  I hesitated  I went on and on and on to my long suffering wife  and eventually I decided to resign from the British Foreign Service. I felt    there's a scene in the Al Pacino movie  The Insider   which you may know  where he goes back to CBS after they've let him down over the tobacco guy  and he goes   You know  I just can't do this anymore. Something's broken.  And it was like that for me. I love that movie. I felt just something's broken. I can't actually sit with my foreign minister or my prime minister again with a smile on my face and do what I used to do gladly for them. So took a running leap and jumped over the edge of a cliff. And it was a very  very uncomfortable  unpleasant feeling. And I started to fall. And today  that fall hasn't stopped  I'm still falling. But  in a way  I've got used to the sensation of it. And in a way  I kind of like the sensation of it a lot better than I like actually standing on top of the cliff  wondering what to do. A second thing happened in Kosovo  which kind of    I need a quick gulp of water  forgive me. A second thing happened in Kosovo  which kind of delivered the answer  which I couldn't really answer  which is   What do I do with my life   I love diplomacy    I have no career    I expected my entire life to be a diplomat  to be serving my country. I wanted to be an ambassador  and my mentors  my heroes  people who got to the top of my profession  and here I was throwing it all away. A lot of my friends were still in it. My pension was in it. And I gave it up. And what was I going to do  And that year  in Kosovo  this terrible  terrible thing happened  which I saw. In March       there were terrible riots all over the province    as it then was    of Kosovo.    people were killed. It was anarchy. And it's a very horrible thing to see anarchy  to know that the police and the military    there were lots of military troops there    actually can't stop that rampaging mob who's coming down the street. And the only way that rampaging mob coming down the street will stop is when they decide to stop and when they've had enough burning and killing. And that is not a very nice feeling to see  and I saw it. And I went through it. I went through those mobs. And with my Albanian friends  we tried to stop it  but we failed. And that riot taught me something  which isn't immediately obvious and it's kind of a complicated story. But one of the reasons that riot took place    those riots  which went on for several days  took place    was because the Kosovo people were disenfranchised from their own future. There were diplomatic negotiations about the future of Kosovo going on then  and the Kosovo government  let alone the Kosovo people  were not actually participating in those talks. There was this whole fancy diplomatic system  this negotiation process about the future of Kosovo  and the Kosovars weren't part of it. And funnily enough  they were frustrated about that. Those riots were part of the manifestation of that frustration. It wasn't the only reason  and life is not simple  one reason narratives. It was a complicated thing  and I'm not pretending it was more simple than it was. But that was one of the reasons. And that kind of gave me the inspiration    or rather to be precise  it gave my wife the inspiration. She said   Why don't you advise the Kosovars  Why don't you advise their government on their diplomacy   And the Kosovars were not allowed a diplomatic service. They were not allowed diplomats. They were not allowed a foreign office to help them deal with this immensely complicated process  which became known as the Final Status Process of Kosovo. And so that was the idea. That was the origin of the thing that became Independent Diplomat  the world's first diplomatic advisory group and a non profit to boot. And it began when I flew back from London after my time at the U.N. in Kosovo. I flew back and had dinner with the Kosovo prime minister and said to him   Look  I'm proposing that I come and advise you on the diplomacy. I know this stuff. It's what I do. Why don't I come and help you   And he raised his glass of raki to me and said   Yes  Carne. Come.  And I came to Kosovo and advised the Kosovo government. Independent Diplomat ended up advising three successive Kosovo prime ministers and the multi party negotiation team of Kosovo. And Kosovo became independent. Independent Diplomat is now established in five diplomatic centers around the world  and we're advising seven or eight different countries  or political groups  depending on how you wish to define them    and I'm not big on definitions. We're advising the Northern Cypriots on how to reunify their island. We're advising the Burmese opposition  the government of Southern Sudan  which    you heard it here first    is going to be a new country within the next few years. We're advising the Polisario Front of the Western Sahara  who are fighting to get their country back from Moroccan occupation after    years of dispossession. We're advising various island states in the climate change negotiations  which is suppose to culminate in Copenhagen. There's a bit of randomness here too because  when I was beginning Independent Diplomat  I went to a party in the House of Lords  which is a ridiculous place  but I was holding my drink like this  and I bumped into this guy who was standing behind me. And we started talking  and he said    I told him what I was doing  and I told him rather grandly I was going to establish Independent Diplomat in New York. At that time there was just me    and me and my wife were moving back to New York. And he said   Why don't you see my colleagues in New York   And it turned out he worked for an innovation company called  What If   which some of you have probably heard of. And one thing led to another  and I ended up having a desk in  What If  in New York  when I started Independent Diplomat. And watching  What If  develop new flavors of chewing gum for Wrigley or new flavors for Coke actually helped me innovate new strategies for the Kosovars and for the Saharawis of the Western Sahara. And I began to realize that there are different ways of doing diplomacy    that diplomacy  like business  is a business of solving problems  and yet the word innovation doesn't exist in diplomacy  it's all zero sum games and realpolitik and ancient institutions that have been there for generations and do things the same way they've always done things. And Independent Diplomat  today  tries to incorporate some of the things I learned at  What If . We all sit in one office and shout at each other across the office. We all work on little laptops and try to move desks to change the way we think. And we use naive experts who may know nothing about the countries we're dealing with  but may know something about something else to try to inject new thinking into the problems that we try to address for our clients. It's not easy  because our clients  by definition  are having a difficult time  diplomatically. There are  I don't know  some lessons from all of this  personal and political    and in a way  they're the same thing. The personal one is falling off a cliff is actually a good thing  and I recommend it. And it's a good thing to do at least once in your life just to tear everything up and jump. The second thing is a bigger lesson about the world today. Independent Diplomat is part of a trend which is emerging and evident across the world  which is that the world is fragmenting. States mean less than they used to  and the power of the state is declining. That means the power of others things is rising. Those other things are called non state actors. They may be corporations  they may be mafiosi  they may be nice NGOs  they may anything  any number of things. We are living in a more complicated and fragmented world. If governments are less able to affect the problems that affect us in the world  then that means  who is left to deal with them  who has to take greater responsibility to deal with them  Us. If they can't do it  who's left to deal with it  We have no choice but to embrace that reality. What this means is it's no longer good enough to say that international relations  or global affairs  or chaos in Somalia  or what's going on in Burma is none of your business  and that you can leave it to governments to get on with. I can connect any one of you by six degrees of separation to the Al Shabaab militia in Somalia. Ask me how later  particularly if you eat fish  interestingly enough  but that connection is there. We are all intimately connected. And this isn't just Tom Friedman  it's actually provable in case after case after case. What that means is  instead of asking your politicians to do things  you have to look to yourself to do things. And Independent Diplomat is a kind of example of this in a sort of loose way. There aren't neat examples  but one example is this  the way the world is changing is embodied in what's going on at the place I used to work    the U.N. Security Council. The U.N. was established in     . Its charter is basically designed to stop conflicts between states    interstate conflict. Today     percent of the agenda of the U.N. Security Council is about conflicts within states  involving non state parties    guerillas  separatists  terrorists  if you want to call them that  people who are not normal governments  who are not normal states. That is the state of the world today. When I realized this  and when I look back on my time at the Security Council and what happened with the Kosovars  and I realize that often the people who were most directly affected by what we were doing in the Security Council weren't actually there  weren't actually invited to give their views to the Security Council  I thought  this is wrong. Something's got to be done about this. So I started off in a traditional mode. Me and my colleagues at Independent Diplomat went around the U.N. Security Council. We went around    U.N. member states    the Kazaks  the Ethiopians  the Israelis    you name them  we went to see them    the secretary general  all of them  and said   This is all wrong. This is terrible that you don't consult these people who are actually affected. You've got to institutionalize a system where you actually invite the Kosovars to come and tell you what they think. This will allow you to tell me    you can tell them what you think. It'll be great. You can have an exchange. You can actually incorporate these people's views into your decisions  which means your decisions will be more effective and durable.  Super logical  you would think. I mean  incredibly logical. So obvious  anybody could get it. And of course  everybody got it. Everybody went   Yes  of course  you're absolutely right. Come back to us in maybe six months.  And of course  nothing happened    nobody did anything. The Security Council does its business in exactly the same way today that it did X number of years ago  when I was there    years ago. So we looked at that observation of basically failure and thought  what can we do about it. And I thought  I'm buggered if I'm going to spend the rest of my life lobbying for these crummy governments to do what needs to be done. So what we're going to do is we're actually going to set up these meetings ourselves. So now  Independent Diplomat is in the process of setting up meetings between the U.N. Security Council and the parties to the disputes that are on the agenda of the Security Council. So we will be bringing Darfuri rebel groups  the Northern Cypriots and the Southern Cypriots  rebels from Aceh  and awful long laundry list of chaotic conflicts around the world. And we will be trying to bring the parties to New York to sit down in a quiet room in a private setting with no press and actually explain what they want to the members of the U. N. Security Council  and for the members of the U.N. Security Council to explain to them what they want. So there's actually a conversation  which has never before happened. And of course  describing all this  any of you who know politics will think this is incredibly difficult  and I entirely agree with you. The chances of failure are very high  but it certainly won't happen if we don't try to make it happen. And my politics has changed fundamentally from when I was a diplomat to what I am today  and I think that outputs is what matters  not process  not technology  frankly  so much either. Preach technology to all the Twittering members of all the Iranian demonstrations who are now in political prison in Tehran  where Ahmadinejad remains in power. Technology has not delivered political change in Iran. You've got to look at the outputs  and you got to say to yourself   What can I do to produce that particular output   That is the politics of the   st century  and in a way  Independent Diplomat embodies that fragmentation  that change  that is happening to all of us. That's my story. Thanks. I am a cultural omnivore  one whose daily commute is made possible by attachment to an iPod    an iPod that contains Wagner and Mozart  pop diva Christina Aguilera  country singer Josh Turner  gangsta rap artist Kirk Franklin  concerti  symphonies and more and more. I'm a voracious reader  a reader who deals with Ian McEwan down to Stephanie Meyer. I have read the  Twilight  tetralogy. And one who lives for my home theater  a home theater where I devour DVDs  video on demand and a lot of television. For me   Law and Order  SVU   Tine Fey and     Rock  and  Judge Judy      The people are real  the cases are real  the rulings are final.  Now  I'm convinced a lot of you probably share my passions  especially my passion for Judge Judy  and you'd fight anybody who attempted to take her away from us  but I'm a little less convinced that you share the central passion of my life  a passion for the live professional performing arts  performing arts that represent the orchestral repertoire  yes  but jazz as well  modern dance  opera  theater and more and more and more. You know  frankly it's a sector that many of us who work in the field worry is being endangered and possibly dismantled by technology. While we initially heralded the Internet as the fantastic new marketing device that was going to solve all our problems  we now realize that the Internet is  if anything  too effective in that regard. Depending on who you read  an arts organization or an artist  who tries to attract the attention of a potential single ticket buyer  now competes with between three and       different marketing messages a typical citizen sees every single day. We now know in fact that technology is our biggest competitor for leisure time. Five years ago  Gen X'ers spent   .  hours online and TV  the majority on TV. Gen Y'ers spent even more      .  hours  the majority online. And now  a typical university entering student arrives at college already having spent        hours online and an additional        hours playing video games    a stark reminder that we operate in a cultural context where video games now outsell music and movie recordings combined. Moreover  we're afraid that technology has altered our very assumptions of cultural consumption. Thanks to the Internet  we believe we can get anything we want whenever we want it  delivered to our own doorstep. We can shop at three in the morning or eight at night  ordering jeans tailor made for our unique body types. Expectations of personalization and customization that the live performing arts    which have set curtain times  set venues  attendant inconveniences of travel  parking and the like    simply cannot meet. And we're all acutely aware  what's it going to mean in the future when we ask someone to pay a hundred dollars for a symphony  opera or ballet ticket  when that cultural consumer is used to downloading on the internet    hours a day for    cents a song or for free  These are enormous questions for those of us who work in this terrain. But as particular as they feel to us  we know we're not alone. All of us are engaged in a seismic  fundamental realignment of culture and communications  a realignment that is shaking and decimating the newspaper industry  the magazine industry  the book and publishing industry and more. Saddled in the performing arts as we are  by antiquated union agreements that inhibit and often prohibit mechanical reproduction and streaming  locked into large facilities that were designed to ossify the ideal relationship between artist and audience most appropriate to the   th century and locked into a business model dependent on high ticket revenues  where we charge exorbitant prices. Many of us shudder in the wake of the collapse of Tower Records and ask ourselves   Are we next   Everyone I talk to in performing arts resonates to the words of Adrienne Rich  who  in  Dreams of a Common Language   wrote   We are out in a country that has no language  no laws. Whatever we do together is pure invention. The maps they gave us are out of date by years.  And for those of you who love the arts  aren't you glad you invited me here to brighten your day  Now  rather than saying that we're on the brink of our own annihilation  I prefer to believe that we are engaged in a fundamental reformation  a reformation like the religious Reformation of the   th century. The arts reformation  like the religious Reformation  is spurred in part by technology  with indeed  the printing press really leading the charge on the religious Reformation. Both reformations were predicated on fractious discussion  internal self doubt and massive realignment of antiquated business models. And at heart  both reformations  I think were asking the questions  who's entitled to practice  How are they entitled to practice  And indeed  do we need anyone to intermediate for us in order to have an experience with a spiritual divine  Chris Anderson  someone I trust you all know  editor in chief of Wired magazine and author of  The Long Tail   really was the first    for me    to nail a lot of this. He wrote a long time ago  you know  thanks to the invention of the Internet  web technology  mini cams and more  the means of artistic production have been democratized for the first time in all of human history. In the     s  if any of you wanted to make a movie  you had to work for Warner Brothers or RKO because who could afford a movie set and lighting equipment and editing equipment and scoring and more  And now who in this room doesn't know a    year old hard at work on her second  third  or fourth movie  Similarly  the means of artistic distribution have been democratized for the first time in human history. Again  in the '  s  Warner Brothers  RKO did that for you. Now  go to YouTube  Facebook  you have worldwide distribution without leaving the privacy of your own bedroom. This double impact is occasioning a massive redefinition of the cultural market  a time when anyone is a potential author. Frankly  what we're seeing now in this environment is a massive time  when the entire world is changing as we move from a time when audience numbers are plummeting. But the number of arts participants  people who write poetry  who sing songs  who perform in church choirs  is exploding beyond our wildest imaginations. This group  others have called the  pro ams   amateur artists doing work at a professional level. You see them on YouTube  in dance competitions  film festivals and more. They are radically expanding our notions of the potential of an aesthetic vocabulary  while they are challenging and undermining the cultural autonomy of our traditional institutions. Ultimately  we now live in a world defined not by consumption  but by participation. But I want to be clear  just as the religious Reformation did not spell the end to the formal Church or to the priesthood  I believe that our artistic institutions will continue to have importance. They currently are the best opportunities for artists to have lives of economic dignity    not opulence    of dignity. And they are the places where artists who deserve and want to work at a certain scale of resources will find a home. But to view them as synonymous with the entirety of the arts community is  by far  too short sighted. And indeed  while we've tended to polarize the amateur from the professional  the single most exciting development in the last five to    years has been the rise of the professional hybrid artist  the professional artist who works  not primarily in the concert hall or on the stage  but most frequently around women's rights  or human rights  or on global warming issues or AIDS relief for more    not out of economic necessity  but out of a deep  organic conviction that the work that she or he  is called to do cannot be accomplished in the traditional hermetic arts environment. Today's dance world is not defined solely by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet or the National Ballet of Canada  but by Liz Lerman's Dance Exchange    a multi generational  professional dance company  whose dancers range in age from    to     and who work with genomic scientists to embody the DNA strand and with nuclear physicists at CERN. Today's professional theater community is defined  not only the Shaw and Stratford Festivals  but by the Cornerstone Theater of Los Angeles    a collective of artists that after       brought together    different religious communities    the Bahia  the Catholic  the Muslim  the Jewish  even the Native American and the gay and lesbian communities of faith  helping them create their own individual plays and one massive play  where they explored the differences in their faith and found commonality as an important first step toward cross community healing. Today's performers  like Rhodessa Jones  work in women's prisons  helping women prisoners articulate the pain of incarceration  while today's playwrights and directors work with youth gangs to find alternate channels to violence and more and more and more. And indeed  I think  rather than being annihilated  the performing arts are posed on the brink of a time when we will be more important than we have ever been. You know  we've said for a long time  we are critical to the health of the economic communities in your town. And absolutely    I hope you know that every dollar spent on a performing arts ticket in a community generates five to seven additional dollars for the local economy  dollars spent in restaurants or on parking  at the fabric stores where we buy fabric for costumes  the piano tuner who tunes the instruments and more. But the arts are going to be more important to economies as we go forward  especially in industries we can't even imagine yet  just as they have been central to the iPod and the computer game industries  which few  if any of us come have foreseen    to    years ago. Business leadership will depend more and more on emotional intelligence  the ability to listen deeply  to have empathy  to articulate change  to motivate others    the very capacities that the arts cultivate with every encounter. Especially now  as we all must confront the fallacy of a market only orientation  uninformed by social conscience  we must seize and celebrate the power of the arts to shape our individual and national characters  and especially characters of the young people  who all too often  are subjected to bombardment of sensation  rather than digested experience. Ultimately  especially now in this world  where we live in a context of regressive and onerous immigration laws  in reality TV that thrives on humiliation  and in a context of analysis  where the thing we hear most repeatedly  day in  day out in the United States  in every train station  every bus station  every plane station is   Ladies and gentlemen  please report any suspicious behavior or suspicious individuals to the authorities nearest you   when all of these ways we are encouraged to view our fellow human being with hostility and fear and contempt and suspicion. The arts  whatever they do  whenever they call us together  invite us to look at our fellow human being with generosity and curiosity. God knows  if we ever needed that capacity in human history  we need it now. You know  we're bound together  not  I think by technology  entertainment and design  but by common cause. We work to promote healthy vibrant societies  to ameliorate human suffering  to promote a more thoughtful  substantive  empathic world order. I salute all of you as activists in that quest and urge you to embrace and hold dear the arts in your work  whatever your purpose may be. I promise you the hand of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation is stretched out in friendship for now and years to come. And I thank you for your kindness and your patience in listening to me this afternoon. Thank you  and godspeed. If you really want to understand the problem that we're facing with the oceans  you have to think about the biology at the same time you think about the physics. We can't solve the problems unless we start studying the ocean in a very much more interdisciplinary way. So I'm going to demonstrate that through discussion of some of the climate change things that are going on in the ocean. We'll look at sea level rise. We'll look at ocean warming. And then the last thing on the list there  ocean acidification    if you were to ask me  you know   What do you worry about the most  What frightens you   for me  it's ocean acidification. And this has come onto the stage pretty recently. So I will spend a little time at the end. I was in Copenhagen in December like a number of you in this room. And I think we all found it  simultaneously  an eye opening and a very frustrating experience. I sat in this large negotiation hall  at one point  for three or four hours  without hearing the word  oceans  one time. It really wasn't on the radar screen. The nations that brought it up when we had the speeches of the national leaders    it tended to be the leaders of the small island states  the low lying island states. And by this weird quirk of alphabetical order of the nations  a lot of the low lying states  like Kiribati and Nauru  they were seated at the very end of these immensely long rows. You know  they were marginalized in the negotiation room. One of the problems is coming up with the right target. It's not clear what the target should be. And how can you figure out how to fix something if you don't have a clear target  Now  you've heard about  two degrees   that we should limit temperature rise to no more than two degrees. But there's not a lot of science behind that number. We've also talked about concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Should it be      Should it be      There's not a lot of science behind that one either. Most of the science that is behind these numbers  these potential targets  is based on studies on land. And I would say  for the people that work in the ocean and think about what the targets should be  we would argue that they must be much lower. You know  from an oceanic perspective      is way too high. Now there's compelling evidence that it really needs to be    . We are  right now  at     parts per million of CO  in the atmosphere. We're not going to put the brakes on in time to stop at      so we've got to accept we're going to do an overshoot  and the discussion as we go forward has to focus on how far the overshoot goes and what's the pathway back to    . Now  why is this so complicated  Why don't we know some of these things a little bit better  Well  the problem is that we've got very complicated forces in the climate system. There's all kinds of natural causes of climate change. There's air sea interactions. Here in Galapagos  we're affected by El Ninos and La Nina. But the entire planet warms up when there's a big El Nino. Volcanoes eject aerosols into the atmosphere. That changes our climate. The ocean contains most of the exchangeable heat on the planet. So anything that influences how ocean surface waters mix with the deep water changes the ocean of the planet. And we know the solar output's not constant through time. So those are all natural causes of climate change. And then we have the human induced causes of climate change as well. We're changing the characteristics of the surface of the land  the reflectivity. We inject our own aerosols into the atmosphere  and we have trace gases  and not just carbon dioxide    it's methane  ozone  oxides of sulfur and nitrogen. So here's the thing. It sounds like a simple question. Is CO  produced by man's activities causing the planet to warm up  But to answer that question  to make a clear attribution to carbon dioxide  you have to know something about all of these other agents of change. But the fact is we do know a lot about all of those things. You know  thousands of scientists have been working on understanding all of these man made causes and the natural causes. And we've got it worked out  and we can say   Yes  CO  is causing the planet to warm up now.  Now  we have many ways to study natural variability. I'll show you a few examples of this now. This is the ship that I spent the last three months on in the Antarctic. It's a scientific drilling vessel. We go out for months at a time and drill into the sea bed to recover sediments that tell us stories of climate change  right. Like one of the ways to understand our greenhouse future is to drill down in time to the last period where we had CO  double what it is today. And so that's what we've done with this ship. This was    this is south of the Antarctic Circle. It looks downright tropical there. One day where we had calm seas and sun  which was the reason I could get off the ship. Most of the time it looked like this. We had a waves up to    ft. and winds averaging about    knots for most of the voyage and up to    or    knots. So that trip just ended  and I can't show you too many results from that right now  but we'll go back one more year  to another drilling expedition I've been involved in. This was led by Ross Powell and Tim Naish. It's the ANDRILL project. And we made the very first bore hole through the largest floating ice shelf on the planet. This is a crazy thing  this big drill rig wrapped in a blanket to keep everybody warm  drilling at temperatures of minus   . And we drilled in the Ross Sea. That's the Ross Sea Ice Shelf on the right there. So  this huge floating ice shelf the size of Alaska comes from West Antarctica. Now  West Antarctica is the part of the continent where the ice is grounded on sea floor as much as       meters deep. So that ice sheet is partly floating  and it's exposed to the ocean  to the ocean heat. This is the part of Antarctica that we worry about. Because it's partly floating  you can imagine  is sea level rises a little bit  the ice lifts off the bed  and then it can break off and float north. When that ice melts  sea level rises by six meters. So we drill back in time to see how often that's happened  and exactly how fast that ice can melt. Here's the cartoon on the left there. We drilled through a hundred meters of floating ice shelf then through     meters of water and then       meters into the sea floor. So it's the deepest geological bore hole ever drilled. It took about    years to put this project together. And here's what we found. Now  there's    scientists working on this project  and people are doing all kinds of really complicated and expensive analyses. But it turns out  you know  the thing that told the best story was this simple visual description. You know  we saw this in the core samples as they came up. We saw these alternations between sediments that look like this    there's gravel and cobbles in there and a bunch of sand. That's the kind of material in the deep sea. It can only get there if it's carried out by ice. So we know there's an ice shelf overhead. And that alternates with a sediment that looks like this. This is absolutely beautiful stuff. This sediment is     percent made up of the shells of microscopic plants. And these plants need sunlight  so we know when we find that sediment there's no ice overhead. And we saw about    alternations between open water and ice covered water  between gravels and these plant sediments. So what that means is  what it tells us is that the Ross Sea region  this ice shelf  melted back and formed anew about    times. And this is in the past four million years. This was completely unexpected. Nobody imagined that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet was this dynamic. In fact  the lore for many years has been   The ice formed many tens of millions of years ago  and it's been there ever since.  And now we know that in our recent past it melted back and formed again  and sea level went up and down  six meters at a time. What caused it  Well  we're pretty sure that it's very small changes in the amount of sunlight reaching Antarctica  just caused by natural changes in the orbit of the Earth. But here's the key thing  you know  the other thing we found out is that the ice sheet passed a threshold  that the planet warmed up enough    and the number's about one degree to one and a half degrees Centigrade    the planet warmed up enough that it became ... that ice sheet became very dynamic and was very easily melted. And you know what  We've actually changed the temperature in the last century just the right amount. So many of us are convinced now that West Antarctica  the West Antarctic Ice Sheet  is starting to melt. We do expect to see a sea level rise on the order of one to two meters by the end of this century. And it could be larger than that. This is a serious consequence for nations like Kiribati  you know  where the average elevation is about a little over a meter above sea level. Okay  the second story takes place here in Galapagos. This is a bleached coral  coral that died during the      '   El Nino. This is from Champion Island. It's about a meter tall Pavona clavus colony. And it's covered with algae. That's what happens. When these things die  immediately  organisms come in and encrust and live on that dead surface. And so  when a coral colony is killed by an El Nino event  it leaves this indelible record. You can go then and study corals and figure out how often do you see this. So one of the things thought of in the '  s was to go back and take cores of coral heads throughout the Galapagos and find out how often was there a devastating event. And just so you know       '    that El Nino killed    percent of all the corals here in Galapagos. Then there was similar mortality in '   '  . And what we found after drilling back in time two to     years was that these were unique events. We saw no other mass mortality events. So these events in our recent past really are unique. So they're either just truly monster El Ninos  or they're just very strong El Ninos that occurred against a backdrop of global warming. Either case  it's bad news for the corals of the Galapagos Islands. Here's how we sample the corals. This is actually Easter Island. Look at this monster. This coral is eight meters tall  right. And it been growing for about     years. Now  Sylvia Earle turned me on to this exact same coral. And she was diving here with John Lauret    I think it was         and collected a little nugget and sent it to me. And we started working on it  and we figured out we could tell the temperature of the ancient ocean from analyzing a coral like this. So we have a diamond drill. We're not killing the colony  we're taking a small core sample out of the top. The core comes up as these cylindrical tubes of limestone. And that material then we take back to the lab and analyze it. You can see some of the coral cores there on the right. So we've done that all over the Eastern Pacific. We're starting to do it in the Western Pacific as well. I'll take you back here to the Galapagos Islands. And we've been working at this fascinating uplift here in Urbina Bay. That the place where  during an earthquake in       this marine terrace was lifted up out of the ocean very quickly  and it was lifted up about six to seven meters. And so now you can walk through a coral reef without getting wet. If you go on the ground there  it looks like this  and this is the grandaddy coral. It's    meters in diameter  and we know that it started growing in the year     . Imagine that. And that coral was growing happily in those shallow waters  until       when the earthquake happened. Now the reason we know it's      is that these corals have growth bands. When you cut them  slice those cores in half and x ray them  you see these light and dark bands. Each one of those is a year. We know these corals grow about a centimeter and a half a year. And we just count on down to the bottom. Then their other attribute is that they have this great chemistry. We can analyze the carbonate that makes up the coral  and there's a whole bunch of things we can do. But in this case  we measured the different isotopes of oxygen. Their ratio tells us the water temperature. In this example here  we had monitored this reef in Galapagos with temperature recorders  so we know the temperature of the water the coral's growing in. Then after we harvest a coral  we measure this ratio  and now you can see  those curves match perfectly. In this case  at these islands  you know  corals are instrumental quality recorders of change in the water. And of course  our thermometers only take us back    years or so here. The coral can take us back hundreds and thousands of years. So  what we do  we've merged a lot of different data sets. It's not just my group  there's maybe    groups worldwide doing this. But we get these instrumental  and near instrumental quality records of temperature change that go back hundreds of years  and we put them together. Here's a synthetic diagram. There's a whole family of curves here. But what's happening  we're looking at the last thousand years of temperature on the planet. And there's five or six different compilations there  But each one of those compilations reflects input from hundreds of these kinds of records from corals. We do similar things with ice cores. We work with tree rings. And that's how we discover what is truly natural and how different is the last century  right  And I chose this one because it's complicated and messy looking  right. This is as messy as it gets. You can see there's some signals there. Some of the records show lower temperatures than others. Some of them show greater variability. But they all tell us what the natural variability is. Some of them are from the northern hemisphere  some are from the entire globe. But here's what we can say  what's natural in the last thousand years is that the planet was cooling down. It was cooling down until about      or so. And there is natural variability caused by the Sun  caused by El Ninos. A century scale  decadal scale variability  and we know the magnitude  it's about two tenths to four tenths of a degree Centigrade. But then at the very end is where we have the instrumental record in black. And there's the temperature up there in     . You know  we've warmed the globe about a degree Centigrade in the last century  and there's nothing in the natural part of that record that resembles what we've seen in the last century. You know  that's the strength of our argument  that we are doing something that's truly different. So I'll close with a short discussion of ocean acidification. I like it as a component of global change to talk about  because  even if you are a hard bitten global warming skeptic  and I talk to that community fairly often  you cannot deny the simple physics of CO  dissolving in the ocean. You know  we're pumping out lots of CO  into the atmosphere  from fossil fuels  from cement production. Right now  about a third of that carbon dioxide is dissolving straight into the sea  right  And as it does so  it makes the ocean more acidic. So  you cannot argue with that. That is what's happening right now  and it's a very different issue than the global warming issue. It has many consequences. There's consequences for carbonate organisms. There are many organisms that build their shells out of calcium carbonate    plants and animals both. The main framework material of coral reefs is calcium carbonate. That material is more soluble in acidic fluid. So one of the things we're seeing is organisms are having to spend more metabolic energy to build and maintain their shells. At some point  as this transience  as this CO  uptake in the ocean continues  that material's actually going to start to dissolve. And on coral reefs  where some of the main framework organisms disappear  we will see a major loss of marine biodiversity. But it's not just the carbonate producers that are affected. There's many physiological processes that are influenced by the acidity of the ocean. So many reactions involving enzymes and proteins are sensitive to the acid content of the ocean. So  all of these things    greater metabolic demands  reduced reproductive success  changes in respiration and metabolism. You know  these are things that we have good physiological reasons to expect to see stressed caused by this transience. So we figured out some pretty interesting ways to track CO  levels in the atmosphere  going back millions of years. We used to do it just with ice cores  but in this case  we're going back    million years. And we take samples of the sediment  and it tells us the CO  level of the ocean  and therefore the CO  level of the atmosphere. And here's the thing  you have to go back about    million years to find a time when CO  levels were about what they are today. You have to go back about    million years to find a time when CO  levels were double what they are today. Now  what that means is that all of the organisms that live in the sea have evolved in this chemostatted ocean  with CO  levels lower than they are today. That's the reason that they're not able to respond or adapt to this rapid acidification that's going on right now. So  Charlie Veron came up with this statement last year   The prospect of ocean acidification may well be the most serious of all of the predicted outcomes of anthropogenic CO  release.  And I think that may very well be true  so I'll close with this. You know  we do need the protected areas  absolutely  but for the sake of the oceans  we have to cap or limit CO  emissions as soon as possible. Thank you very much. If nothing else  at least I've discovered what it is we put our speakers through  sweaty palms  sleepless nights  a wholly unnatural fear of clocks. I mean  it's quite brutal. And I'm also a little nervous about this. There are nine billion humans coming our way. Now  the most optimistic dreams can get dented by the prospect of people plundering the planet. But recently  I've become intrigued by a different way of thinking of large human crowds  because there are circumstances where they can do something really cool. It's a phenomenon that I think any organization or individual can tap into. It certainly impacted the way we think about TED's future  and perhaps the world's future overall. So  let's explore. The story starts with just a single person  a child  behaving a little strangely. This kid is known online as Lil Demon. He's doing tricks here  dance tricks  that probably no six year old in history ever managed before. How did he learn them  And what drove him to spend the hundreds of hours of practice this must have taken  Here's a clue.   Step your game up. Oh. Oh.   Chris Anderson  So  that was sent to me by this man  a filmmaker  Jonathan Chu  who told me that was the moment he realized the Internet was causing dance to evolve. This is what he said at TED in February. In essence  dancers were challenging each other online to get better  incredible new dance skills were being invented  even the six year olds were joining in. It felt like a revolution. And so Jon had a brilliant idea  He went out to recruit the best of the best dancers off of YouTube to create this dance troupe    The League of Extraordinary Dancers  the LXD. I mean  these kids were web taught  but they were so good that they got to play at the Oscars this year. And at TED here in February  their passion and brilliance just took our breath away. So  this story of the evolution of dance seems strangely familiar. You know  a while after TEDTalks started taking off  we noticed that speakers were starting to spend a lot more time in preparation. It was resulting in incredible new talks like these two. ... Months of preparation crammed into    minutes  raising the bar cruelly for the next generation of speakers  with the effects that we've seen this week. It's not as if J.J. and Jill actually ended their talks saying   Step your game up   but they might as well have. So  in both of these cases  you've got these cycles of improvement  apparently driven by people watching web video. What is going on here  Well  I think it's the latest iteration of a phenomenon we can call  crowd accelerated innovation.  And there are just three things you need for this thing to kick into gear. You can think of them as three dials on a giant wheel. You turn up the dials  the wheel starts to turn. And the first thing you need is ... a crowd  a group of people who share a common interest. The bigger the crowd  the more potential innovators there are. That's important  but actually most people in the crowd occupy these other roles. They're creating the ecosystem from which innovation emerges. The second thing you need is light. You need clear  open visibility of what the best people in that crowd are capable of  because that is how you will learn how you will be empowered to participate. And third  you need desire. You know  innovation's hard work. It's based on hundreds of hours of research  of practice. Absent desire  not going to happen. Now  here's an example    pre Internet    of this machine in action. Dancers at a street corner    it's a crowd  a small one  but they can all obviously see what each other can do. And the desire part comes  I guess  from social status  right  Best dancer walks tall  gets the best date. There's probably going to be some innovation happening here. But on the web  all three dials are ratcheted right up. The dance community is now global. There's millions connected. And amazingly  you can still see what the best can do  because the crowd itself shines a light on them  either directly  through comments  ratings  email  Facebook  Twitter  or indirectly  through numbers of views  through links that point Google there. So  it's easy to find the good stuff  and when you've found it  you can watch it in close up repeatedly and read what hundreds of people have written about it. That's a lot of light. But the desire element is really dialed way up. I mean  you might just be a kid with a webcam  but if you can do something that goes viral  you get to be seen by the equivalent of sports stadiums crammed with people. You get hundreds of strangers writing excitedly about you. And even if it's not that eloquent    and it's not    it can still really make your day. So  this possibility of a new type of global recognition  I think  is driving huge amounts of effort. And it's important to note that it's not just the stars who are benefiting  because you can see the best  everyone can learn. Also  the system is self fueling. It's the crowd that shines the light and fuels the desire  but the light and desire are a lethal one two combination that attract new people to the crowd. So  this is a model that pretty much any organization could use to try and nurture its own cycle of crowd accelerated innovation. Invite the crowd  let in the light  dial up the desire. And the hardest part about that is probably the light  because it means you have to open up  you have to show your stuff to the world. It's by giving away what you think is your deepest secret that maybe millions of people are empowered to help improve it. And  very happily  there's one class of people who really can't make use of this tool. The dark side of the web is allergic to the light. I don't think we're going to see terrorists  for example  publishing their plans online and saying to the world   Please  could you help us to actually make them work this time   But you can publish your stuff online. And if you can get that wheel to turn  look out. So  at TED  we've become a little obsessed with this idea of openness. In fact  my colleague  June Cohen  has taken to calling it  radical openness   because it works for us each time. We opened up our talks to the world  and suddenly there are millions of people out there helping spread our speakers' ideas  and thereby making it easier for us to recruit and motivate the next generation of speakers. By opening up our translation program  thousands of heroic volunteers    some of them watching online right now  and thank you     have translated our talks into more than    languages  thereby tripling our viewership in non English speaking countries. By giving away our TEDx brand  we suddenly have a thousand plus live experiments in the art of spreading ideas. And these organizers  they're seeing each other  they're learning from each other. We are learning from them. We're getting great talks back from them. The wheel is turning. Okay  step back a minute. I mean  it's really not news for me to tell you that innovation emerges out of groups. You know  we've heard that this week    this romantic notion of the lone genius with the  eureka   moment that changes the world is misleading. Even he said that  and he would know. We're a social species. We spark off each other. It's also not news to say that the Internet has accelerated innovation. For the past    years  powerful communities have been connecting online  sparking off each other. If you take programmers  you know  the whole open source movement is a fantastic instance of crowd accelerated innovation. But what's key here is  the reason these groups have been able to connect is because their work output is of the type that can be easily shared digitally    a picture  a music file  software. And that's why what I'm excited about  and what I think is under reported  is the significance of the rise of online video. This is the technology that's going to allow the rest of the world's talents to be shared digitally  thereby launching a whole new cycle of crowd accelerated innovation. The first few years of the web were pretty much video free  for this reason  video files are huge  the web couldn't handle them. But in the last    years  bandwidth has exploded a hundredfold. Suddenly  here we are. Humanity watches    million hours of YouTube every day. Cisco actually estimates that  within four years  more than    percent of the web's data will be video. If it's all puppies  porn and piracy  we're doomed. I don't think it will be. Video is high bandwidth for a reason. It packs a huge amount of data  and our brains are uniquely wired to decode it. Here  let me introduce you to Sam Haber. He's a unicyclist. Before YouTube  there was no way for him to discover his sport's true potential  because you can't communicate this stuff in words  right  But looking at video clips posted by strangers  a world of possibility opens up for him. Suddenly  he starts to emulate and then to innovate. And a global community of unicyclists discover each other online  inspire each other to greatness. And there are thousands of other examples of this happening    of video driven evolution of skills  ranging from the physical to the artful. And I have to tell you  as a former publisher of hobbyist magazines  I find this strangely beautiful. I mean  there's a lot of passion right here on this screen. But if Rube Goldberg machines and video poetry aren't quite your cup of tea  how about this. Jove is a website that was founded to encourage scientists to publish their peer reviewed research on video. There's a problem with a traditional scientific paper. It can take months for a scientist in another lab to figure out how to replicate the experiments that are described in print. Here's one such frustrated scientist  Moshe Pritsker  the founder of Jove. He told me that the world is wasting billions of dollars on this. But look at this video. I mean  look  if you can show instead of just describing  that problem goes away. So it's not far fetched to say that  at some point  online video is going to dramatically accelerate scientific advance. Here's another example that's close to our hearts at TED  where video is sometimes more powerful than print    the sharing of an idea. Why do people like watching TEDTalks  All those ideas are already out there in print. It's actually faster to read than to view. Why would someone bother  Well  so  there's some showing as well as telling. But even leaving the screen out of it  there's still a lot more being transferred than just words. And in that non verbal portion  there's some serious magic. Somewhere hidden in the physical gestures  the vocal cadence  the facial expressions  the eye contact  the passion  the kind of awkward  British body language  the sense of how the audience are reacting  there are hundreds of subconscious clues that go to how well you will understand  and whether you're inspired    light  if you like  and desire. Incredibly  all of this can be communicated on just a few square inches of a screen. Reading and writing are actually relatively recent inventions. Face to face communication has been fine tuned by millions of years of evolution. That's what's made it into this mysterious  powerful thing it is. Someone speaks  there's resonance in all these receiving brains  the whole group acts together. I mean  this is the connective tissue of the human superorganism in action. It's probably driven our culture for millennia.     years ago  it ran into a competitor with a lethal advantage. It's right here. Print scaled. The world's ambitious innovators and influencers now could get their ideas to spread far and wide  and so the art of the spoken word pretty much withered on the vine. But now  in the blink of an eye  the game has changed again. It's not too much to say that what Gutenberg did for writing  online video can now do for face to face communication. So  that primal medium  which your brain is exquisitely wired for ... that just went global. Now  this is big. We may have to reinvent an ancient art form. I mean  today  one person speaking can be seen by millions  shedding bright light on potent ideas  creating intense desire for learning and to respond    and in his case  intense desire to laugh. For the first time in human history  talented students don't have to have their potential and their dreams written out of history by lousy teachers. They can sit two feet in front of the world's finest. Now  TED is just a small part of this. I mean  the world's universities are opening up their curricula. Thousands of individuals and organizations are sharing their knowledge and data online. Thousands of people are figuring out new ways to learn and  crucially  to respond  completing the cycle. And so  as we've thought about this  you know  it's become clear to us what the next stage of TED's evolution has to be. TEDTalks can't be a one way process  one to many. Our future is many to many. So  we're dreaming of ways to make it easier for you  the global TED community  to respond to speakers  to contribute your own ideas  maybe even your own TEDTalks  and to help shine a light on the very best of what's out there. Because  if we can bubble up the very best from a vastly larger pool  this wheel turns. Now  is it possible to imagine a similar process to this  happening to global education overall  I mean  does it have to be this painful  top down process  Why not a self fueling cycle in which we all can participate  It's the participation age  right  Schools can't be silos. We can't stop learning at age   . What if  in the coming crowd of nine billion ... what if that crowd could learn enough to be net contributors  instead of net plunderers  That changes everything  right  I mean  that would take more teachers than we've ever had. But the good news is they are out there. They're in the crowd  and the crowd is switching on lights  and we can see them for the first time  not as an undifferentiated mass of strangers  but as individuals we can learn from. Who's the teacher  You're the teacher. You're part of the crowd that may be about to launch the biggest learning cycle in human history  a cycle capable of carrying all of us to a smarter  wiser  more beautiful place. Here's a group of kids in a village in Pakistan near where I grew up. Within five years  each of these kids is going to have access to a cellphone capable of full on web video and capable of uploading video to the web. I mean  is it crazy to think that this girl  in the back  at the right  in    years  might be sharing the idea that keeps the world beautiful for your grandchildren  It's not crazy  it's actually happening right now. I want to introduce you to a good friend of TED who just happens to live in Africa's biggest shantytown. I'm one of the organizers of TEDxKibera. There are so many good things which are happening right here in Kibera. There's a self help group. They turned a trash place into a garden. The same spot  it was a crime spot where people were being robbed. They used the same trash to form green manure. The same trash site is feeding more than    families. We have our own film school. They are using Flip cameras to record  edit  and reporting to their own channel  Kibera TV. Because of a scarcity of land  we are using the sacks to grow vegetables  and also  we're  able to save on the cost of living. Change happens when we see things in a different way. Today  I see Kibera in a different way. My message to TEDGlobal and the entire world is  Kibera is a hotbed of innovation and ideas. CA  You know what  I bet Chris has always been an inspiring guy. What's new    and it's huge    is that  for the first time  we get to see him  and he can see us. Right now  Chris and Kevin and Dennis and Dickson and their friends are watching us  in Nairobi  right now. Guys  we've learned from you today. Thank you. And thank you. Let's start with day and night. Life evolved under conditions of light and darkness  light and then darkness. And so plants and animals developed their own internal clocks so that they would be ready for these changes in light. These are chemical clocks  and they're found in every known being that has two or more cells and in some that only have one cell. I'll give you an example    if you take a horseshoe crab off the beach  and you fly it all the way across the continent  and you drop it into a sloped cage  it will scramble up the floor of the cage as the tide is rising on its home shores  and it'll skitter down again right as the water is receding thousands of miles away. It'll do this for weeks  until it kind of gradually loses the plot. And it's incredible to watch  but there's nothing psychic or paranormal going on  it's simply that these crabs have internal cycles that correspond  usually  with what's going on around it. So  we have this ability as well. And in humans  we call it the  body clock.  You can see this most clearly when you take away someone's watch and you shut them into a bunker  deep underground  for a couple of months.  Laughter  People actually volunteer for this  and they usually come out kind of raving about their productive time in the hole. So  no matter how atypical these subjects would have to be  they all show the same thing. They get up just a little bit later every day    say    minutes or so    and they kind of drift all the way around the clock like this over the course of the weeks. And so  in this way we know that they are working on their own internal clocks  rather than somehow sensing the day outside. So fine  we have a body clock  and it turns out that it's incredibly important in our lives. It's a huge driver for culture and I think that it's the most underrated force on our behavior. We evolved as a species near the equator  and so we're very well equipped to deal with    hours of daylight and    hours of darkness. But of course  we've spread to every corner of the globe and in Arctic Canada  where I live  we have perpetual daylight in summer and    hours of darkness in winter. So the culture  the northern aboriginal culture  traditionally has been highly seasonal. In winter  there's a lot of sleeping going on  you enjoy your family life inside. And in summer  it's almost manic hunting and working activity very long hours  very active. So  what would our natural rhythm look like  What would our sleeping patterns be in the sort of ideal sense  Well  it turns out that when people are living without any sort of artificial light at all  they sleep twice every night. They go to bed around      p.m. until midnight and then again  they sleep from about      a.m. until sunrise. And in between  they have a couple of hours of sort of meditative quiet in bed. And during this time  there's a surge of prolactin  the likes of which a modern day never sees. The people in these studies report feeling so awake during the daytime  that they realize they're experiencing true wakefulness for the first time in their lives. So  cut to the modern day. We're living in a culture of jet lag  global travel     hour business  shift work. And you know  our modern ways of doing things have their advantages  but I believe we should understand the costs. Thank you. For the last    years  I've been spending my time trying to figure out how and why human beings assemble themselves into social networks. And the kind of social network I'm talking about is not the recent online variety  but rather  the kind of social networks that human beings have been assembling for hundreds of thousands of years  ever since we emerged from the African savannah. So  I form friendships and co worker and sibling and relative relationships with other people who in turn have similar relationships with other people. And this spreads on out endlessly into a distance. And you get a network that looks like this. Every dot is a person. Every line between them is a relationship between two people    different kinds of relationships. And you can get this kind of vast fabric of humanity  in which we're all embedded. And my colleague  James Fowler and I have been studying for quite sometime what are the mathematical  social  biological and psychological rules that govern how these networks are assembled and what are the similar rules that govern how they operate  how they affect our lives. But recently  we've been wondering whether it might be possible to take advantage of this insight  to actually find ways to improve the world  to do something better  to actually fix things  not just understand things. So one of the first things we thought we would tackle would be how we go about predicting epidemics. And the current state of the art in predicting an epidemic    if you're the CDC or some other national body    is to sit in the middle where you are and collect data from physicians and laboratories in the field that report the prevalence or the incidence of certain conditions. So  so and so patients have been diagnosed with something  or other patients have been diagnosed  and all these data are fed into a central repository  with some delay. And if everything goes smoothly  one to two weeks from now you'll know where the epidemic was today. And actually  about a year or so ago  there was this promulgation of the idea of Google Flu Trends  with respect to the flu  where by looking at people's searching behavior today  we could know where the flu    what the status of the epidemic was today  what's the prevalence of the epidemic today. But what I'd like to show you today is a means by which we might get not just rapid warning about an epidemic  but also actually early detection of an epidemic. And  in fact  this idea can be used not just to predict epidemics of germs  but also to predict epidemics of all sorts of kinds. For example  anything that spreads by a form of social contagion could be understood in this way  from abstract ideas on the left like patriotism  or altruism  or religion to practices like dieting behavior  or book purchasing  or drinking  or bicycle helmet  and  other safety practices  or products that people might buy  purchases of electronic goods  anything in which there's kind of an interpersonal spread. A kind of a diffusion of innovation could be understood and predicted by the mechanism I'm going to show you now. So  as all of you probably know  the classic way of thinking about this is the diffusion of innovation  or the adoption curve. So here on the Y axis  we have the percent of the people affected  and on the X axis  we have time. And at the very beginning  not too many people are affected  and you get this classic sigmoidal  or S shaped  curve. And the reason for this shape is that at the very beginning  let's say one or two people are infected  or affected by the thing and then they affect  or infect  two people  who in turn affect four  eight     and so forth  and you get the epidemic growth phase of the curve. And eventually  you saturate the population. There are fewer and fewer people who are still available that you might infect  and then you get the plateau of the curve  and you get this classic sigmoidal curve. And this holds for germs  ideas  product adoption  behaviors  and the like. But things don't just diffuse in human populations at random. They actually diffuse through networks. Because  as I said  we live our lives in networks  and these networks have a particular kind of a structure. Now if you look at a network like this    this is     people. And the lines represent    the dots are the people  and the lines represent friendship relationships. You might see that people occupy different locations within the network. And there are different kinds of relationships between the people. You could have friendship relationships  sibling relationships  spousal relationships  co worker relationships  neighbor relationships and the like. And different sorts of things spread across different sorts of ties. For instance  sexually transmitted diseases will spread across sexual ties. Or  for instance  people's smoking behavior might be influenced by their friends. Or their altruistic or their charitable giving behavior might be influenced by their coworkers  or by their neighbors. But not all positions in the network are the same. So if you look at this  you might immediately grasp that different people have different numbers of connections. Some people have one connection  some have two  some have six  some have    connections. And this is called the  degree  of a node  or the number of connections that a node has. But in addition  there's something else. So  if you look at nodes A and B  they both have six connections. But if you can see this image  of the network  from a bird's eye view  you can appreciate that there's something very different about nodes A and B. So  let me ask you this    I can cultivate this intuition by asking a question    who would you rather be if a deadly germ was spreading through the network  A or B  B is located on the edge of the network. Now  who would you rather be if a juicy piece of gossip were spreading through the network  A. And you have an immediate appreciation that A is going to be more likely to get the thing that's spreading and to get it sooner by virtue of their structural location within the network. A  in fact  is more central  and this can be formalized mathematically. So  if we want to track something that was spreading through a network  what we ideally would like to do is to set up sensors on the central individuals within the network  including node A  monitor those people that are right there in the middle of the network  and somehow get an early detection of whatever it is that is spreading through the network. So if you saw them contract a germ or a piece of information  you would know that  soon enough  everybody was about to contract this germ or this piece of information. And this would be much better than monitoring six randomly chosen people  without reference to the structure of the population. And in fact  if you could do that  what you would see is something like this. On the left hand panel  again  we have the S shaped curve of adoption. In the dotted red line  we show what the adoption would be in the random people  and in the left hand line  shifted to the left  we show what the adoption would be in the central individuals within the network. On the Y axis is the cumulative instances of contagion  and on the X axis is the time. And on the right hand side  we show the same data  but here with daily incidence. And what we show here is    like  here    very few people are affected  more and more and more and up to here  and here's the peak of the epidemic. But shifted to the left is what's occurring in the central individuals. And this difference in time between the two is the early detection  the early warning we can get  about an impending epidemic in the human population. The problem  however  is that mapping human social networks is not always possible. It can be expensive  not feasible  unethical  or  frankly  just not possible to do such a thing. So  how can we figure out who the central people are in a network without actually mapping the network  What we came up with was an idea to exploit an old fact  or a known fact  about social networks  which goes like this  Do you know that your friends have more friends than you do  Your friends have more friends than you do  and this is known as the friendship paradox. Imagine a very popular person in the social network    like a party host who has hundreds of friends    and a misanthrope who has just one friend  and you pick someone at random from the population  they were much more likely to know the party host. And if they nominate the party host as their friend  that party host has a hundred friends  therefore  has more friends than they do. And this  in essence  is what's known as the friendship paradox. The friends of randomly chosen people have higher degree  and are more central than the random people themselves. And you can get an intuitive appreciation for this if you imagine just the people at the perimeter of the network. If you pick this person  the only friend they have to nominate is this person  who  by construction  must have at least two and typically more friends. And that happens at every peripheral node. And in fact  it happens throughout the network as you move in  everyone you pick  when they nominate a random    when a random person nominates a friend of theirs  you move closer to the center of the network. So  we thought we would exploit this idea in order to study whether we could predict phenomena within networks. Because now  with this idea we can take a random sample of people  have them nominate their friends  those friends would be more central  and we could do this without having to map the network. And we tested this idea with an outbreak of H N  flu at Harvard College in the fall and winter of       just a few months ago. We took       randomly selected undergraduates  we had them nominate their friends  and we followed both the random students and their friends daily in time to see whether or not they had the flu epidemic. And we did this passively by looking at whether or not they'd gone to university health services. And also  we had them  actively  email us a couple of times a week. Exactly what we predicted happened. So the random group is in the red line. The epidemic in the friends group has shifted to the left  over here. And the difference in the two is    days. By monitoring the friends group  we could get    days advance warning of an impending epidemic in this human population. Now  in addition to that  if you were an analyst who was trying to study an epidemic or to predict the adoption of a product  for example  what you could do is you could pick a random sample of the population  also have them nominate their friends and follow the friends and follow both the randoms and the friends. Among the friends  the first evidence you saw of a blip above zero in adoption of the innovation  for example  would be evidence of an impending epidemic. Or you could see the first time the two curves diverged  as shown on the left. When did the randoms    when did the friends take off and leave the randoms  and  when did  their curve start shifting  And that  as indicated by the white line  occurred    days before the peak of the epidemic. So this would be a technique whereby we could get more than a month and a half warning about a flu epidemic in a particular population. I should say that how far advanced a notice one might get about something depends on a host of factors. It could depend on the nature of the pathogen    different pathogens  using this technique  you'd get different warning    or other phenomena that are spreading  or frankly  on the structure of the human network. Now in our case  although it wasn't necessary  we could also actually map the network of the students. So  this is a map of     students and their friendship ties. And in a minute now  I'm going to put this map into motion. We're going to take daily cuts through the network for     days. The red dots are going to be cases of the flu  and the yellow dots are going to be friends of the people with the flu. And the size of the dots is going to be proportional to how many of their friends have the flu. So bigger dots mean more of your friends have the flu. And if you look at this image    here we are now in September the   th    you're going to see a few cases light up. You're going to see kind of blooming of the flu in the middle. Here we are on October the   th. The slope of the epidemic curve is approaching now  in November. Bang  bang  bang  bang  bang    you're going to see lots of blooming in the middle  and then you're going to see a sort of leveling off  fewer and fewer cases towards the end of December. And this type of a visualization can show that epidemics like this take root and affect central individuals first  before they affect others. Now  as I've been suggesting  this method is not restricted to germs  but actually to anything that spreads in populations. Information spreads in populations  norms can spread in populations  behaviors can spread in populations. And by behaviors  I can mean things like criminal behavior  or voting behavior  or health care behavior  like smoking  or vaccination  or product adoption  or other kinds of behaviors that relate to interpersonal influence. If I'm likely to do something that affects others around me  this technique can get early warning or early detection about the adoption within the population. The key thing is that for it to work  there has to be interpersonal influence. It cannot be because of some broadcast mechanism affecting everyone uniformly. Now the same insights can also be exploited    with respect to networks    can also be exploited in other ways  for example  in the use of targeting specific people for interventions. So  for example  most of you are probably familiar with the notion of herd immunity. So  if we have a population of a thousand people  and we want to make the population immune to a pathogen  we don't have to immunize every single person. If we immunize     of them  it's as if we had immunized a hundred  percent  of them. Because even if one or two of the non immune people gets infected  there's no one for them to infect. They are surrounded by immunized people. So    percent is as good as     percent. Well  some other scientists have estimated what would happen if you took a    percent random sample of these      people      people and immunized them. Would you get any population level immunity  And the answer is no. But if you took this    percent  these     people and had them nominate their friends and took the same number of vaccine doses and vaccinated the friends of the        the     friends    you can get the same level of herd immunity as if you had vaccinated    percent of the population at a much greater efficiency  with a strict budget constraint. And similar ideas can be used  for instance  to target distribution of things like bed nets in the developing world. If we could understand the structure of networks in villages  we could target to whom to give the interventions to foster these kinds of spreads. Or  frankly  for advertising with all kinds of products. If we could understand how to target  it could affect the efficiency of what we're trying to achieve. And in fact  we can use data from all kinds of sources nowadays  to do this . This is a map of eight million phone users in a European country. Every dot is a person  and every line represents a volume of calls between the people. And we can use such data  that's being passively obtained  to map these whole countries and understand who is located where within the network. Without actually having to query them at all  we can get this kind of a structural insight. And other sources of information  as you're no doubt aware are available about such features  from email interactions  online interactions  online social networks and so forth. And in fact  we are in the era of what I would call  massive passive  data collection efforts. They're all kinds of ways we can use massively collected data to create sensor networks to follow the population  understand what's happening in the population  and intervene in the population for the better. Because these new technologies tell us not just who is talking to whom  but where everyone is  and what they're thinking based on what they're uploading on the Internet  and what they're buying based on their purchases. And all this administrative data can be pulled together and processed to understand human behavior in a way we never could before. So  for example  we could use truckers' purchases of fuel. So the truckers are just going about their business  and they're buying fuel. And we see a blip up in the truckers' purchases of fuel  and we know that a recession is about to end. Or we can monitor the velocity with which people are moving with their phones on a highway  and the phone company can see  as the velocity is slowing down  that there's a traffic jam. And they can feed that information back to their subscribers  but only to their subscribers on the same highway located behind the traffic jam  Or we can monitor doctors prescribing behaviors  passively  and see how the diffusion of innovation with pharmaceuticals occurs within  networks of  doctors. Or again  we can monitor purchasing behavior in people and watch how these types of phenomena can diffuse within human populations. And there are three ways  I think  that these massive passive data can be used. One is fully passive  like I just described    as in  for instance  the trucker example  where we don't actually intervene in the population in any way. One is quasi active  like the flu example I gave  where we get some people to nominate their friends and then passively monitor their friends    do they have the flu  or not     and then get warning. Or another example would be  if you're a phone company  you figure out who's central in the network and you ask those people   Look  will you just text us your fever every day  Just text us your temperature.  And collect vast amounts of information about people's temperature  but from centrally located individuals. And be able  on a large scale  to monitor an impending epidemic with very minimal input from people. Or  finally  it can be more fully active    as I know subsequent speakers will also talk about today    where people might globally participate in wikis  or photographing  or monitoring elections  and upload information in a way that allows us to pool information in order to understand social processes and social phenomena. In fact  the availability of these data  I think  heralds a kind of new era of what I and others would like to call  computational social science.  It's sort of like when Galileo invented    or  didn't invent    came to use a telescope and could see the heavens in a new way  or Leeuwenhoek became aware of the microscope    or actually invented    and could see biology in a new way. But now we have access to these kinds of data that allow us to understand social processes and social phenomena in an entirely new way that was never before possible. And with this science  we can understand how exactly the whole comes to be greater than the sum of its parts. And actually  we can use these insights to improve society and improve human well being. Thank you. Now  since this is TEDGlobal  who can tell me what this is called in French  I see you're all up on the history of hurdy gurdy     vielle   roue.  And in Spanish   zanfona.  And in Italian   ghironda   okay  Hurdy gurdy  or wheel fiddle. So  these are the different kinds and shapes of the hurdy gurdy. The hurdy gurdy is the only musical instrument that uses a crank to turn a wheel to rub strings  like the bow of a violin  to produce music. It has three different kinds of strings. The first string is the drone string  which plays a continuous sound like the bagpipe. The second string is a melody string  which is played with a wooden keyboard tuned like a piano. And the third string is pretty innovative. It's also the only instrument that uses this kind of technique. It activates what's called the buzzing bridge  or the dog. When I turn the crank and I apply pressure  it makes a sound like a barking dog. So all of this is pretty innovative  if you consider that the hurdy gurdy appeared about a thousand years ago and it took two people to play it  one to turn the crank  and another person    yes    to play the melody by physically pulling up large wooden pegs. Luckily  all of this changed a couple of centuries later. So  one person could actually play and almost    this is pretty heavy    carry the hurdy gurdy. The hurdy gurdy has been used  historically  through the centuries in mostly dance music because of the uniqueness of the melody combined with the acoustic boombox here. And today  the hurdy gurdy is used in all sorts of music    traditional folk music  dance  contemporary and world music    in the U.K.  in France  in Spain and in Italy. And this kind of hurdy gurdy takes anywhere from three to five years  to order and receive it . It's made by specialized luthiers  also in Europe. And it's very difficult to tune. So without further ado  would you like to hear it  Caroline Phillips  I didn't hear you. Would you like to hear it   Audience  Yes   CP  Okay. There I go. I'd like to sing in Basque  which is the language spoken in the Basque Country where I live  in the region in France and Spain.  Basque  Thank you. This is a song that I wrote based on traditional Basque rhythms. And this is a song that has a kind of a Celtic feel. Thank you. Thank you. Hello. I would like to start my talk with actually two questions  and the first one is  How many people here actually eat pig meat  Please raise your hand    oh  that's a lot. And how many people have actually seen a live pig producing this meat  In the last year  In the Netherlands    where I come from    you actually never see a pig  which is really strange  because  on a population of    million people  we have    million pigs. And well  of course  the Dutch can't eat all these pigs. They eat about one third  and the rest is exported to all kinds of countries in Europe and the rest of the world. A lot goes to the U.K.  Germany. And what I was curious about    because historically  the whole pig would be used up until the last bit so nothing would be wasted    and I was curious to find out if this was actually still the case. And I spent about three years researching. And I followed this one pig with number          all the way up until the end and to what products it's made of. And in these years  I met all kinds people like  for instance  farmers and butchers  which seems logical. But I also met aluminum mold makers  ammunition producers and all kinds of people. And what was striking to me is that the farmers actually had no clue what was made of their pigs  but the consumers    as in us    had also no idea of the pigs being in all these products. So what I did is  I took all this research and I made it into a    well  basically it's a product catalog of this one pig  and it carries a duplicate of his ear tag on the back. And it consists of seven chapters    the chapters are skin  bones  meat  internal organs  blood  fat and miscellaneous. In total  they weigh    .  kilograms. And to show you how often you actually meet part of this pig in a regular day  I want to show you some images of the book. You probably start the day with a shower. So  in soap  fatty acids made from boiling pork bone fat are used as a hardening agent  but also for giving it a pearl like effect. Then if you look around you in the bathroom  you see lots more products like shampoo  conditioner  anti wrinkle cream  body lotion  but also toothpaste. Then  so  before breakfast  you've already met the pig so many times. Then  at breakfast  the pig that I followed  the hairs off the pig or proteins from the hairs off the pig were used as an improver of dough. Well  that's what the producer says  it's  improving the dough  of course.  In low fat butter  or actually in many low fat products  when you take the fat out  you actually take the taste and the texture out. So what they do is they put gelatin back in  in order to retain the texture. Well  when you're off to work  under the road or under the buildings that you see  there might very well be cellular concrete  which is a very light kind of concrete that's actually got proteins from bones inside and it's also fully reusable. In the train brakes    at least in the German train brakes    there's this part of the brake that's made of bone ash. And in cheesecake and all kinds of desserts  like chocolate mousse  tiramisu  vanilla pudding  everything that's cooled in the supermarket  there's gelatin to make it look good. Fine bone china    this is a real classic. Of course  the bone in fine bone china gives it its translucency and also its strength  in order to make these really fine shapes  like this deer. In interior decorating  the pig's actually quite there. It's used in paint for the texture  but also for the glossiness. In sandpaper  bone glue is actually the glue between the sand and the paper. And then in paintbrushes  hairs are used because  apparently  they're very suitable for making paintbrushes because of their hard wearing nature. I was not planning on showing you any meat because  of course  half the book's meat and you probably all know what meats they are. But I didn't want you to miss out on this one  because this  well  it's called  portion controlled meat cuts.  And this is actually sold in the frozen area of the supermarket. And what it is    it's actually steak. So  this is sold as cow  but what happens when you slaughter a cow    at least in industrial factory farming    they have all these little bits of steak left that they can't actually sell as steak  so what they do is they glue them all together with fibrin from pig blood into this really large sausage  then freeze the sausage  cut it in little slices and sell those as steak again. And this also actually happens with tuna and scallops. So  with the steak  you might drink a beer. In the brewing process  there's lots of cloudy elements in the beer  so to get rid of these cloudy elements  what some companies do is they pour the beer through a sort of gelatin sieve in order to get rid of that cloudiness. This actually also goes for wine as well as fruit juice. There's actually a company in Greece that produces these cigarettes that actually contain hemoglobin from pigs in the filter. And according to them  this creates an artificial lung in the filter. So  this is actually a healthier cigarette. Injectable collagen    or  since the '  s  collagen from pigs    has been used for injecting into wrinkles. And the reason for this is that pigs are actually quite close to human beings  so the collagen is as well. Well  this must be the strangest thing I found. This is a bullet coming from a very large ammunition company in the United States. And while I was making the book  I contacted all the producers of products because I wanted them to send me the real samples and the real specimens. So I sent this company an email saying   Hello. I'm Christien. I'm doing this research. And can you send me a bullet   And well  I didn't expect them to even answer my email. But they answered and they said   Why  thank you for your email. What an interesting story. Are you in anyway related to the Dutch government   I thought that was really weird  as if the Dutch government sends emails to anyone. So  the most beautiful thing I found    at least what I think is the most beautiful    in the book  is this heart valve. It's actually a very low tech and very high tech product at the same time. The low tech bit is that it's literally a pig's heart valve mounted in the high tech bit  which is a memory metal casing. And what happens is this can be implanted into a human heart without open heart surgery. And once it's in the right spot  they remove the outer shell  and the heart valve  well  it gets this shape and at that moment it starts beating  instantly. It's really a sort of magical moment. So this is actually a Dutch company  so I called them up  and I asked   Can I borrow a heart valve from you   And the makers of this thing were really enthusiastic. So they were like   Okay  we'll put it in a jar for you with formalin  and you can borrow it.  Great    and then I didn't hear from them for weeks  so I called  and I asked   What's going on with the heart valve   And they said   Well the director of the company decided not to let you borrow this heart valve  because want his product to be associated with pigs.  Well  the last product from the book that I'm showing you is renewable energy    actually  to show that my first question  if pigs are still used up until the last bit  was still true. Well it is  because everything that can't be used for anything else is made into a fuel that can be used as renewable energy source. In total  I found     products. And what they showed me is that  well  firstly  it's at least to say odd that we don't treat these pigs as absolute kings and queens. And the second  is that we actually don't have a clue of what all these products that surround us are made of. And you might think I'm very fond of pigs  but actually    well  I am a little bit    but I'm more fond of raw materials in general. And I think that  in order to take better care of what's behind our products    so  the livestock  the crops  the plants  the non renewable materials  but also the people that produce these products    the first step would actually be to know that they are there. Thank you very much. Just a few minutes ago  I took this picture about    blocks from here. This is the Grand Cafe here in Oxford. I took this picture because this turns out to be the first coffeehouse to open in England in     . That's its great claim to fame  and I wanted to show it to you  not because I want to give you the kind of Starbucks tour of historic England  but rather because the English coffeehouse was crucial to the development and spread of one of the great intellectual flowerings of the last     years  what we now call the Enlightenment. And the coffeehouse played such a big role in the birth of the Enlightenment  in part  because of what people were drinking there. Because  before the spread of coffee and tea through British culture  what people drank    both elite and mass folks drank    day in and day out  from dawn until dusk was alcohol. Alcohol was the daytime beverage of choice. You would drink a little beer with breakfast and have a little wine at lunch  a little gin    particularly around         and top it off with a little beer and wine at the end of the day. That was the healthy choice    right    because the water wasn't safe to drink. And so  effectively until the rise of the coffeehouse  you had an entire population that was effectively drunk all day. And you can imagine what that would be like  right  in your own life    and I know this is true of some of you    if you were drinking all day  and then you switched from a depressant to a stimulant in your life  you would have better ideas. You would be sharper and more alert. And so it's not an accident that a great flowering of innovation happened as England switched to tea and coffee. But the other thing that makes the coffeehouse important is the architecture of the space. It was a space where people would get together from different backgrounds  different fields of expertise  and share. It was a space  as Matt Ridley talked about  where ideas could have sex. This was their conjugal bed  in a sense    ideas would get together there. And an astonishing number of innovations from this period have a coffeehouse somewhere in their story. I've been spending a lot of time thinking about coffeehouses for the last five years  because I've been kind of on this quest to investigate this question of where good ideas come from. What are the environments that lead to unusual levels of innovation  unusual levels of creativity  What's the kind of environmental    what is the space of creativity  And what I've done is I've looked at both environments like the coffeehouse  I've looked at media environments  like the world wide web  that have been extraordinarily innovative  I've gone back to the history of the first cities  I've even gone to biological environments  like coral reefs and rainforests  that involve unusual levels of biological innovation  and what I've been looking for is shared patterns  kind of signature behavior that shows up again and again in all of these environments. Are there recurring patterns that we can learn from  that we can take and kind of apply to our own lives  or our own organizations  or our own environments to make them more creative and innovative  And I think I've found a few. But what you have to do to make sense of this and to really understand these principles is you have to do away with a lot of the way in which our conventional metaphors and language steers us towards certain concepts of idea creation. We have this very rich vocabulary to describe moments of inspiration. We have the kind of the flash of insight  the stroke of insight  we have epiphanies  we have  eureka   moments  we have the lightbulb moments  right  All of these concepts  as kind of rhetorically florid as they are  share this basic assumption  which is that an idea is a single thing  it's something that happens often in a wonderful illuminating moment. But in fact  what I would argue and what you really need to kind of begin with is this idea that an idea is a network on the most elemental level. I mean  this is what is happening inside your brain. An idea    a new idea    is a new network of neurons firing in sync with each other inside your brain. It's a new configuration that has never formed before. And the question is  how do you get your brain into environments where these new networks are going to be more likely to form  And it turns out that  in fact  the kind of network patterns of the outside world mimic a lot of the network patterns of the internal world of the human brain. So the metaphor I'd like the use I can take from a story of a great idea that's quite recent    a lot more recent than the     s. A wonderful guy named Timothy Prestero  who has a company called ... an organization called Design That Matters. They decided to tackle this really pressing problem of  you know  the terrible problems we have with infant mortality rates in the developing world. One of the things that's very frustrating about this is that we know  by getting modern neonatal incubators into any context  if we can keep premature babies warm  basically    it's very simple    we can halve infant mortality rates in those environments. So  the technology is there. These are standard in all the industrialized worlds. The problem is  if you buy a         incubator  and you send it off to a mid sized village in Africa  it will work great for a year or two years  and then something will go wrong and it will break  and it will remain broken forever  because you don't have a whole system of spare parts  and you don't have the on the ground expertise to fix this         piece of equipment. And so you end up having this problem where you spend all this money getting aid and all these advanced electronics to these countries  and then it ends up being useless. So what Prestero and his team decided to do is to look around and see  what are the abundant resources in these developing world contexts  And what they noticed was they don't have a lot of DVRs  they don't have a lot of microwaves  but they seem to do a pretty good job of keeping their cars on the road. There's a Toyota Forerunner on the street in all these places. They seem to have the expertise to keep cars working. So they started to think   Could we build a neonatal incubator that's built entirely out of automobile parts   And this is what they ended up coming with. It's called a  neonurture device.  From the outside  it looks like a normal little thing you'd find in a modern  Western hospital. In the inside  it's all car parts. It's got a fan  it's got headlights for warmth  it's got door chimes for alarm    it runs off a car battery. And so all you need is the spare parts from your Toyota and the ability to fix a headlight  and you can repair this thing. Now  that's a great idea  but what I'd like to say is that  in fact  this is a great metaphor for the way that ideas happen. We like to think our breakthrough ideas  you know  are like that          brand new incubator  state of the art technology  but more often than not  they're cobbled together from whatever parts that happen to be around nearby. We take ideas from other people  from people we've learned from  from people we run into in the coffee shop  and we stitch them together into new forms and we create something new. That's really where innovation happens. And that means that we have to change some of our models of what innovation and deep thinking really looks like  right. I mean  this is one vision of it. Another is Newton and the apple  when Newton was at Cambridge. This is a statue from Oxford. You know  you're sitting there thinking a deep thought  and the apple falls from the tree  and you have the theory of gravity. In fact  the spaces that have historically led to innovation tend to look like this  right. This is Hogarth's famous painting of a kind of political dinner at a tavern  but this is what the coffee shops looked like back then. This is the kind of chaotic environment where ideas were likely to come together  where people were likely to have new  interesting  unpredictable collisions    people from different backgrounds. So  if we're trying to build organizations that are more innovative  we have to build spaces that    strangely enough    look a little bit more like this. This is what your office should look like  is part of my message here. And one of the problems with this is that people are actually    when you research this field    people are notoriously unreliable  when they actually kind of self report on where they have their own good ideas  or their history of their best ideas. And a few years ago  a wonderful researcher named Kevin Dunbar decided to go around and basically do the Big Brother approach to figuring out where good ideas come from. He went to a bunch of science labs around the world and videotaped everyone as they were doing every little bit of their job. So when they were sitting in front of the microscope  when they were talking to their colleague at the water cooler  and all these things. And he recorded all of these conversations and tried to figure out where the most important ideas  where they happened. And when we think about the classic image of the scientist in the lab  we have this image    you know  they're pouring over the microscope  and they see something in the tissue sample. And  oh  eureka   they've got the idea. What happened actually when Dunbar kind of looked at the tape is that  in fact  almost all of the important breakthrough ideas did not happen alone in the lab  in front of the microscope. They happened at the conference table at the weekly lab meeting  when everybody got together and shared their kind of latest data and findings  oftentimes when people shared the mistakes they were having  the error  the noise in the signal they were discovering. And something about that environment    and I've started calling it the  liquid network   where you have lots of different ideas that are together  different backgrounds  different interests  jostling with each other  bouncing off each other    that environment is  in fact  the environment that leads to innovation. The other problem that people have is they like to condense their stories of innovation down to kind of shorter time frames. So they want to tell the story of the  eureka   moment. They want to say   There I was  I was standing there and I had it all suddenly clear in my head.  But in fact  if you go back and look at the historical record  it turns out that a lot of important ideas have very long incubation periods    I call this the  slow hunch.  We've heard a lot recently about hunch and instinct and blink like sudden moments of clarity  but in fact  a lot of great ideas linger on  sometimes for decades  in the back of people's minds. They have a feeling that there's an interesting problem  but they don't quite have the tools yet to discover them. They spend all this time working on certain problems  but there's another thing lingering there that they're interested in  but they can't quite solve. Darwin is a great example of this. Darwin himself  in his autobiography  tells the story of coming up with the idea for natural selection as a classic  eureka   moment. He's in his study  it's October of       and he's reading Malthus  actually  on population. And all of a sudden  the basic algorithm of natural selection kind of pops into his head and he says   Ah  at last  I had a theory with which to work.  That's in his autobiography. About a decade or two ago  a wonderful scholar named Howard Gruber went back and looked at Darwin's notebooks from this period. And Darwin kept these copious notebooks where he wrote down every little idea he had  every little hunch. And what Gruber found was that Darwin had the full theory of natural selection for months and months and months before he had his alleged epiphany  reading Malthus in October of     . There are passages where you can read it  and you think you're reading from a Darwin textbook  from the period before he has this epiphany. And so what you realize is that Darwin  in a sense  had the idea  he had the concept  but was unable of fully thinking it yet. And that is actually how great ideas often happen  they fade into view over long periods of time. Now the challenge for all of us is  how do you create environments that allow these ideas to have this kind of long half life  right  It's hard to go to your boss and say   I have an excellent idea for our organization. It will be useful in     . Could you just give me some time to do that   Now a couple of companies    like Google    they have innovation time off     percent time  where  in a sense  those are hunch cultivating mechanisms in an organization. But that's a key thing. And the other thing is to allow those hunches to connect with other people's hunches  that's what often happens. You have half of an idea  somebody else has the other half  and if you're in the right environment  they turn into something larger than the sum of their parts. So  in a sense  we often talk about the value of protecting intellectual property  you know  building barricades  having secretive R D labs  patenting everything that we have  so that those ideas will remain valuable  and people will be incentivized to come up with more ideas  and the culture will be more innovative. But I think there's a case to be made that we should spend at least as much time  if not more  valuing the premise of connecting ideas and not just protecting them. And I'll leave you with this story  which I think captures a lot of these values  and it's just wonderful kind of tale of innovation and how it happens in unlikely ways. It's October of       and Sputnik has just launched  and we're in Laurel Maryland  at the applied physics lab associated with Johns Hopkins University. And it's Monday morning  and the news has just broken about this satellite that's now orbiting the planet. And of course  this is nerd heaven  right  There are all these physics geeks who are there thinking   Oh my gosh  This is incredible. I can't believe this has happened.  And two of them  two    something researchers at the APL are there at the cafeteria table having an informal conversation with a bunch of their colleagues. And these two guys are named Guier and Weiffenbach. And they start talking  and one of them says   Hey  has anybody tried to listen for this thing  There's this  you know  man made satellite up there in outer space that's obviously broadcasting some kind of signal. We could probably hear it  if we tune in.  And so they ask around to a couple of their colleagues  and everybody's like   No  I hadn't thought of doing that. That's an interesting idea.  And it turns out Weiffenbach is kind of an expert in microwave reception  and he's got a little antennae set up with an amplifier in his office. And so Guier and Weiffenbach go back to Weiffenbach's office  and they start kind of noodling around    hacking  as we might call it now. And after a couple of hours  they actually start picking up the signal  because the Soviets made Sputnik very easy to track. It was right at    MHz  so you could pick it up really easily  because they were afraid that people would think it was a hoax  basically. So they made it really easy to find it. So these two guys are sitting there listening to this signal  and people start kind of coming into the office and saying   Wow  that's pretty cool. Can I hear  Wow  that's great.  And before long  they think   Well jeez  this is kind of historic. We may be the first people in the United States to be listening to this. We should record it.  And so they bring in this big  clunky analog tape recorder and they start recording these little bleep  bleeps. And they start writing the kind of date stamp  time stamps for each little bleep that they record. And they they start thinking   Well gosh  you know  we're noticing small little frequency variations here. We could probably calculate the speed that the satellite is traveling  if we do a little basic math here using the Doppler effect.  And then they played around with it a little bit more  and they talked to a couple of their colleagues who had other kind of specialties. And they said   Jeez  you know  we think we could actually take a look at the slope of the Doppler effect to figure out the points at which the satellite is closest to our antennae and the points at which it's farthest away. That's pretty cool.  And eventually  they get permission    this is all a little side project that hadn't been officially part of their job description. They get permission to use the new  you know  UNIVAC computer that takes up an entire room that they'd just gotten at the APL. They run some more of the numbers  and at the end of about three or four weeks  turns out they have mapped the exact trajectory of this satellite around the Earth  just from listening to this one little signal  going off on this little side hunch that they'd been inspired to do over lunch one morning. A couple weeks later their boss  Frank McClure  pulls them into the room and says   Hey  you guys  I have to ask you something about that project you were working on. You've figured out an unknown location of a satellite orbiting the planet from a known location on the ground. Could you go the other way  Could you figure out an unknown location on the ground  if you knew the location of the satellite   And they thought about it and they said   Well  I guess maybe you could. Let's run the numbers here.  So they went back  and they thought about it. And they came back and said   Actually  it'll be easier.  And he said   Oh  that's great. Because see  I have these new nuclear submarines that I'm building. And it's really hard to figure out how to get your missile so that it will land right on top of Moscow  if you don't know where the submarine is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. So we're thinking  we could throw up a bunch of satellites and use it to track our submarines and figure out their location in the middle of the ocean. Could you work on that problem   And that's how GPS was born.    years later  Ronald Reagan actually opened it up and made it an open platform that anybody could kind of build upon and anybody could come along and build new technology that would create and innovate on top of this open platform  left it open for anyone to do pretty much anything they wanted with it. And now  I guarantee you certainly half of this room  if not more  has a device sitting in their pocket right now that is talking to one of these satellites in outer space. And I bet you one of you  if not more  has used said device and said satellite system to locate a nearby coffeehouse somewhere in the last    in the last day or last week  right  And that  I think  is a great case study  a great lesson in the power  the marvelous  kind of unplanned emergent  unpredictable power of open innovative systems. When you build them right  they will be led to completely new directions that the creators never even dreamed of. I mean  here you have these guys who basically thought they were just following this hunch  this little passion that had developed  then they thought they were fighting the Cold War  and then it turns out they're just helping somebody find a soy latte. That is how innovation happens. Chance favors the connected mind. Thank you very much. I want you to take a trip with me. Picture yourself driving down a small road in Africa  and as you drive along  you look off to the side  and this is what you see  you see a field of graves. And you stop  and you get out of your car and you take a picture. And you go into the town  and you inquire   What's going on here   and people are initially reluctant to tell you. And then someone says   These are the recent AIDS deaths in our community.  HIV isn't like other medical conditions  it's stigmatizing. People are reluctant to talk about it    there's a fear associated with it. And I'm going to talk about HIV today  about the deaths  about the stigma. It's a medical story  but more than that  it's a social story. This map depicts the global distribution of HIV. And as you can see  Africa has a disproportionate share of the infection. There are    million people living with HIV in the world today. Of these  two thirds     million are living in sub Saharan Africa. There are  .  million pregnant women in low  and middle income countries living with HIV and of these     percent are in sub Saharan Africa. We talk about things in relative terms. And I'm going to talk about annual pregnancies and HIV positive mothers. The United States    a large country    each year        mothers with HIV who give birth to a child. But you go to Rwanda    a very small country          mothers with HIV who are pregnant. And then you go to Baragwanath Hospital  outside of Johannesburg in South Africa  and       HIV positive pregnant women giving birth    a hospital the same as a country. And to realize that this is just the tip of an iceberg that when you compare everything here to South Africa  it just pales  because in South Africa  each year         mothers with HIV give birth to children. So we talk about PMTCT  and we refer to PMTCT  prevention of mother to child transmission. I think there's an assumption amongst most people in the public that if a mother is HIV positive  she's going to infect her child. The reality is really  very different. In resource rich countries  with all the tests and treatment we currently have  less than two percent of babies are born HIV positive       percent of babies are born HIV negative. And yet  the reality in resource poor countries  in the absence of tests and treatment     percent       percent of children are infected       percent versus two percent    an enormous difference. So these programs    and I'm going to refer to PMTCT though my talk    these prevention programs  simply  they're the tests and the drugs that we give to mothers to prevent them from infecting their babies  and also the medicines we give to mothers to keep them healthy and alive to raise their children. So it's the test a mother gets when she comes in. It's the drugs she receives to protect the baby that's inside the uterus and during delivery. It's the guidance she gets around infant feeding and safer sex. It's an entire package of services  and it works. So in the United States  since the advent of treatment in the middle of the     s  there's been an    percent decline in the number of HIV infected children. Less than     babies are born with HIV each year in the United States and yet  still  over         children are born every year in the world today with HIV. What does that mean  It means       children infected each day          children each day  infected with HIV. And where do they come from  Well  less than one comes from the United States. One  on average  comes from Europe.     come from Asia and the Pacific. And each day  a thousand babies    a thousand babies are born each day with HIV in Africa. So again  I look at the globe here and the disproportionate share of HIV in Africa. And let's look at another map. And here  again  we see Africa has a disproportionate share of the numbers of doctors. That thin sliver you see here  that's Africa. And it's the same with nurses. The truth is sub Saharan Africa has    percent of the global disease burden and yet only three percent of the world's health care workers. That means doctors and nurses simply don't have the time to take care of patients. A nurse in a busy clinic will see    to     patients in a day  which leaves her just minutes per patient    minutes per patient. And so when we look at these PMTCT programs  what does it mean  Well  back in       when there was just a simple test and a single dose of a drug  a nurse  in the course of her few minutes with a patient  would have to counsel for the HIV test  perform the HIV test  explain the results  dispense a single dose of the drug  Nevirapine  explain how to take it  discuss infant feeding options  reinforce infant feeding  and test the baby    in minutes. Well  fortunately since       we've got new treatments  new tests  and we're far more successful  but we don't have any more nurses. And so these are the tests a nurse now has to do in those same few minutes. It's not possible    it doesn't work. And so we need to find better ways of providing care. This is a picture of a maternal health clinic in Africa    mothers coming  pregnant and with their babies. These women are here for care  but we know that just doing a test  just giving someone a drug  it's not enough. Meds don't equal medical care. Doctors and nurses  frankly  don't have the time or skills to tell people what to do in ways they understand. I'm a doctor    I tell people things to do  and I expect them to follow my guidance    because I'm a doctor  I went to Harvard    but the reality is  if I tell a patient   You should have safer sex. You should always use a condom   and yet  in her relationship  she's not empowered    what's going to happen  If I tell her to take her medicines every day and yet  no one in the household knows about her illness  so it's just not going to work. And so we need to do more  we need to do it differently  we need to do it in ways that are affordable and accessible and can be taken to scale  which means it can be done everywhere. So  I want to tell you a story    I want to take you on a little trip. Imagine yourself  if you can  you're a young woman in Africa  you're going to the hospital or clinic. You go in for a test and you find out that you're pregnant  and you're delighted. And then they give you another test and they tell you you're HIV positive  and you're devastated. And the nurse takes you into a room  and she tells you about the tests and HIV and the medicines you can take and how to take care of yourself and your baby  and you hear none of it. All you're hearing is   I'm going to die  and my baby is going to die.  And then you're out on the street  and you don't know where to go. And you don't know who you can talk to  because the truth is  HIV is so stigmatizing that if you partner  your family  anyone in your home  you're likely to be thrown out without any means of support. And this    this is the face and story of HIV in Africa today. But we're here to talk about possible solutions and some good news. And I want to change the story a little bit. Take the same mother  and the nurse  after she gives her her test  takes her to a room. The door opens and there's a room full of mothers  mothers with babies  and they're sitting  and they're talking  they're listening. They're drinking tea  they're having sandwiches. And she goes inside  and woman comes up to her and says   Welcome to mothers mothers. Have a seat. You're safe here. We're all HIV positive. You're going to be okay. You're going to live. Your baby is going to be HIV negative.  We view mothers as a community's single greatest resource. Mothers take care of the children  take care of the home. So often the men are gone. They're working  or they're not part of the household. Our organization  mothers mothers  enlists women with HIV as care providers. We bring mothers who have HIV  who've been through these PMTCT programs in the very facilities  to come back and work side by side with doctors and nurses as part of the health care team. These mothers  we call them mentor mothers  are able to engage women who  just like themselves  pregnant with babies  have found out about being HIV positive  who need support and education. And they support them around the diagnosis and educate them about how to take their medicines  how to take care of themselves  how to take care of their babies. Consider  if you needed surgery  you would want the best possible technical surgeon  right  But if you wanted to understand what that surgery would do to your life  you'd like to engage someone  someone who's had the procedure. Patients are experts on their own experience  and they can share that experience with others. This is the medical care that goes beyond just medicines. So the mothers who work for us  they come from the communities in which they work. They're hired    they're paid as professional members of the health care teams  just like doctors and nurses. And we open bank accounts for them and they're paid directly into the accounts  because their money's protected  the men can't take it away from them. They go through two to three weeks of rigorous curriculum based education  training. Now  doctors and nurses    they too get trained. But so often  they only get trained once  so they're not aware of new medicines  new guidelines as they come out. Our mentor mothers get trained every single year and retrained. And so doctors and nurses    they look up to them as experts. Imagine that  a woman  a former patient  being able to educate her doctor for the first time and educate the other patients that she's taking care of. Our organization has three goals. The first  to prevent mother to child transmission. The second  keep mothers healthy  keep mothers alive  keep the children alive    no more orphans. And the third  and maybe the most grand  is to find ways to empower women  enable them to fight the stigma and to live positive and productive lives with HIV. So how do we do it  Well  maybe the most important engagement is the one to one  seeing patients one to one  educating them  supporting them  explaining how they can take care of themselves. We go beyond that  we try to bring in the husbands  the partners. In Africa  it's very  very hard to engage men. Men are not frequently part of pregnancy care. But in Rwanda  in one country  they've got a policy that a woman can't come for care unless she brings the father of the baby with her    that's the rule. And so the father and the mother  together  go through the counseling and the testing. The father and the mother  together  they get the results. And this is so important in breaking through the stigma. Disclosure is so central to prevention. How do you have safer sex  how do you use a condom regularly if there hasn't been disclosure  Disclosure is so important to treatment  because again  people need the support of family members and friends to take their medicines regularly. We also work in groups. Now the groups  it's not like me lecturing  but what happens is women  they come together    under the support and guidance of our mentor mothers    they come together  and they share their personal experiences. And it's through the sharing that people get tactics of how to take care of themselves  how to disclose how to take medicines. And then there's the community outreach  engaging women in their communities. If we can change the way households believe and think  we can change the way communities believe and think. And if we can change enough communities  we can change national attitudes. We can change national attitudes to women and national attitudes to HIV. The hardest barrier really is around stigma reduction. We have the medicines  we have the tests  but how do you reduce the stigma  And it's important about disclosure. So  a couple years ago  one of the mentor mothers came back  and she told me a story. She had been asked by one of the clients to go to the home of the client  because the client wanted to tell the mother and her brothers and sisters about her HIV status  and she was afraid to go by herself. And so the mentor mother went along with. And the patient walked into the house and said to her mother and siblings   I have something to tell you. I'm HIV positive.  And everybody was quiet. And then her oldest brother stood up and said   I too have something to tell you. I'm HIV positive. I've been afraid to tell everybody.  And then this older sister stood up and said   I too am living with the virus  and I've been ashamed.  And then her younger brother stood up and said   I'm also positive. I thought you were going to throw me out of the family.  And you see where this is going. The last sister stood up and said   I'm also positive. I thought you were going to hate me.  And there they were  all of them together for the first time being able to share this experience for the first time and to support each other for the first time. and they are crying and scared. I tell them my story  that I am HIV positive  but my child is HIV negative. I tell them   You are going to make it  and you will raise a healthy baby.  I am proof that there is hope. Mitchell Besser  Remember the images I showed you of how few doctors and nurses there are in Africa. And it is a crisis in health care systems. Even as we have more tests and more drugs  we can't reach people  we don't have enough providers. So we talk in terms of what we call task shifting. Task shifting is traditionally when you take health care services from one provider and have another provider do it. Typically  it's a doctor giving a job to a nurse. And the issue in Africa is that there are fewer nurses  really than doctors  and so we need to find new paradigm for health care. How do you build a better health care system  We've chosen to redefine the health care system as a doctor  a nurse and a mentor mother. And so what nurses do is that they ask the mentor mothers to explain how to take the drugs  the side effects. They delegate education about infant feeding  family planning  safer sex  actions that nurses simple just don't have time for. So we go back to the prevention of mother to child transmission. The world is increasingly seeing these programs as the bridge to comprehensive maternal and child health. And our organization helps women across that bridge. The care doesn't stop when the baby's born    we deal with the ongoing health of the mother and baby  ensuring that they live healthy  successful lives. Our organization works on three levels. The first  at the patient level    mothers and babies keeping babies from getting HIV  keeping mothers healthy to raise them. The second  communities    empowering women. They become leaders within their communities. They change the way communities think    we need to change attitudes to HIV. We need to change attitudes to women in Africa. We have to do that. And then rework the level of the health care systems  building stronger health care systems. Our health care systems are broken. They're not going to work the way they're currently designed. And so doctors and nurses who need to try to change people's behaviors don't have the skills  don't have the time    our mentor mothers do. And so in redefining the health care teams by bringing the mentor mothers in  we can do that. I started the program in Capetown  South Africa back in     . It was at that point  just the spark of an idea. Referencing Steven Johnson's very lovely speech yesterday on where ideas come from  I was in the shower at the time    I was alone. The program is now working in nine countries  we have     program sites  we're seeing about         women every month  we're employing       mentor mothers  and last year  they enrolled         HIV positive pregnant women and mothers. That is    percent of the global HIV positive pregnant women       percent of the world. What's extraordinary is how simple the premise is. Mothers with HIV caring for mothers with HIV. Past patients taking care of present patients. And empowerment through employment    reducing stigma. hope that one day we shall win this fight against HIV and AIDS. Each person must know their HIV status. Those who are HIV negative must know how to stay negative. Those who are HIV infected must know how to take care of themselves. HIV positive pregnant women must get PMTCT services in order to have HIV negative babies. All of this is possible  if we each contribute to this fight. MB  Simple solutions to complex problems. Mothers caring for mothers. It's transformational. Thank you. I'm going to share with you the story as to how I have become an HIV AIDS campaigner. And this is the name of my campaign  SING Campaign. In November of       I was invited to take part in the launch of Nelson Mandela's       Foundation    that is his HIV AIDS foundation. And       is the number that Mandela had when he was imprisoned in Robben Island. And that's me with Youssou N'Dour  onstage  having the time of my life. The next day  all the artists were invited to join Mandela in Robben Island  where he was going to give a conference to the world's press  standing in front of his former prison cell. You can see the bars of the window there. It was quite a momentous occasion for all of us. In that moment in time  Mandela told the world's press that there was a virtual genocide taking place in his country  that post apartheid Rainbow Nation  a thousand people were dying on a daily basis and that the front line victims  the most vulnerable of all  were women and children. This was a huge impact on my mind  because I am a woman and I am a mother  and I hadn't realized that the HIV AIDS pandemic was directly affecting women in such a way. And so I committed    when I left South Africa  when I left Capetown  I told myself   This is going to be something that I have to talk about. I have to serve.  And so  subsequently I participated in every single       event that I could take part in and gave news conferences  interviews  talking and using my platform as a musician  with my commitment to Mandela    out of respect for the tremendous  unbelievable work that he had done. Everyone in the world respects Nelson Mandela  everyone reveres Nelson Mandela. But do they all know about what has been taking place in South Africa  his country  the country that had one of the highest incidents of transmission of the virus  I think that if I went out into the street now and I told people what was happening there  they would be shocked. I was very  very fortunate a couple of years later to have met Zackie Achmat  the founder of Treatment Action Campaign  an incredible campaigner and activist. I met him at a       event. He was wearing a t shirt like the one I wear now. This is a tool    this tells you I am in solidarity with people who have HIV  people who are living with HIV. And in a way because of the stigma  by wearing this t shirt I say   Yes  we can talk about this issue. It doesn't have to be in the closet.  I became a member of Treatment Action Campaign and I'm very proud to be a member of that incredible organization. It's a grassroots campaign with    percent membership being women  most of whom are HIV positive. They work in the field. They have tremendous outreach to the people who are living directly with the effects of the virus. They have education programs. They bring out the issues of stigma. It's quite extraordinary what they do. And yes  my SING Campaign has supported Treatment Action Campaign in the way that I have tried to raise awareness and to try to also raise funds. A lot of the funding that I have managed to raise has gone directly to Treatment Action Campaign and the incredible work that they do  and are still continuing to do in South Africa. So this is my SING Campaign. SING Campaign is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to support me. I've traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years    I went to about    different countries. Here I am in Oslo in Norway  getting a nice  fat check  singing in Hong Kong  trying to get people to raise money. In Johannesburg  I had the opportunity to play to a mainly white  middle class South African audience who ended up in tears because I use film clips that really touch the heart  the whole nature  of this terrible tragedy that is taking place  that people are tending to avoid  because they are fatigued  and they really don't quite know what the solutions are. Aaron Motsoaledi  the current health minister  attended that concert and I had an opportunity to meet with him  and he gave his absolute commitment to try to making a change  which is absolutely necessary. This is in the Scottish Parliament. I've subsequently become an envoy for Scotland and HIV. And I was showing them my experiences and trying to  again  raise awareness. And once again  in Edinburgh with the wonderful African Children's Choir who I simply adore. And it's children like this  many of whom have been orphaned because of their family being affected by the AIDS virus. I'm sitting here in New York with Michel Sidibe    he's the director of UNAIDS. And I'm very honored by the fact that Michel invited me  only a few months ago  to become a UNAIDS ambassador. And in this way  I've been strengthening my platform and broadening my outreach. The message that UNAIDS are currently sending out to the world is that we would like to see the virtual elimination of the transmission of the virus from mother to child by     . It's a very ambitious goal but we believe it can be achieved with political will. This can happen. And here I am with a pregnant woman  who is HIV positive and we're smiling  both of us are smiling  because we're very confident  because we know that that young woman is receiving treatment so her life can be extended to take care of the baby she's about to give birth to. And her baby will receive PMTCT  which will mean that that baby can be born free of the virus. Now that is prevention at the very beginning of life. It's one way to start looking at intervention with the AIDS pandemic. Now  I just would like to finish off to tell you the little story about Avelile. This is Avelile    she goes with me wherever I go. I tell her story to everyone because she represents one of millions of HIV AIDS orphans. Avelile's mother had HIV virus    she died from AIDS related illness. Avelile had the virus  she was born with the virus. And here she is at seven years old  weighing no more than a one year old baby. At this point in her life  she's suffering with full blown AIDS and had pneumonia. We met her in a hospital in the Eastern Cape and spent a whole afternoon with her    an adorable child. The doctors and nurses were phenomenal. They put her on very special nutritious diet and took great care of her. And we didn't know when we left the hospital    because we filmed her story    we didn't know if she was going to survive. So  it was obviously    it was a very emotional encounter and left us feeling very resonant with this direct experience  this one child  you know  that story. Five months later  we went back to South Africa to meet Avelile again. And I'm getting    the hairs on my    I don't know if you can see the hairs on my arms. They're standing up because I know what I'm going to show you. This is the transformation that took place. Isn't it extraordinary  That round of applause is actually for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of Avelile. And I take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation. So  I would like to say to you  each one in the audience  if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have access to good nutrition and good medical care  and you believe that the Millennium Development Goals  specifically five and six  should be absolutely committed to by all governments around the world    especially in sub Saharan Africa    could you please stand up. I think that's fair to say  it's almost everyone in the hall. Thank you very much. I am a Ph.D. student and that means I have a question  how can we make digital content graspable  Because you see  on the one hand  there is the digital world and no question  many things are happening there right now. And for us humans  it's not quite material  it's not really there    it's virtual. On the other hand  we humans  we live in a physical world. It's rich  it tastes good  it feels good  it smells good. So the question is  how do we get the stuff over from the digital into the physical  That's my question. If you look at the iPhone with its touch and the Wii with its bodily activity  you can see the tendency  it's getting physical. The question is  what's next  Now  I have three options that I would like to show you. The first one is mass. As humans  we are sensitive to where an object in our hand is heavy. So  could we use that in mobile phones  Let me show you the weight shifting mobile. It is a mobile phone shaped box that has an iron weight inside  which we can move around  and you can feel where it's heavy. We shift the gravitational center of it. For example  we can augment digital content with physical mass. So you move around the content on a display  but you can also feel where it is just from the weight of the device. Another thing it's good for is navigation    it can guide you around in a city. It can tell you by its weight   Okay  move right. Walk ahead. Make a left here.  And the good thing about that is you don't have to look at the device all the time  you have your eyes free to see the city. Now  mass is the first thing  the second thing  that's shape. We're also sensitive to the shape of objects we have in  our  hands. So if I download an e book and it has    pages    well  they could be thin  right    but if it has     pages  I want to feel that  Harry Potter     it's thick.  Laughter  So let me show you the shape changing mobile. Again  it's a mobile phone shaped box  and this one can change its shape. We can play with the shape itself. For example  it can be thin in your pocket  which we of course want it to be  but then if you hold it in your hand  it can lean towards you  be thick. It's like tapered to the downside. If you change the grasp  it can adjust to that. It's also useful if you want to put it down on your nightstand to watch a movie or use as an alarm clock  it stands. It's fairly simple. Another thing is  sometimes we watch things on a mobile phone  they are bigger than the phone itself. So in that case    like here  there's an app that's bigger than the phone's screen    the shape of the phone could tell you   Okay  off the screen right here  there is more content. You can't see it  but it's there.  And you can feel that because it's thicker at that edge. The shape is the second thing. The third thing operates on a different level. As humans  we are social  we are empathic  and that's great. Wouldn't that be a way to make mobile phones more intuitive  Think of a hamster in the pocket. Well  I can feel it  it's doing all right    I don't have to check it. Let me show you the living mobile phone. So  once again  mobile phone shaped box  but this one  it has a breath and a heartbeat  and it feels very organic. And you can tell  it's relaxed right now. Oh now  missed call  a new call  new girlfriend maybe    very exciting.  Laughter  How do we calm it down  You give it a pat behind the ears  and everything is all right again. So  that's very intuitive  and that's what we want. So  what we have seen are three ways to make the digital graspable for us. And I think making it physical is a good way to do that. What's behind that is a postulation  namely that not humans should get much more technical in the future  rather than that  technology  a bit more human. The Hindus say   Nada brahma   one translation of which is   The world is sound.  And in a way  that's true  because everything is vibrating. In fact  all of you as you sit here right now are vibrating. Every part of your body is vibrating at different frequencies. So you are  in fact  a chord    each of you an individual chord. One definition of health may be that that chord is in complete harmony. Your ears can't hear that chord  they can actually hear amazing things. Your ears can hear    octaves. Incidentally  we see just one octave. Your ears are always on    you have no ear lids. They work even when you sleep. The smallest sound you can perceive moves your eardrum just four atomic diameters. The loudest sound you can hear is a trillion times more powerful than that. Ears are made not for hearing  but for listening. Listening is an active skill  whereas hearing is passive  listening is something that we have to work at    it's a relationship with sound. And yet it's a skill that none of us are taught. For example  have you ever considered that there are listening positions  places you can listen from  Here are two of them. Reductive listening is listening  for.  It reduces everything down to what's relevant and it discards everything that's not relevant. Men typically listen reductively. So he's saying   I've got this problem.  He's saying   Here's your solution. Thanks very much. Next.  That's the way we talk  right guys  Expansive listening  on the other hand  is listening  with   not listening  for.  It's got no destination in mind    it's just enjoying the journey. Women typically listen expansively. If you look at these two  eye contact  facing each other  possibly both talking at the same time. Men  if you get nothing else out of this talk  practice expansive listening  and you can transform your relationships. The trouble with listening is that so much of what we hear is noise  surrounding us all the time. Noise like this  according to the European Union  is reducing the health and the quality of life of    percent of the population of Europe. Two percent of the population of Europe    that's    million people    are having their sleep devastated by noise like that. Noise kills         people a year in Europe. It's a really big problem. Now  when you were little  if you had noise and you didn't want to hear it  you'd stick your fingers in your ears and hum. These days  you can do a similar thing  it just looks a bit cooler. It looks a bit like this. The trouble with widespread headphone use is it brings three really big health issues. The first really big health issue is a word that Murray Schafer coined   schizophonia.  It's a dislocation between what you see and what you hear. So  we're inviting into our lives the voices of people who are not present with us. I think there's something deeply unhealthy about living all the time in schizophonia. The second problem that comes with headphone abuse is compression. We squash music to fit it into our pocket and there is a cost attached to this. Listen to this    this is an uncompressed piece of music. And now the same piece of music with    percent of the data removed. I do hope that some of you at least can hear the difference between those two. There is a cost of compression. It makes you tired and irritable to have to make up all of that data. You're having to imagine it. It's not good for you in the long run. The third problem with headphones is this  deafness    noise induced hearing disorder. Ten million Americans already have this for one reason or another  but really worryingly     percent    roughly one in six    of American teenagers suffer from noise induced hearing disorder as a result of headphone abuse. One study at an American university found that    percent of college freshmen had damaged hearing as a result of headphone abuse. We may be raising an entire generation of deaf people. Now that's a really serious problem. I'll give you three quick tips to protect your ears and pass these on to your children  please. Professional hearing protectors are great  I use some all the time. If you're going to use headphones  buy the best ones you can afford because quality means you don't have to have it so loud. If you can't hear somebody talking to you in a loud voice  it's too loud. And thirdly  if you're in bad sound  it's fine to put your fingers in your ears or just move away from it. Protect your ears in that way. Let's move away from bad sound and look at some friends that I urge you to seek out. WWB  Wind  water  birds    stochastic natural sounds composed of lots of individual random events  all of it very healthy  all of it sound that we evolved to over the years. Seek those sounds out  they're good for you and so it this. Silence is beautiful. The Elizabethans described language as decorated silence. I urge you to move away from silence with intention and to design soundscapes just like works of art. Have a foreground  a background  all in beautiful proportion. It's fun to get into designing with sound. If you can't do it yourself  get a professional to do it for you. Sound design is the future  and I think it's the way we're going to change the way the world sounds. I'm going to just run quickly through eight modalities  eight ways sound can improve health. First  ultrasound  we're very familiar with it from physical therapy  it's also now being used to treat cancer. Lithotripsy    saving thousands of people a year from the scalpel by pulverizing stones with high intensity sound. Sound healing is a wonderful modality. It's been around for thousands of years. I do urge you to explore this. There are great things being done there  treating now autism  dementia and other conditions. And music  of course. Just listening to music is good for you  if it's music that's made with good intention  made with love  generally. Devotional music  good    Mozart  good. There are all sorts of types of music that are very healthy. And four modalities where you need to take some action and get involved. First of all  listen consciously. I hope that that after this talk you'll be doing that. It's a whole new dimension to your life and it's wonderful to have that dimension. Secondly  get in touch with making some sound    create sound. The voice is the instrument we all play  and yet how many of us are trained in using our voice  Get trained  learn to sing  learn to play an instrument. Musicians have bigger brains    it's true. You can do this in groups as well. It's a fantastic antidote to schizophonia  to make music and sound in a group of people  whichever style you enjoy particularly. And let's take a stewarding role for the sound around us. Protect your ears  Yes  absolutely. Design soundscapes to be beautiful around you at home and at work. And let's start to speak up when people are assailing us with the noise that I played you early on. So I'm going to leave you with seven things you can do right now to improve your health with sound. My vision is of a world that sounds beautiful and if we all start doing these things  we will take a very big step in that direction. So I urge you to take that path. I'm leaving you with a little more birdsong  which is very good for you. I wish you sound health. I got up this morning at      a.m. after going to sleep at       a.m. I was awakened once during the night. My heart rate was    beats per minute    my blood pressure      over   . I had zero minutes of exercise yesterday  so my maximum heart rate during exercise wasn't calculated. I had about     milligrams of caffeine  zero of alcohol. And my score on the Narcissism Personality Index  or the NPI     is a reassuring  .  . We know that numbers are useful for us when we advertise  manage  govern  search. I'm going to talk about how they're useful when we reflect  learn  remember and want to improve. A few years ago  Kevin Kelly  my partner  and I noticed that people were subjecting themselves to regimes of quantitative measurement and self tracking that went far beyond the ordinary  familiar habits such as stepping on a scale every day. People were tracking their food via Twitter  their kids' diapers on their iPhone. They were making detailed journals of their spending  their mood  their symptoms  their treatments. Now  we know some of the technological facts that are driving this change in our lifestyle    the uptake and diffusion of mobile devices  the exponential improvement in data storage and data processing  and the remarkable improvement in human biometric sensors. This little black dot there is a  D accelerometer. It tracks your movement through space. It is  as you can see  very small and also very cheap. They're now down to well under a dollar a piece  and they're going into all kinds of devices. But what's interesting is the incredible detailed information that you can get from just one sensor like this. This kind of sensor is in the hit biometric device    among early adopters at the moment    the Fitbit. This tracks your activity and also your sleep. It has just that sensor in it. You're probably familiar with the Nike  system. I just put it up because that little blue dot is the sensor. It's really just a pressure sensor like the kind that's in a doorbell. And Nike knows how to get your pace and distance from just that sensor. This is the strap that people use to transmit heart rate data to their Nike  system. This is a beautiful  new device that gives you detailed sleep tracking data  not just whether you're asleep or awake  but also your phase of sleep    deep sleep  light sleep  REM sleep. The sensor is just a little strip of metal in that headband there. The rest of it is the bedside console  just for reference  this is a sleep tracking system from just a few years ago    I mean  really until now. And this is the sleep tracking system of today. This just was presented at a health care conference in D.C. Most of what you see there is an asthma inhaler  but the top is a very small GPS transceiver  which gives you the date and location of an asthma incident  giving you a new awareness of your vulnerability in relation to time and environmental factors. Now  we know that new tools are changing our sense of self in the world    these tiny sensors that gather data in nature  the ubiquitous computing that allows that data to be understood and used  and of course the social networks that allow people to collaborate and contribute. But we think of these tools as pointing outward  as windows and I'd just like to invite you to think of them as also turning inward and becoming mirrors. So that when we think about using them to get some systematic improvement  we also think about how they can be useful for self improvement  for self discovery  self awareness  self knowledge. Here's a biometric device  a pair of Apple Earbuds. Last year  Apple filed some patents to get blood oxygenation  heart rate and body temperature via the Earbuds. What is this for  What should it be for  Some people will say it's for biometric security. Some people will say it's for public health research. Some people will say it's for avant garde marketing research. I'd like to tell you that it's also for self knowledge. And the self isn't the only thing  it's not even most things. The self is just our operation center  our consciousness  our moral compass. So  if we want to act more effectively in the world  we have to get to know ourselves better. Thank you. We live in in a remarkable time  the age of genomics. Your genome is the entire sequence of your DNA. Your sequence and mine are slightly different. That's why we look different. I've got brown eyes  you might have blue or gray. But it's not just skin deep. The headlines tell us that genes can give us scary diseases  maybe even shape our personality  or give us mental disorders. Our genes seem to have awesome power over our destinies. And yet  I would like to think that I am more than my genes. What do you guys think  Are you more than your genes  I think some people agree with me. I think we should make a statement. I think we should say it all together. All right   I'm more than my genes     all together. Everybody  I am more than my genes. Sebastian Seung  What am I  I am my connectome. Now  since you guys are really great  maybe you can humor me and say this all together too. Right. All together now. Everybody  I am my connectome. SS  That sounded great. You know  you guys are so great  you don't even know what a connectome is  and you're willing to play along with me. I could just go home now. Well  so far only one connectome is known  that of this tiny worm. Its modest nervous system consists of just     neurons. And in the     s and '  s  a team of scientists mapped all       connections between the neurons. In this diagram  every node is a neuron  and every line is a connection. This is the connectome of the worm C. elegans. Your connectome is far more complex than this because your brain contains     billion neurons and        times as many connections. There's a diagram like this for your brain  but there's no way it would fit on this slide. Your connectome contains one million times more connections than your genome has letters. That's a lot of information. What's in that information  We don't know for sure  but there are theories. Since the   th century  neuroscientists have speculated that maybe your memories    the information that makes you  you    maybe your memories are stored in the connections between your brain's neurons. And perhaps other aspects of your personal identity    maybe your personality and your intellect    maybe they're also encoded in the connections between your neurons. And so now you can see why I proposed this hypothesis  I am my connectome. I didn't ask you to chant it because it's true  I just want you to remember it. And in fact  we don't know if this hypothesis is correct  because we have never had technologies powerful enough to test it. Finding that worm connectome took over a dozen years of tedious labor. And to find the connectomes of brains more like our own  we need more sophisticated technologies  that are automated  that will speed up the process of finding connectomes. And in the next few minutes  I'll tell you about some of these technologies  which are currently under development in my lab and the labs of my collaborators. Now you've probably seen pictures of neurons before. You can recognize them instantly by their fantastic shapes. They extend long and delicate branches  and in short  they look like trees. But this is just a single neuron. In order to find connectomes  we have to see all the neurons at the same time. So let's meet Bobby Kasthuri  who works in the laboratory of Jeff Lichtman at Harvard University. Bobby is holding fantastically thin slices of a mouse brain. And we're zooming in by a factor of         times to obtain the resolution  so that we can see the branches of neurons all at the same time. Except  you still may not really recognize them  and that's because we have to work in three dimensions. If we take many images of many slices of the brain and stack them up  we get a three dimensional image. And still  you may not see the branches. So we start at the top  and we color in the cross section of one branch in red  and we do that for the next slice and for the next slice. And we keep on doing that  slice after slice. If we continue through the entire stack  we can reconstruct the three dimensional shape of a small fragment of a branch of a neuron. And we can do that for another neuron in green. And you can see that the green neuron touches the red neuron at two locations  and these are what are called synapses. Let's zoom in on one synapse  and keep your eyes on the interior of the green neuron. You should see small circles    these are called vesicles. They contain a molecule know as a neurotransmitter. And so when the green neuron wants to communicate  it wants to send a message to the red neuron  it spits out neurotransmitter. At the synapse  the two neurons are said to be connected like two friends talking on the telephone. So you see how to find a synapse. How can we find an entire connectome  Well  we take this three dimensional stack of images and treat it as a gigantic three dimensional coloring book. We color every neuron in  in a different color  and then we look through all of the images  find the synapses and note the colors of the two neurons involved in each synapse. If we can do that throughout all the images  we could find a connectome. Now  at this point  you've learned the basics of neurons and synapses. And so I think we're ready to tackle one of the most important questions in neuroscience  how are the brains of men and women different  According to this self help book  guys brains are like waffles  they keep their lives compartmentalized in boxes. Girls' brains are like spaghetti  everything in their life is connected to everything else. You guys are laughing  but you know  this book changed my life. But seriously  what's wrong with this  You already know enough to tell me    what's wrong with this statement  It doesn't matter whether you're a guy or girl  everyone's brains are like spaghetti. Or maybe really  really fine capellini with branches. Just as one strand of spaghetti contacts many other strands on your plate  one neuron touches many other neurons through their entangled branches. One neuron can be connected to so many other neurons  because there can be synapses at these points of contact. By now  you might have sort of lost perspective on how large this cube of brain tissue actually is. And so let's do a series of comparisons to show you. I assure you  this is very tiny. It's just six microns on a side. So  here's how it stacks up against an entire neuron. And you can tell that  really  only the smallest fragments of branches are contained inside this cube. And a neuron  well  that's smaller than brain. And that's just a mouse brain    it's a lot smaller than a human brain. So when show my friends this  sometimes they've told me   You know  Sebastian  you should just give up. Neuroscience is hopeless.  Because if you look at a brain with your naked eye  you don't really see how complex it is  but when you use a microscope  finally the hidden complexity is revealed. In the   th century  the mathematician and philosopher  Blaise Pascal  wrote of his dread of the infinite  his feeling of insignificance at contemplating the vast reaches of outer space. And  as a scientist  I'm not supposed to talk about my feelings    too much information  professor. But may I  I feel curiosity  and I feel wonder  but at times I have also felt despair. Why did I choose to study this organ that is so awesome in its complexity that it might well be infinite  It's absurd. How could we even dare to think that we might ever understand this  And yet  I persist in this quixotic endeavor. And indeed  these days I harbor new hopes. Someday  a fleet of microscopes will capture every neuron and every synapse in a vast database of images. And some day  artificially intelligent supercomputers will analyze the images without human assistance to summarize them in a connectome. I do not know  but I hope that I will live to see that day  because finding an entire human connectome is one of the greatest technological challenges of all time. It will take the work of generations to succeed. At the present time  my collaborators and I  what we're aiming for is much more modest    just to find partial connectomes of tiny chunks of mouse and human brain. But even that will be enough for the first tests of this hypothesis that I am my connectome. For now  let me try to convince you of the plausibility of this hypothesis  that it's actually worth taking seriously. As you grow during childhood and age during adulthood  your personal identity changes slowly. Likewise  every connectome changes over time. What kinds of changes happen  Well  neurons  like trees  can grow new branches  and they can lose old ones. Synapses can be created  and they can be eliminated. And synapses can grow larger  and they can grow smaller. Second question  what causes these changes  Well  it's true. To some extent  they are programmed by your genes. But that's not the whole story  because there are signals  electrical signals  that travel along the branches of neurons and chemical signals that jump across from branch to branch. These signals are called neural activity. And there's a lot of evidence that neural activity is encoding our thoughts  feelings and perceptions  our mental experiences. And there's a lot of evidence that neural activity can cause your connections to change. And if you put those two facts together  it means that your experiences can change your connectome. And that's why every connectome is unique  even those of genetically identical twins. The connectome is where nature meets nurture. And it might true that just the mere act of thinking can change your connectome    an idea that you may find empowering. What's in this picture  A cool and refreshing stream of water  you say. What else is in this picture  Do not forget that groove in the Earth called the stream bed. Without it  the water would not know in which direction to flow. And with the stream  I would like to propose a metaphor for the relationship between neural activity and connectivity. Neural activity is constantly changing. It's like the water of the stream  it never sits still. The connections of the brain's neural network determines the pathways along which neural activity flows. And so the connectome is like bed of the stream  but the metaphor is richer than that  because it's true that the stream bed guides the flow of the water  but over long timescales  the water also reshapes the bed of the stream. And as I told you just now  neural activity can change the connectome. And if you'll allow me to ascend to metaphorical heights  I will remind you that neural activity is the physical basis    or so neuroscientists think    of thoughts  feelings and perceptions. And so we might even speak of the stream of consciousness. Neural activity is its water  and the connectome is its bed. So let's return from the heights of metaphor and return to science. Suppose our technologies for finding connectomes actually work. How will we go about testing the hypothesis  I am my connectome   Well  I propose a direct test. Let us attempt to read out memories from connectomes. Consider the memory of long temporal sequences of movements  like a pianist playing a Beethoven sonata. According to a theory that dates back to the   th century  such memories are stored as chains of synaptic connections inside your brain. Because  if the first neurons in the chain are activated  through their synapses they send messages to the second neurons  which are activated  and so on down the line  like a chain of falling dominoes. And this sequence of neural activation is hypothesized to be the neural basis of those sequence of movements. So one way of trying to test the theory is to look for such chains inside connectomes. But it won't be easy  because they're not going to look like this. They're going to be scrambled up. So we'll have to use our computers to try to unscramble the chain. And if we can do that  the sequence of the neurons we recover from that unscrambling will be a prediction of the pattern of neural activity that is replayed in the brain during memory recall. And if that were successful  that would be the first example of reading a memory from a connectome. What a mess    have you ever tried to wire up a system as complex as this  I hope not. But if you have  you know it's very easy to make a mistake. The branches of neurons are like the wires of the brain. Can anyone guess  what's the total length of wires in your brain  I'll give you a hint. It's a big number. I estimate  millions of miles  all packed in your skull. And if you appreciate that number  you can easily see there is huge potential for mis wiring of the brain. And indeed  the popular press loves headlines like   Anorexic brains are wired differently   or  Autistic brains are wired differently.  These are plausible claims  but in truth  we can't see the brain's wiring clearly enough to tell if these are really true. And so the technologies for seeing connectomes will allow us to finally read mis wiring of the brain  to see mental disorders in connectomes. Sometimes the best way to test a hypothesis is to consider its most extreme implication. Philosophers know this game very well. If you believe that I am my connectome  I think you must also accept the idea that death is the destruction of your connectome. I mention this because there are prophets today who claim that technology will fundamentally alter the human condition and perhaps even transform the human species. One of their most cherished dreams is to cheat death by that practice known as cryonics. If you pay         dollars  you can arrange to have your body frozen after death and stored in liquid nitrogen in one of these tanks in an Arizona warehouse  awaiting a future civilization that is advanced to resurrect you. Should we ridicule the modern seekers of immortality  calling them fools  Or will they someday chuckle over our graves  I don't know    I prefer to test their beliefs  scientifically. I propose that we attempt to find a connectome of a frozen brain. We know that damage to the brain occurs after death and during freezing. The question is  has that damage erased the connectome  If it has  there is no way that any future civilization will be able to recover the memories of these frozen brains. Resurrection might succeed for the body  but not for the mind. On the other hand  if the connectome is still intact  we cannot ridicule the claims of cryonics so easily. I've described a quest that begins in the world of the very small  and propels us to the world of the far future. Connectomes will mark a turning point in human history. As we evolved from our ape like ancestors on the African savanna  what distinguished us was our larger brains. We have used our brains to fashion ever more amazing technologies. Eventually  these technologies will become so powerful that we will use them to know ourselves by deconstructing and reconstructing our own brains. I believe that this voyage of self discovery is not just for scientists  but for all of us. And I'm grateful for the opportunity to share this voyage with you today. Thank you. So I want to tell you a story    an encouraging story    about addressing desperation  depression and despair in Afghanistan  and what we have learned from it  and how to help people to overcome traumatic experiences and how to help them to regain some confidence in the time ahead    in the future    and how to participate again in everyday life. So  I am a Jungian psychoanalyst  and I went to Afghanistan in January       by chance  on an assignment for Medica Mondiale. Jung in Afghanistan    you get the picture. Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world  and    percent of the people are illiterate. War and malnutrition kills people together with hope. You may know this from the media  but what you may not know is that the average age of the Afghan people is    years old  which means they grow up in such an environment and    I repeat myself    in    years of war. So this translates into ongoing violence  foreign interests  bribery  drugs  ethnic conflicts  bad health  shame  fear and cumulative traumatic experiences. Local and foreign military are supposed to build peace together with the donors and the governmental and non governmental organizations. And people had hope  yes  but until they realized their situation worsens every day    either because they are being killed or because  somehow  they are poorer than eight years ago. One figure for that     percent of the children under the age of five years suffer from malnutrition. Yet  there is hope. One day a man told me   My future does not look brilliant  but I want to have a brilliant future for my son.  This is a picture I took in       walking on Fridays over the hills in Kabul  and for me it's a symbolic picture of an open future for a young generation. So  doctors prescribe medication. And donors are supposed to bring peace by building schools and roads. Military collect weapons  and depression stays intact. Why  Because people don't have tools to cope with it  to get over it. So  soon after my arrival  I had confirmed something which I had already known  that my instruments come from the heart of modern Europe  yes. However  what can wound us and our reaction to those wounds    they are universal. And the big challenge was how to understand the meaning of the symptom in this specific cultural context. After a counseling session  a woman said to me   Because you have felt me  I can feel myself again  and I want to participate again in my family life.  This was very important  because the family is central in Afghans' social system. No one can survive alone. And if people feel used  worthless and ashamed  because something horrible has happened to them  then they retreat  and they fall into social isolation  and they do not dare to tell this evil to other people or to their loved ones  because they do not want to burden them. And very often violence is a way to cope with it. Traumatized people also easily lose control    symptoms are hyper arousal and memory flashbacks    so people are in a constant fear that those horrible feelings of that traumatic event might come back unexpectedly  suddenly  and they cannot control it. To compensate this loss of inner control  they try to control the outside  very understandably    mostly the family    and unfortunately  this fits very well into the traditional side  regressive side  repressive side  restrictive side of the cultural context. So  husbands start beating wives  mothers and fathers beat their children  and afterward  they feel awful. They did not want to do this  it just happened    they lost control. The desperate try to restore order and normality  and if we are not able to cut this circle of violence  it will be transferred to the next generation without a doubt. And partly this is already happening. So everybody needs a sense for the future  and the Afghan sense of the future is shattered. But let me repeat the words of the woman.  Because you have felt me  I can feel myself again.  So the key here is empathy. Somebody has to be a witness to what has happened to you. Somebody has to feel how you felt. And somebody has to see you and listen to you. Everybody must be able to know what he or she has experienced is true  and this only goes with another person. So everybody must be able to say   This happened to me  and it did this with me  but I'm able to live with it  to cope with it  and to learn from it. And I want to engage myself in the bright future for my children and the children of my children  and I will not marry off my    year old daughter      what happens too often in Afghanistan. So something can be done  even in such extreme environments as Afghanistan. And I started thinking about a counseling program. But  of course  I needed help and funds. And one evening  I was sitting next to a very nice gentleman in Kabul  and he asked what I thought would be good in Afghanistan. And I explained to him quickly  I would train psycho social counselors  I would open centers  and I explained to him why. This man gave me his contact details at the end of the evening and said   If you want to do this  call me.  At that time  it was the head of Caritas Germany. So  I was able to launch a three year project with Caritas Germany  and we trained    Afghan women and men  and we opened    counseling centers in Kabul. This was our sign    it's hand painted  and we had    all over Kabul. Eleven thousand people came    more than that. And    percent regained their lives. This was a very exciting time  developing this with my wonderful Afghan team. And they are working with me up to today. We developed a culturally sensitive psycho social counseling approach. So  from      up until today  a substantial change and step forward has been taking place. The European Union delegation in Kabul came into this and hired me to work inside the Ministry of Public Health  to lobby this approach    we succeeded. We revised the mental health component of the primary health care services by adding psycho social care and psycho social counselors to the system. This means  certainly  to retrain all health staff. But for that  we already have the training manuals  which are approved by the Ministry and moreover  this approach is now part of the mental health strategy in Afghanistan. So we also have implemented it already in some selected clinics in three provinces  and you are the first to see the results. We wanted to know if what is being done is effective. And here you can see the patients all had symptoms of depression  moderate and severe. And the red line is the treatment as usual    medication with a medical doctor. And all the symptoms stayed the same or even got worse. And the green line is treatment with psycho social counseling only  without medication. And you can see the symptoms almost completely go away  and the psycho social stress has dropped significantly  which is explicable  because you cannot take away the psycho social stresses  but you can learn how to cope with them. So this makes us very happy  because now we also have some evidence that this is working. So here you see  this is a health facility in Northern Afghanistan  and every morning it looks like this all over. And doctors usually have three to six minutes for the patients  but now this will change. They go to the clinics  because they want to cure their immediate symptoms  and they will find somebody to talk to and discuss these issues and talk about what is burdening them and find solutions  develop their resources  learn tools to solve their family conflicts and gain some confidence in the future. And I would like to share one short vignette. One Hazara said to his Pashtun counselor   If we were to have met some years ago  then we would have killed each other. And now you are helping me to regain some confidence in the future.  And another counselor said to me after the training   You know  I never knew why I survived the killings in my village  but now I know  because I am part of a nucleus of a new peaceful society in Afghanistan.  So I believe this kept me running. And this is a really emancipatory and political contribution to peace and reconciliation. And also    I think    without psycho social therapy  and without considering this in all humanitarian projects  we cannot build up civil societies. I thought it was an idea worth spreading  and I think it must be  can be  could be replicated elsewhere. I thank you for your attention. Welcome to Thailand. Now  when I was a young man       years ago  the country was very  very poor with lots and lots and lots of people living in poverty. We decided to do something about it  but we didn't begin with a welfare program or a poverty reduction program. But we began with a family planning program  following a very successful maternal child health activity  sets of activities. So basically  no one would accept family planning if their children didn't survive. So the first step  get to the children  get to the mothers  and then follow up with family planning. Not just child mortality alone  you need also family planning. Now let me take you back as to why we needed to do it. In my country  that was the case in     . Seven children per family    tremendous growth at  .  percent. There was just no future. We needed to reduce the population growth rate. So we said   Let's do it.  The women said   We agree. We'll use pills  but we need a doctor to prescribe the pills   and we had very  very few doctors. We didn't take no as an answer  we took no as a question. We went to the nurses and the midwives  who were also women  and did a fantastic job at explaining how to use the pill. That was wonderful  but it covered only    percent of the country. What do we do for the other    percent    leave them alone and say   Well  they're not medical personnel.  No  we decided to do a bit more. So we went to the ordinary people that you saw. Actually  below that yellow sign    I wish they hadn't wiped that  because there was  Coca Cola  there. We were so much bigger than Coca Cola in those days. And no difference  the people they chose were the people we chose. They were well known in the community  they knew that customers were always right  and they were terrific  and they practiced their family planning themselves. So they could supply pills and condoms throughout the country  in every village of the country. So there we are. We went to the people who were seen as the cause of the problem to be the solution. Wherever there were people    and you can see boats with the women  selling things    here's the floating market selling bananas and crabs and also contraceptives    wherever you find people  you'll find contraceptives in Thailand. And then we decided  why not get to religion because in the Philippines  the Catholic Church was pretty strong  and Thai people were Buddhist. We went to them and they said   Look  could you help us   I'm there    the one in blue  not the yellow    holding a bowl of holy water for the monk to sprinkle holy water on pills and condoms for the sanctity of the family. And this picture was sent throughout the country. So some of the monks in the villages were doing the same thing themselves. And the women were saying   No wonder we have no side effects. It's been blessed.  That was their perception. And then we went to teachers. You need everybody to be involved in trying to provide whatever it is that make humanity a better place. So we went to the teachers. Over a quarter of a million were taught about family planning with a new alphabet    A  B for birth  C for condom  I for IUD  V for vasectomy. And then we had a snakes and ladders game  where you throw dice. If you land on anything pro family planning  you move ahead. Like   Mother takes the pill every night. Very good  mother. Move ahead. Uncle buys a condom. Very good  uncle. Move ahead. Uncle gets drunk  doesn't use condom. Come back  start again.  Again  education  class entertainment. And the kids were doing it in school too. We had relay races with condoms  we had children's condom blowing championship. And before long  the condom was know as the girl's best friend. In Thailand  for poor people  diamonds don't make it    so the condom is the girl's best friend. We introduced our first microcredit program in       and the women who organized it said   We only want to lend to women who practice family planning. If you're pregnant  take care of your pregnancy. If you're not pregnant  you can take a loan out from us.  And that was run by them. And after       years  it's still going on. It's a part of the Village Development Bank  it's not a real bank  but it's a fund    microcredit. And we didn't need a big organization to run it    it was run by the villagers themselves. And you probably hardly see a Thai man there  it's always women  women  women  women. And then we thought we'd help America  because America's been helping everyone  whether they want help or not. And this is on the Fourth of July. We decided to provide vasectomy to all men  but in particular  American men to the front of the queue  right up to the Ambassador's residence during his  unclear . And the hotel gave us the ballroom for it    very appropriate room. And since it was near lunch time  they said   All right  we'll give you some lunch. Of course  it must be American cola. You get two brands  Coke and Pepsi. And then the food is either hamburger or hotdog.  And I thought a hotdog will be more symbolic. And here is this  then  young man called Willy Bohm who worked for the USAID. Obviously  he's had his vasectomy because his hotdog is half eaten  and he was very happy. It made a lot of news in America  and it angered some people also. I said   Don't worry. Come over and I'll do the whole lot of you.  And what happened  In all this thing  from seven children to  .  children  population growth rate of  .  to  . . You could call it the Coca Cola approach if you like    it was exactly the same thing. I'm not sure whether Coca Cola followed us  or we followed Coca Cola  but we're good friends. And so that's the case of everyone joining in. We didn't have a strong government. We didn't have lots of doctors. But it's everybody's job who can change attitude and behavior. Then AIDS came along and hit Thailand  and we had to stop doing a lot of good things to fight AIDS. But unfortunately  the government was in denial  denial  denial. So our work wasn't affected. So I thought   Well  if you can't go to the government  go to the military.  So I went to the military and asked to borrow     radio stations. They have more than the government  and they've got more guns than the government. So I asked them  could they help us in our fight against HIV. And after I gave them statistics  they said   Yes. Okay. You can use all the radio stations  television stations.  And that's when we went onto the airwaves. And then we got a new prime minister soon after that. And he said   Mechai  could you come and join   He asked me in because he liked my wife a lot. So I said   Okay.  He became the chairman of the National AIDS Committee and increased the budget fifty fold. Every ministry  even judges  had to be involved in AIDS education    everyone    and we said the public  institutions  religious institutions  schools    everyone was involved. And here  every media person had to be trained for HIV. And we gave every station half a minute extra for advertising to earn more money. So they were happy with that. And then AIDS education in all schools  starting from university. And these are high school kids teaching high school kids. And the best teachers were the girls  not the boys  and they were terrific. And these girls who go around teaching about safe sex and HIV were known as Mother Theresa. And then we went down one more step. These are primary school kids    third  fourth grade    going to every household in the village  every household in the whole of Thailand  giving AIDS information and a condom to every household  given by these young kids. And no parents objected  because we were trying to save lives  and this was a lifesaver. And we said   Everyone needs to be involved.  So you have the companies also realizing that sick staff don't work  and dead customers don't buy. So they all trained. And then we have this Captain Condom  with his Harvard MBA  going to schools and night spots. And they loved him. You need a symbol of something. In every country  every program  you need a symbol  and this is probably the best thing he's ever done with his MBA. And then we gave condoms out everywhere on the streets    everywhere  everywhere. In taxis  you get condoms. And also  in traffic  the policemen give you condoms    our  cops and rubbers  programs. So  can you imagine New York policemen giving out condoms  Of course I can. And they'd enjoy it immensely  I see them standing around right now  everywhere. Imagine if they had condoms  giving out to all sorts of people. And then  new change  we had hair bands  clothing and the condom for your mobile phone during the rainy season. And these were the condoms that we introduced. One says   Weapon of mass protection.  We found    you know    somebody here was searching for the weapon of mass destruction  but we have found the weapon of mass protection  the condom. And then it says here  with the American flag   Don't leave home without it.  But I have some to give out afterward. But let me warn you  these are Thai sized  so be very careful. And so you can see that condoms can do so many things. Look at this    I gave this to Al Gore and to Bill Senior also. Stop global warming  use condoms. And then this is the picture I mentioned to you    the weapon of mass protection. And let the next Olympics save some lives. Why just run around  And then finally  in Thailand we're Buddhist  we don't have a God  so instead  we say   In rubber we trust.  So you can see that we added everything to our endeavor to make life better for the people. We had condoms in all the refrigerators in the hotels and the schools  because alcohol impairs judgment. And then what happened  After all this time  everybody joined in. According to the U.N.  new cases of HIV declined by    percent  and according to the World Bank   .  million lives were saved. Otherwise there wouldn't be many Thais walking around today. So it just showed you  you could do something about it.    percent of the funding came from Thailand. There was political commitment  some financial commitment  and everybody joined in the fight. So just don't leave it to the specialists and doctors and nurses. We all need to help. And then we decided to help people out of poverty  now that we got AIDS somewhat out of the way    this time  not with government alone  but in cooperation with the business community. Because poor people are business people who lack business skills and access to credit. Those are the things to be provided by the business community. We're trying to turn them into barefoot entrepreneurs  little business people. The only way out of poverty is through business enterprise. So  that was done. The money goes from the company into the village via tree planting. It's not a free gift. They plant the trees  and the money goes into their microcredit fund  which we call the Village Development Bank. Everybody joins in  and they feel they own the bank  because they have brought the money in. And before you can borrow the money  you need to be trained. And we believe if you want to help the poor  those who are living in poverty  access to credit must be a human right. Access to credit must be a human right. Otherwise they'll never get out of poverty. And then before getting a loan  you must be trained. Here's what we call a  barefoot MBA   teaching people how to do business so that  when they borrow money  they'll succeed with the business. These are some of the businesses  mushrooms  crabs  vegetables  trees  fruits  and this is very interesting    Nike ice cream and Nike biscuits  this is a village sponsored by Nike. They said   They should stop making shoes and clothes. Make these better  because we can afford them.  And then we have silk  Thai silk. Now we're making Scottish tartans  as you can see on the left  to sell to all people of Scottish ancestors. So anyone sitting in and watching TV  get in touch with me. And then this is our answer to Starbucks in Thailand     Coffee and Condoms.  See  Starbucks you awake  we keep you awake and alive. That's the difference. Can you imagine  at every Starbucks that you can also get condoms  You can order your condoms with your with your cappuccino. And then now  finally in education  we want to change the school as being underutilized into a place where it's a lifelong learning center for everyone. We call this our School Based Integrated Rural Development. And it's a center  a focal point for economic and social development. Re do the school  make it serve the community needs. And here is a bamboo building    all of them are bamboo. This is a geodesic dome made of bamboo. And I'm sure Buckminster Fuller would be very  very proud to see a bamboo geodesic dome. And we use vegetables around the school ground  so they raise their own vegetables. And then  finally  I firmly believe  if we want the MDGs to work    the Millennium Development Goals    we need to add family planning to it. Of course  child mortality first and then family planning    everyone needs family planning service    it's underutilized. So we have now found the weapon of mass protection. And we also ask the next Olympics to be involved in saving lives. And then  finally  that is our network. And these are our Thai tulips. Thank you very much indeed.
