Everybody talks about happiness these days. I had somebody count the number of books with  happiness  in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about     and there were many more. There is a huge wave of interest in happiness  among researchers. There is a lot of happiness coaching. Everybody would like to make people happier. But in spite of all this flood of work  there are several cognitive traps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness. And my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps. This applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness  and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness  because it turns out we're just as messed up as anybody else is. The first of these traps is a reluctance to admit complexity. It turns out that the word  happiness  is just not a useful word anymore  because we apply it to too many different things. I think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it  but by and large  this is something that we'll have to give up and we'll have to adopt the more complicated view of what well being is. The second trap is a confusion between experience and memory  basically  it's between being happy in your life  and being happy about your life or happy with your life. And those are two very different concepts  and they're both lumped in the notion of happiness. And the third is the focusing illusion  and it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance that affects well being without distorting its importance. I mean  this is a real cognitive trap. There's just no way of getting it right. Now  I'd like to start with an example of somebody who had a question and answer session after one of my lectures reported a story  and that was a story    He said he'd been listening to a symphony  and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording  there was a dreadful screeching sound. And then he added  really quite emotionally  it ruined the whole experience. But it hadn't. What it had ruined were the memories of the experience. He had had the experience. He had had    minutes of glorious music. They counted for nothing because he was left with a memory  the memory was ruined  and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep. What this is telling us  really  is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves. There is an experiencing self  who lives in the present and knows the present  is capable of re living the past  but basically it has only the present. It's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches    you know  when the doctor asks   Does it hurt now when I touch you here   And then there is a remembering self  and the remembering self is the one that keeps score  and maintains the story of our life  and it's the one that the doctor approaches in asking the question   How have you been feeling lately   or  How was your trip to Albania   or something like that. Those are two very different entities  the experiencing self and the remembering self  and getting confused between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness. Now  the remembering self is a storyteller. And that really starts with a basic response of our memories    it starts immediately. We don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories. Our memory tells us stories  that is  what we get to keep from our experiences is a story. And let me begin with one example. This is an old study. Those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure. I won't go into detail. It's no longer painful these days  but it was painful when this study was run in the     s. They were asked to report on their pain every    seconds. Here are two patients  those are their recordings. And you are asked   Who of them suffered more   And it's a very easy question. Clearly  Patient B suffered more    his colonoscopy was longer  and every minute of pain that Patient A had  Patient B had  and more. But now there is another question   How much did these patients think they suffered   And here is a surprise. The surprise is that Patient A had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy than Patient B. The stories of the colonoscopies were different  and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends. And neither of these stories is very inspiring or great    but one of them is this distinct ...  Laughter  but one of them is distinctly worse than the other. And the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end  it's a bad story. How do we know that  Because we asked these people after their colonoscopy  and much later  too   How bad was the whole thing  in total   And it was much worse for A than for B  in memory. Now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self. From the point of view of the experiencing self  clearly  B had a worse time. Now  what you could do with Patient A  and we actually ran clinical experiments  and it has been done  and it does work    you could actually extend the colonoscopy of Patient A by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much. That will cause the patient to suffer  but just a little and much less than before. And if you do that for a couple of minutes  you have made the experiencing self of Patient A worse off  and you have the remembering self of Patient A a lot better off  because now you have endowed Patient A with a better story about his experience. What defines a story  And that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us  and it's also true of the stories that we make up. What defines a story are changes  significant moments and endings. Endings are very  very important and  in this case  the ending dominated. Now  the experiencing self lives its life continuously. It has moments of experience  one after the other. And you can ask  What happens to these moments  And the answer is really straightforward  They are lost forever. I mean  most of the moments of our life    and I calculated  you know  the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long  that means that  you know  in a life there are about     million of them  in a month  there are about            most of them don't leave a trace. Most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self. And yet  somehow you get the sense that they should count  that what happens during these moments of experience is our life. It's the finite resource that we're spending while we're on this earth. And how to spend it would seem to be relevant  but that is not the story that the remembering self keeps for us. So we have the remembering self and the experiencing self  and they're really quite distinct. The biggest difference between them is in the handling of time. From the point of view of the experiencing self  if you have a vacation  and the second week is just as good as the first  then the two week vacation is twice as good as the one week vacation. That's not the way it works at all for the remembering self. For the remembering self  a two week vacation is barely better than the one week vacation because there are no new memories added. You have not changed the story. And in this way  time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from an experiencing self  time has very little impact on the story. Now  the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories. It is actually the one that makes decisions because  if you have a patient who has had  say  two colonoscopies with two different surgeons and is deciding which of them to choose  then the one that chooses is the one that has the memory that is less bad  and that's the surgeon that will be chosen. The experiencing self has no voice in this choice. We actually don't choose between experiences  we choose between memories of experiences. And even when we think about the future  we don't think of our future normally as experiences. We think of our future as anticipated memories. And basically you can look at this  you know  as a tyranny of the remembering self  and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn't need. I have that sense that when we go on vacations this is very frequently the case  that is  we go on vacations  to a very large extent  in the service of our remembering self. And this is a bit hard to justify I think. I mean  how much do we consume our memories  That is one of the explanations that is given for the dominance of the remembering self. And when I think about that  I think about a vacation we had in Antarctica a few years ago  which was clearly the best vacation I've ever had  and I think of it relatively often  relative to how much I think of other vacations. And I probably have consumed my memories of that three week trip  I would say  for about    minutes in the last four years. Now  if I had ever opened the folder with the     pictures in it  I would have spent another hour. Now  that is three weeks  and that is at most an hour and a half. There seems to be a discrepancy. Now  I may be a bit extreme  you know  in how little appetite I have for consuming memories  but even if you do more of this  there is a genuine question  Why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences  So I want you to think about a thought experiment. Imagine that for your next vacation  you know that at the end of the vacation all your pictures will be destroyed  and you'll get an amnesic drug so that you won't remember anything. Now  would you choose the same vacation   Laughter  And if you would choose a different vacation  there is a conflict between your two selves  and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict  and it's actually not at all obvious  because if you think in terms of time  then you get one answer  and if you think in terms of memories  you might get another answer. Why do we pick the vacations we do is a problem that confronts us with a choice between the two selves. Now  the two selves bring up two notions of happiness. There are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply  one per self. So you can ask  How happy is the experiencing self  And then you would ask  How happy are the moments in the experiencing self's life  And they're all    happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process. What are the emotions that can be measured  And  by the way  now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time. If you ask for the happiness of the remembering self  it's a completely different thing. This is not about how happily a person lives. It is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life. Very different notion. Anyone who doesn't distinguish those notions is going to mess up the study of happiness  and I belong to a crowd of students of well being  who've been messing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way. The distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years  and there are now efforts to measure the two separately. The Gallup Organization has a world poll where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences  and there have been other efforts along those lines. So in recent years  we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two selves. And the main lesson I think that we have learned is they are really different. You can know how satisfied somebody is with their life  and that really doesn't teach you much about how happily they're living their life  and vice versa. Just to give you a sense of the correlation  the correlation is about . . What that means is if you met somebody  and you were told   Oh his father is six feet tall   how much would you know about his height  Well  you would know something about his height  but there's a lot of uncertainty. You have that much uncertainty. If I tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten  you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing self. So the correlation is low. We know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self. We know that money is very important  goals are very important. We know that happiness is mainly being satisfied with people that we like  spending time with people that we like. There are other pleasures  but this is dominant. So if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves  you are going to end up doing very different things. The bottom line of what I've said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitute for well being. It is a completely different notion. Now  very quickly  another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not attend to the same things when we think about life  and we actually live. So  if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California  you are not going to get to the correct answer. When you ask that question  you think people must be happier in California if  say  you live in Ohio. And what happens is when you think about living in California  you are thinking of the contrast between California and other places  and that contrast  say  is in climate. Well  it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and it's not even very important to the reflective self that decides how happy people are. But now  because the reflective self is in charge  you may end up    some people may end up moving to California. And it's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to California in the hope of getting happier. Well  their experiencing self is not going to get happier. We know that. But one thing will happen  They will think they are happier  because  when they think about it  they'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in Ohio  and they will feel they made the right decision. It is very difficult to think straight about well being  and I hope I have given you a sense of how difficult it is. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Thank you. I've got a question for you. Thank you so much. Now  when we were on the phone a few weeks ago  you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that Gallup survey. Is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now  Daniel Kahneman  Sure. I think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup survey is a number  which we absolutely did not expect to find. We found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self. When we looked at how feelings  vary with income. And it turns out that  below an income of        dollars a year  for Americans    and that's a very large sample of Americans  like          so it's a large representative sample    below an income of         dollars a year... CA        . DK        .        dollars a year  people are unhappy  and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get. Above that  we get an absolutely flat line. I mean I've rarely seen lines so flat. Clearly  what is happening is money does not buy you experiential happiness  but lack of money certainly buys you misery  and we can measure that misery very  very clearly. In terms of the other self  the remembering self  you get a different story. The more money you earn  the more satisfied you are. That does not hold for emotions. CA  But Danny  the whole American endeavor is about life  liberty  the pursuit of happiness. If people took seriously that finding  I mean  it seems to turn upside down everything we believe about  like for example  taxation policy and so forth. Is there any chance that politicians  that the country generally  would take a finding like that seriously and run public policy based on it  DK  You know I think that there is recognition of the role of happiness research in public policy. The recognition is going to be slow in the United States  no question about that  but in the U.K.  it is happening  and in other countries it is happening. People are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public policy. It's going to take a while  and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness  or whether they want to study life evaluation  so we need to have that debate fairly soon. How to enhance happiness goes very different ways depending on how you think  and whether you think of the remembering self or you think of the experiencing self. This is going to influence policy  I think  in years to come. In the United States  efforts are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population. This is going to be  I think  within the next decade or two  part of national statistics. CA  Well  it seems to me that this issue will    or at least should be    the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years. Thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics. Thank you  Danny Kahneman. So  what I'm going to do is just give you the latest episode of India's    maybe the world's    longest running soap opera  which is cricket. And may it run forever  because it gives people like me a living. It's got everything that you'd want a normal soap opera to want  It's got love  joy  happiness  sadness  tears  laughter  lots of deceit  intrigue. And like all good soaps  it jumps    years when the audience interest changes. And that's exactly what cricket has done. It's jumped    years into    over game. And that's what I'm going to talk about  how a small change leads to a very big revolution. But it wasn't always like that. Cricket wasn't always this speed driven generations game. There was a time when you played cricket  you played timeless test matches  when you played on till the game got over. And there was this game in March      that started on the third of March and ended on the   th of March. And it only ended because the English cricketers had to go from Durban to Cape Town  which is a two hour train journey  to catch the ship that left on the   th  because the next ship wasn't around for a long time. So  the match was ended in between. And one of the English batsmen said   You know what  Another half an hour and we would have won.  Another half an hour after    days. There were two Sundays in between. But of course  Sundays are church days  so you don't play on Sundays. And one day it rained  so they all sat around making friends with each other. But there is a reason why India fell in love with cricket  because we had about the same pace of life. The Mahabharata was like that as well  wasn't it  You fought by day  then it was sunset  so everyone went back home. And then you worked out your strategy  and you came and fought the next day  and you went back home again. The only difference between the Mahabharata and our cricket was that in cricket  everybody was alive to come back and fight the next day. Princes patronize the game  not because they love the game  but because it was a means of ingratiating themselves to the British rulers. But there is one other reason why India fell in love with cricket  which was  all you needed was a plank of wood and a rubber ball  and any number of people could play it anywhere. Take a look  You could play it in the dump with some rocks over there  you could play it in a little alley    you couldn't hit square anywhere  because the bat hit the wall  don't forget the air conditioning and the cable wires. You could play it on the banks of the Ganges    that's as clean as the Ganges has been for a long time. Or you could play many games in one small patch of land  even if you didn't know which game you were actually in. As you can see  you can play anywhere. But slowly the game moved on  you know  finally. You don't always have five days. So  we moved on  and we started playing    over cricket. And then an enormous accident took place. In Indian sport we don't make things happen  accidents happen and we're in the right place at the right time  sometimes. And we won this World Cup in     . And suddenly we fell in love with the    over game  and we played it virtually every day. There was more    over cricket than anywhere. But there was another big date.      was when we won the World Cup.      '    we found a finance minister and a prime minister willing to let the world look at India  rather than be this great country of intrigue and mystery in this closed country. And so we allowed multinationals into India. We cut customs duties  we reduced import duties  and we got all the multinationals coming in  with multinational budgets  who looked at per capita income and got very excited about the possibilities in India  and were looking for a vehicle to reach every Indian. And there are only two vehicles in India    one real  one scripted. The scripted one is what you see in the movies  the real one was cricket. And so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me  Ravi Dhariwal from Pepsi  decided he's going to take it all over the world. And Pepsi was this big revolution  because they started taking cricket all over. And so cricket started becoming big  cricket started bringing riches in. Television started covering cricket. For a long time television said   We won't cover cricket unless you pay us to cover it.  Then they said   OK  the next rights are sold for    million dollars. The next rights are sold for     million dollars.  So  it's a bit of a curve  that. And then another big accident happened in our cricket. England invented    overs cricket  and said   The world must play    overs cricket.  Just as England invented cricket  and made the rest of the world play it. Thank God for them. And so  India had to go and play the T   World Cup  you see. India didn't want to play the T   World Cup. But we were forced to play it by an     margin. And then something very dramatic happened. We got to the final  and then this moment  that will remain enshrined forever  for everybody  take a look. The Pakistani batsman trying to clear the fielder. Announcer  And Zishan takes it  India wins  What a match for a Twenty   final. India  the world champions. India  T   champions. But what a game we had  M. S. Dhoni got it right in the air  but Misbah ul Haq  what a player. A massive  massive success  India  the world TT champions. Harsha Bhogle  Suddenly India discovered this power of    overs cricket. The accident  of course  there  was that the batsman thought the bowler was bowling fast. If he had bowled fast  the ball would have gone where it was meant to go  but it didn't go. And we suddenly discovered that we could be good at this game. And what it also did was it led to a certain pride in the fact that India could be the best in the world. It was at a time when investment was coming in  India was feeling a little more confident about itself. And so there was a feeling that there was great pride in what we can do. And thankfully for all of us  the English are very good at inventing things  and then the gracious people that they are  they let the world become very good at it. And so England invented T   cricket  and allowed India to hijack it. It was not like reengineering that we do in medicine  we just took it straight away  as is. And so  we launched our own T   league. Six weeks  city versus city. It was a new thing for us. We had only ever supported our country    the only two areas in which India was very proud about their country  representing itself on the field. One was war  the Indian army  which we don't like to happen very often. The other was Indian cricket. Now  suddenly we had to support city leagues. But the people getting into these city leagues were people who were taking their cues from the West. America is a home of leagues. And they said   Right  we'll build some glitzy leagues here in India.  But was India ready for it  Because cricket  for a long time in India was always organized. It was never promoted  it was never sold    it was organized. And look what they did with our beautiful  nice  simple family game. All of a sudden  you had that happening. An opening ceremony to match every other. This was an India that was buying Corvettes. This was an India that was buying Jaguar. This was an India that was adding more mobile phones per month than New Zealand's population twice over. So  it was a different India. But it was also a slightly more orthodox India that was very happy to be modern  but didn't want to say that to people. And so  they were aghast when the cheerleaders arrived. Everyone secretly watched them  but everyone claimed not to. The new owners of Indian cricket were not the old princes. They were not bureaucrats who were forced into sport because they didn't actually love it  these were people who ran serious companies. And so they started promoting cricket big time  started promoting clubs big time. And they've started promoting them with huge money behind it. I mean the IPL had  .  billion dollars before a ball was bowled   .  billion dollars for television revenue over    years  and another    million dollars plus from all these franchises that were putting in money. And then they had to appeal to their cities  but they had to do it like the West  right  Because we are setting up leagues. But what they were very good at doing was making it very localized. So  just to give you an example of how they did it    not Manchester United style promotion  but very Mumbai style promotion. Take a look. Of course  a lot of people said   Maybe they dance better than they play.  But that's all right. What it did also is it changed the way we looked at cricket. All along  if you wanted a young cricketer  you picked him up from the bylanes of your own little locality  your own city  and you were very proud of the system that produced those cricketers. Now  all of the sudden  if you were to bowl a shot    if Mumbai were to bowl a shot  for example  they needn't go to Kalbadevi or Shivaji Park or somewhere to source them  they could go to Trinidad. This was the new India  wasn't it  This was the new world  where you can source from anywhere as long as you get the best product at the best price. And all of a sudden  Indian sport had awakened to the reality that you can source the best product for the best price anywhere in the world. So  the Mumbai Indians flew in Dwayne Bravo from Trinidad and Tobago  overnight. And when he had to go back to represent the West Indies  they asked him   When do you have to reach   He said   I have to be there by a certain time  so I have to leave today.  We said   No  no  no. It's not about when you have to leave  it's about when do you have to reach there   And so he said   I've got to reach on date X.  And they said   Fine  you play to date X  minus one.  So  he played in Hyderabad  went  straight after the game  went from the stadium to Hyderabad airport  sat in a private corporate jet    first refueling in Portugal  second refueling in Brazil  he was in West Indies in time. Never would India have thought on this scale before. Never would India have said   I want a player to play one game for me  and I will use a corporate jet to send him all the way back to Kingston  Jamaica to play a game.  And I just thought to myself   Wow  we've arrived somewhere in the world  you know  We have arrived somewhere. We are thinking big.  But what this also did was it started marrying the two most important things in Indian cricket  which is cricket and the movies in Indian entertainment. There is cricket and the movies. And they came together because people in the movies now started owning clubs. And so  people started going to the cricket to watch Preity Zinta. They started going to the cricket to watch Shah Rukh Khan. And something very interesting happened. We started getting song and dance in Indian cricket. And so it started resembling the Indian movies more and more. And of course  if you were on Preity Zinta's team    as you will see on the clip that follows    if you did well  you got a hug from Preity Zinta. So that was the ultimate reason to do well. Take a look    everyone's watching Preity Zinta. And then of course there was Shah Rukh playing the Kolkata crowd. We'd all seen matches in Kolkata  but we'd never seen anything like this  Shah Rukh  with the Bengali song  getting the audiences all worked up for Kolkata    not for India  but for Kolkata. But take a look at this. An Indian film star hugging a Pakistani cricketer because they'd won in Kolkata. Can you imagine  And do you know what the Pakistani cricketer said   I wish I was playing for Preity Zinta's team.  But I thought I'd take this opportunity    there's a few people from Pakistan in here. I'm so happy that you're here because I think we can show that we can both be together and be friends  right  We can play cricket together  we can be friends. So thank you very much for coming  all of you from Pakistan. There was criticism too because they said   Players are being bought and sold  Are they grain  Are they cattle   Because we had this auction  you see. How do you fix a price for a player  And so the auction that followed literally had people saying   Bang  so many million dollars for so and so player.  There it is. Auctioneer  Going at           dollars. Chennai. Shane Warne sold for         dollars. HB  Suddenly  a game which earned its players    rupees a day    so     rupees for a test match  but if you finish in four days you only got    . The best Indian players who played every test match    every one of the internationals  the top of the line players    standard contracts are         dollars in a whole year. Now they were getting         for six days' work. Then Andrew Flintoff came by from England  he got one and a half million dollars  and he went back and said   For four weeks  I'm earning more than Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard  and I'm earning more than the footballers  wow.  And where was he earning it from  From a little club in India. Could you have imagined that day would come  One and a half million dollars for six weeks' work. That's not bad  is it  So  at  .  billion dollars before the first ball was bowled. What India was doing  though  was benchmarking itself against the best in the world  and it became a huge brand. Lalit Modi was on the cover of Business Today. IPL became the biggest brand in India and  because our elections  had to be moved to South Africa  and we had to start the tournament in three weeks. Move a whole tournament to South Africa in three weeks. But we did it. You know why  Because no country works as slowly as we do till three weeks before an event  and nobody works fast as we do in the last three weeks. Our population  which for a long time we thought was a problem  suddenly became our biggest asset because there were more people watching    the huge consuming class    everybody came to watch the cricket. We'd also made cricket the only sport in India  which is a pity  but in India every other sport pushes cricket to become big  which is a bit of a tragedy of our times. Now  this last minute before I go    there's a couple of side effects of all this. For a long time  India was this country of poverty  dust  beggars  snake charmers  filth  Delhi belly    people heard Delhi belly stories before they came. And  all of a sudden  India was this land of opportunity. Cricketers all over the world said   You know  we love India. We love to play in India.  And that felt good  you know  We said   The dollar's quite powerful actually.  Can you imagine  you've got the dollar on view and there's no Delhi belly in there anymore. There's no filth  there's no beggars  all the snake charmers have vanished  everybody's gone. This tells you how the capitalist world rules. Right so  finally  an English game that India usurped a little bit  but T   is going to be the next missionary in the world. If you want to take the game around the world  it's got to be the shortest form of the game. You can't take a timeless test to China and sit through    days with no result in the end  or you can't take it all over the world. So that's what T   is doing. Hopefully  it'll make everyone richer  hopefully it'll make the game bigger and hopefully it'll give cricket commentators more time in the business. Thank you very much. Thank you. If I can leave you with one big idea today  it's that the whole of the data in which we consume is greater that the sum of the parts  and instead of thinking about information overload  what I'd like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns pop and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible. So what we're looking at right here is a typical mortality chart organized by age. This tool that I'm using here is a little experiment. It's called Pivot  and with Pivot what I can do is I can choose to filter in one particular cause of deaths    say  accidents. And  right away  I see there's a different pattern that emerges. This is because  in the mid area here  people are at their most active  and over here they're at their most frail. We can step back out again and then reorganize the data by cause of death  seeing that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects  but not for everyone. If we go ahead and we filter by age    say    years or less    we see that accidents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about. And if you drill into that  it's especially the case for men. So you get the idea that viewing information  viewing data in this way  is a lot like swimming in a living information info graphic. And if we can do this for raw data  why not do it for content as well  So what we have right here is the cover of every single Sports Illustrated ever produced. It's all here  it's all on the web. You can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk. With Pivot  you can drill into a decade. You can drill into a particular year. You can jump right into a specific issue. So I'm looking at this  I see the athletes that have appeared in this issue  the sports. I'm a Lance Armstrong fan  so I'll go ahead and I'll click on that  which reveals  for me  all the issues in which Lance Armstrong's been a part of. Now  if I want to just kind of take a peek at these  I might think   Well  what about taking a look at all of cycling   So I can step back  and expand on that. And I see Greg LeMond now. And so you get the idea that when you navigate over information this way    going narrower  broader  backing in  backing out    you're not searching  you're not browsing. You're doing something that's actually a little bit different. It's in between  and we think it changes the way information can be used. So I want to extrapolate on this idea a bit with something that's a little bit crazy. What we're done here is we've taken every single Wikipedia page and we reduced it down to a little summary. So the summary consists of just a little synopsis and an icon to indicate the topical area that it comes from. I'm only showing the top     most popular Wikipedia pages right here. But even in this limited view  we can do a lot of things. Right away  we get a sense of what are the topical domains that are most popular on Wikipedia. I'm going to go ahead and select government. Now  having selected government  I can now see that the Wikipedia categories that most frequently correspond to that are Time magazine People of the Year. So this is really important because this is an insight that was not contained within any one Wikipedia page. It's only possible to see that insight when you step back and look at all of them. Looking at one of these particular summaries  I can then drill into the concept of Time magazine Person of the Year  bringing up all of them. So looking at these people  I can see that the majority come from government  some have come from natural sciences  some  fewer still  have come from business    there's my boss    and one has come from music. And interestingly enough  Bono is also a TED Prize winner. So we can go  jump  and take a look at all the TED Prize winners. So you see  we're navigating the web for the first time as if it's actually a web  not from page to page  but at a higher level of abstraction. And so I want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise. I'm just showing the New York Times website here. So Pivot  this application    I don't want to call it a browser  it's really not a browser  but you can view web pages with it    and we bring that zoomable technology to every single web page like this. So I can step back  pop right back into a specific section. Now the reason why this is important is because  by virtue of just viewing web pages in this way  I can look at my entire browsing history in the exact same way. So I can drill into what I've done over specific time frames. Here  in fact  is the state of all the demo that I just gave. And I can sort of replay some stuff that I was looking at earlier today. And  if I want to step back and look at everything  I can slice and dice my history  perhaps by my search history    here  I was doing some nepotistic searching  looking for Bing  over here for Live Labs Pivot. And from these  I can drill into the web page and just launch them again. It's one metaphor repurposed multiple times  and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data. So right now  in this world  we think about data as being this curse. We talk about the curse of information overload. We talk about drowning in data. What if we can actually turn that upside down and turn the web upside down  so that instead of navigating from one thing to the next  we get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things  and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden  If we can do that  then instead of being trapped in data  we might actually extract information. And  instead of dealing just with information  we can tease out knowledge. And if we get the knowledge  then maybe even there's wisdom to be found. So with that  I thank you. I grew up on a steady diet of science fiction. In high school  I took a bus to school an hour each way every day. And I was always absorbed in a book  science fiction book  which took my mind to other worlds  and satisfied  in a narrative form  this insatiable sense of curiosity that I had. And you know  that curiosity also manifested itself in the fact that whenever I wasn't in school I was out in the woods  hiking and taking  samples     frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water    and bringing it back  looking at it under the microscope. You know  I was a real science geek. But it was all about trying to understand the world  understand the limits of possibility. And my love of science fiction actually seemed mirrored in the world around me  because what was happening  this was in the late '  s  we were going to the moon  we were exploring the deep oceans. Jacques Cousteau was coming into our living rooms with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places and a wondrous world that we could never really have previously imagined. So  that seemed to resonate with the whole science fiction part of it. And I was an artist. I could draw. I could paint. And I found that because there weren't video games and this saturation of CG movies and all of this imagery in the media landscape  I had to create these images in my head. You know  we all did  as kids having to read a book  and through the author's description  put something on the movie screen in our heads. And so  my response to this was to paint  to draw alien creatures  alien worlds  robots  spaceships  all that stuff. I was endlessly getting busted in math class doodling behind the textbook. That was    the creativity had to find its outlet somehow. And an interesting thing happened  The Jacques Cousteau shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on Earth. I might not really go to an alien world on a spaceship someday    that seemed pretty darn unlikely. But that was a world I could really go to  right here on Earth  that was as rich and exotic as anything that I had imagined from reading these books. So  I decided I was going to become a scuba diver at the age of   . And the only problem with that was that I lived in a little village in Canada      miles from the nearest ocean. But I didn't let that daunt me. I pestered my father until he finally found a scuba class in Buffalo  New York  right across the border from where we live. And I actually got certified in a pool at a YMCA in the dead of winter in Buffalo  New York. And I didn't see the ocean  a real ocean  for another two years  until we moved to California. Since then  in the intervening    years  I've spent about       hours underwater  and     hours of that was in submersibles. And I've learned that that deep ocean environment  and even the shallow oceans  are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagination. Nature's imagination is so boundless compared to our own meager human imagination. I still  to this day  stand in absolute awe of what I see when I make these dives. And my love affair with the ocean is ongoing  and just as strong as it ever was. But when I chose a career as an adult  it was filmmaking. And that seemed to be the best way to reconcile this urge I had to tell stories with my urges to create images. And I was  as a kid  constantly drawing comic books  and so on. So  filmmaking was the way to put pictures and stories together  and that made sense. And of course the stories that I chose to tell were science fiction stories   Terminator    Aliens  and  The Abyss.  And with  The Abyss   I was putting together my love of underwater and diving with filmmaking. So  you know  merging the two passions. Something interesting came out of  The Abyss   which was that to solve a specific narrative problem on that film  which was to create this kind of liquid water creature  we actually embraced computer generated animation  CG. And this resulted in the first soft surface character  CG animation that was ever in a movie. And even though the film didn't make any money    barely broke even  I should say    I witnessed something amazing  which is that the audience  the global audience  was mesmerized by this apparent magic. You know  it's Arthur Clarke's law that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. They were seeing something magical. And so that got me very excited. And I thought   Wow  this is something that needs to be embraced into the cinematic art.  So  with  Terminator     which was my next film  we took that much farther. Working with ILM  we created the liquid metal dude in that film. The success hung in the balance on whether that effect would work. And it did  and we created magic again  and we had the same result with an audience    although we did make a little more money on that one. So  drawing a line through those two dots of experience came to   This is going to be a whole new world   this was a whole new world of creativity for film artists. So  I started a company with Stan Winston  my good friend Stan Winston  who is the premier make up and creature designer at that time  and it was called Digital Domain. And the concept of the company was that we would leapfrog past the analog processes of optical printers and so on  and we would go right to digital production. And we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while. But we found ourselves lagging in the mid '  s in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually founded the company to do. So  I wrote this piece called  Avatar   which was meant to absolutely push the envelope of visual effects  of CG effects  beyond  with realistic human emotive characters generated in CG  and the main characters would all be in CG  and the world would be in CG. And the envelope pushed back  and I was told by the folks at my company that we weren't going to be able to do this for a while. So  I shelved it  and I made this other movie about a big ship that sinks. You know  I went and pitched it to the studio as  'Romeo and Juliet' on a ship   It's going to be this epic romance  passionate film.  Secretly  what I wanted to do was I wanted to dive to the real wreck of  Titanic.  And that's why I made the movie. And that's the truth. Now  the studio didn't know that. But I convinced them. I said   We're going to dive to the wreck. We're going to film it for real. We'll be using it in the opening of the film. It will be really important. It will be a great marketing hook.  And I talked them into funding an expedition. Sounds crazy. But this goes back to that theme about your imagination creating a reality. Because we actually created a reality where six months later  I find myself in a Russian submersible two and a half miles down in the north Atlantic  looking at the real Titanic through a view port. Not a movie  not HD    for real. Now  that blew my mind. And it took a lot of preparation  we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things. But  it struck me how much this dive  these deep dives  was like a space mission. You know  where it was highly technical  and it required enormous planning. You get in this capsule  you go down to this dark hostile environment where there is no hope of rescue if you can't get back by yourself. And I thought like   Wow. I'm like  living in a science fiction movie. This is really cool.  And so  I really got bitten by the bug of deep ocean exploration. Of course  the curiosity  the science component of it    it was everything. It was adventure  it was curiosity  it was imagination. And it was an experience that Hollywood couldn't give me. Because  you know  I could imagine a creature and we could create a visual effect for it. But I couldn't imagine what I was seeing out that window. As we did some of our subsequent expeditions  I was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents and sometimes things that I had never seen before  sometimes things that no one had seen before  that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and imaged them. So  I was completely smitten by this  and had to do more. And so  I actually made a kind of curious decision. After the success of  Titanic   I said   OK  I'm going to park my day job as a Hollywood movie maker  and I'm going to go be a full time explorer for a while.  And so  we started planning these expeditions. And we wound up going to the Bismark  and exploring it with robotic vehicles. We went back to the Titanic wreck. We took little bots that we had created that spooled a fiber optic. And the idea was to go in and do an interior survey of that ship  which had never been done. Nobody had ever looked inside the wreck. They didn't have the means to do it  so we created technology to do it. So  you know  here I am now  on the deck of Titanic  sitting in a submersible  and looking out at planks that look much like this  where I knew that the band had played. And I'm flying a little robotic vehicle through the corridor of the ship. When I say   I'm operating it   but my mind is in the vehicle. I felt like I was physically present inside the shipwreck of Titanic. And it was the most surreal kind of deja vu experience I've ever had  because I would know before I turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed it  because I had walked the set for months when we were making the movie. And the set was based as an exact replica on the blueprints of the ship. So  it was this absolutely remarkable experience. And it really made me realize that the telepresence experience    that you actually can have these robotic avatars  then your consciousness is injected into the vehicle  into this other form of existence. It was really  really quite profound. And it may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happening some decades out as we start to have cyborg bodies for exploration or for other means in many sort of post human futures that I can imagine  as a science fiction fan. So  having done these expeditions  and really beginning to appreciate what was down there  such as at the deep ocean vents where we had these amazing  amazing animals    they're basically aliens right here on Earth. They live in an environment of chemosynthesis. They don't survive on sunlight based system the way we do. And so  you're seeing animals that are living next to a     degree Centigrade water plumes. You think they can't possibly exist. At the same time I was getting very interested in space science as well    again  it's the science fiction influence  as a kid. And I wound up getting involved with the space community  really involved with NASA  sitting on the NASA advisory board  planning actual space missions  going to Russia  going through the pre cosmonaut biomedical protocols  and all these sorts of things  to actually go and fly to the international space station with our  D camera systems. And this was fascinating. But what I wound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep. And taking them down so that they had access    astrobiologists  planetary scientists  people who were interested in these extreme environments    taking them down to the vents  and letting them see  and take samples and test instruments  and so on. So  here we were making documentary films  but actually doing science  and actually doing space science. I'd completely closed the loop between being the science fiction fan  you know  as a kid  and doing this stuff for real. And you know  along the way in this journey of discovery  I learned a lot. I learned a lot about science. But I also learned a lot about leadership. Now you think director has got to be a leader  leader of  captain of the ship  and all that sort of thing. I didn't really learn about leadership until I did these expeditions. Because I had to  at a certain point  say   What am I doing out here  Why am I doing this  What do I get out of it   We don't make money at these damn shows. We barely break even. There is no fame in it. People sort of think I went away between  Titanic  and  Avatar  and was buffing my nails someplace  sitting at the beach. Made all these films  made all these documentary films for a very limited audience. No fame  no glory  no money. What are you doing  You're doing it for the task itself  for the challenge    and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is    for the thrill of discovery  and for that strange bond that happens when a small group of people form a tightly knit team. Because we would do these things with        people  working for years at a time  sometimes at sea for two  three months at a time. And in that bond  you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you  that you've done a task that you can't explain to someone else. When you come back to the shore and you say   We had to do this  and the fiber optic  and the attentuation  and the this and the that  all the technology of it  and the difficulty  the human performance aspects of working at sea   you can't explain it to people. It's that thing that maybe cops have  or people in combat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it. Creates a bond  creates a bond of respect. So  when I came back to make my next movie  which was  Avatar   I tried to apply that same principle of leadership  which is that you respect your team  and you earn their respect in return. And it really changed the dynamic. So  here I was again with a small team  in uncharted territory  doing  Avatar   coming up with new technology that didn't exist before. Tremendously exciting. Tremendously challenging. And we became a family  over a four and half year period. And it completely changed how I do movies. So  people have commented on how   Well  you know  you brought back the ocean organisms and put them on the planet of Pandora.  To me  it was more of a fundamental way of doing business  the process itself  that changed as a result of that. So  what can we synthesize out of all this  You know  what are the lessons learned  Well  I think number one is curiosity. It's the most powerful thing you own. Imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality. And the respect of your team is more important than all the laurels in the world. I have young filmmakers come up to me and say   Give me some advice for doing this.  And I say   Don't put limitations on yourself. Other people will do that for you    don't do it to yourself  don't bet against yourself  and take risks.  NASA has this phrase that they like   Failure is not an option.  But failure has to be an option in art and in exploration  because it's a leap of faith. And no important endeavor that required innovation was done without risk. You have to be willing to take those risks. So  that's the thought I would leave you with  is that in whatever you're doing  failure is an option  but fear is not. Thank you. I'm Jon M. Chu. And I'm not a dancer  I'm not a choreographer    I'm actually a filmmaker  a storyteller. I directed a movie two years ago called  Step Up    The Streets.  Anybody  Anybody  Yeah  During that movie I got to meet a ton of hip hop dancers    amazing  the best in the world    and they brought me into a society  the sort of underground street culture that blew my mind. I mean  this is literally human beings with super human strength and abilities. They could fly in the air. They could bend their elbow all the way back. They could spin on their heads for    times in a row. I'd never seen anything like that. When I was growing up  my heroes were people like Fred Astaire  Gene Kelly  Michael Jackson. I grew up in a musical family. And those guys  those were like  ultimate heroes. Being a shy  little  skinny Asian kid growing up in the Silicon Valley with low self esteem  those guys made me believe in something bigger. Those guys made me want to  like   I'm going to do that moonwalk at that bar mitzvah tonight for that girl.  And it seems like those dance heroes have disappeared  sort of relegated to the background of pop stars and music videos. But after seeing what I've seen  the truth is  they have not disappeared at all. They're here  getting better and better every day. And dance has progressed. It is insane what dance is right now. Dance has never had a better friend than technology. Online videos and social networking ... dancers have created a whole global laboratory online for dance  where kids in Japan are taking moves from a YouTube video created in Detroit  building on it within days and releasing a new video  while teenagers in California are taking the Japanese video and remixing it with a Philly flair to create a whole new dance style in itself. And this is happening every day. And from these bedrooms and living rooms and garages  with cheap webcams  lies the world's great dancers of tomorrow. Our Fred Astaires  our Gene Kellys our Michael Jacksons are right at our fingertips  and may not have that opportunity  except for us. So  we created the LXD  sort of a    the Legion of Extraordinary Dancers  a justice league of dancers that believe that dance can have a transformative effect on the world. A living  breathing comic book series  but unlike Spiderman and Iron Man  these guys can actually do it. And we're going to show you some today. So  let me introduce to you  some of our heroes right now. We got Madd Chadd  Lil' C  Kid David and J Smooth. Please be excited  have fun  yell  scream. Ladies and gentlemen  The LXD. I get a lot of different reactions actually. Sometimes you would think that maybe kids would enjoy it  but sometimes they get a little freaked out. And  I don't know  I kind of get a kick out of that a little bit. J Smooth  When I'm in the zone    I'm dancing and free styling it    I actually visually kind of picture lines  and moving them. I think of like  Transformers  like how panels open and then they fold  they fold in  and then you close that panel. And then another thing opens  you close that. Kid David  It's kind of like  honestly a lot of times I don't really know what's going on when I'm dancing. Because at that point it's just really like  it's my body and the music. It's not really a conscious decision   I'm going to do this next  I'm going to do this.  It's kind of like this other level where you can't make choices anymore  and it's just your body reacting to certain sounds in the music. I got my name just because I was so young. I was young when I started. I was younger than a lot of the people I was dancing with. So  it was always like  they called me Kid David  because I was the kid. L'il C  I tell them to create a ball  and then you just use that ball of energy. And instead of throwing it out  people would think that's a krump move  that's a krump move. That's not a krump move. You're going to throw it out  you throw it out  and you hold it. And you let it go  and then right when you see the tail  you grab it by the tail  then you bring it back in. And you just got this piece of energy and you just  you're manipulating it. You know  you create power  then you tame it. I have a vision for each one of you  and the vision I have for you is that when you wake up in the morning  your blood is singing at the thought of being who you are and doing what you do  that as you go through the day  you can literally sink to your knees in gratitude at the tremendous good fortune that's been bestowed on you  that as you go through the day  you become radiantly alive several times. And if your life isn't like that  I'd like to humbly suggest that you're wasting your life. A life is too short to be wasted. So what I propose to do in the next    minutes    I've used up one minute already    is to give you a set of powerful tools which can get you started on being there. Is that of interest to you  Audience  Yes. Srikumar Rao  OK. This is a conference on happiness  but even if it wasn't a conference on happiness  would it be right if I said that in some way  shape  fashion or form  you're devoting your entire life to being happy  Everything you do    your job  family  children  relationships  whatever    is a quest for happiness. Correct  I'd like you to think about the following  What do you have to get in order to be happy  We're just going to spend a minute on this. What do you have to get in order to be happy  Anybody  quick  When I conduct this experiment  a bunch of stuff comes up  vast wealth  trophy spouse  good health  lots of travel  time  etc  etc  etc. Right now  if you were to think about it  you probably have a list of   Here's what I need to get in order to be happy.  I would like you to consider this  anything that you can get    let me repeat that    anything you can get  you can un get. Is that correct  So  vast wealth can make you happy. Vast wealth can disappear tomorrow. A number of people in the financial sector have discovered this already. So whatever you get that can make you happy can go away. Where does that leave you  Not a very nice place  right  I have a different proposition to suggest to you. What I have to suggest to you is that there is nothing that you have to get  do or be in order to be happy. Let me repeat that  there is nothing that you have to get  do or be in order to be happy. In fact  happiness is your innate nature. It is hardwired into you. It is part of your DNA. You cannot not be happy. Now  all of you are very polite  and in some of the other forums I speak in  such as top business schools  they're not so polite. And invariably  somebody articulates what many of you are thinking  which is   If happiness is my innate nature  how come I am not experiencing it  How come I am experiencing my life sucks   And the answer to that is actually very simple. You have spent your entire life learning to be unhappy. Let me repeat that  you have spent your entire life learning to be unhappy. And the way we learn to be unhappy is by buying into a particular mental model. A mental model is a notion we have that this is the way the world works. All of us have mental models  we've got dozens of mental models. We've got mental models on how to find a job  how to get ahead at work  how to pick a restaurant to eat at  how to have a movie to go to ... dozens of them. The problem isn't that we have mental models. The problem is that we don't know that we have mental models. We think this is the way the world works. And the more we invest in a mental model  the more it appears that this  in fact  is the way the world works. But it isn't  it's just a mental model  and the mental model we have that we buy into so strongly is that we have to get something so we can do something so we can be something. Like  we have to get a great deal of money so we can travel to exotic places so we can be happy. We have to be in a relationship so we can have great sex so we can be happy. All of this is a variation of the if then model. And the if then model is  if this happens  then we will be happy. If I were to get a better job  if I were to get more money  if my boss would have a heart attack  if only I was married  if only my wife would leave me    if only I had children  if my children would grow up and go to college ... It doesn't matter what it is. The whole notion is if this happens  then I will be happy. And right now  the only thing that's different between the persons in this audience is what is the particular  if  that you are focusing on  And the only thing that's different between you now and where you were    years ago is what is the particular  if  that you were focusing on  Think about your life    years ago. Spend a minute doing that. Ten years ago  if you remember clearly  there were certain things you wanted. Is that correct  Odds are pretty good that many of those things you wanted    years ago you now have. Is that correct  Where has that left you  In exactly the same place  right  What we don't realize is the model itself is flawed. The if then model     If this happens I will be happy     the model itself is flawed. But instead of recognizing that it is the model itself that's flawed  what we do is spend enormous amounts of time changing the  if.   Oh  well  I thought if I became CEO it would help  but now I realize it's not that I want to become a CEO. I want to become the billionaire CEO  and then I will be happy.  You've got your own variation on that. But it's the model itself that's flawed  not what you put on the  if  side of the equation. I can demonstrate that to you. Can any of you recall a time when you were confronted with a scene of such spectacular beauty that it took you outside of yourself into a place of great serenity  Maybe a rainbow  a mountain range  a valley  the sea. And if you remember that    raise your hands if you could. Virtually all of you could  right  Have you ever wondered why that happened  The reason that happened is that somehow  for some reason  at that instant  you accepted the universe exactly as it was. You didn't say   That's a beautiful rainbow  but it's kind of off to the left  and if I could move it     yards to the right  it would be ever so much more beautiful.  You didn't say   That's a beautiful valley  but the tree in the foreground has too many crooked branches. So if you gave me a chainsaw and    minutes  I'd make it ever so much better.  Oh no  the rainbow off center was just fine. The tree with its crooked branches was just fine. And the moment you accepted the universe just as it was  your habitual wanting self dropped away  and the happiness which is your innate nature surfaced  and you felt it. And I know you felt it because now  even now after all those years  you can still remember it. The problem is that your life right now  with all of the problems that you have    more precisely  all of the problems that you think you have    is equally perfect. But you do not accept it. In fact  you're spending all your time striving with might and main to make it different. You are not accepting it. And when you're not accepting it  you're buying into the if then model  if this happens  then I will be happy. And it's the model itself that is flawed. So let me show you how you can get out of that  or at least you can begin the steps towards getting out of that. I'd like to share with you that action. We all live our lives because we want to achieve something  correct  You know  we are here and we want to have something. Alex wants to have a successful conference. You know  many of you want to have great programs for your companies that are very successful. You want to progress  have more money  all of that  is that correct  Each of those is an outcome  you would like something to happen. Now  I'd like you to think about the following  actions are within your control  not entirely  but to a large extent. The outcome is completely out of your control. OK  Actions are within your control. The outcome is completely outside your control. Have any of you recognized that when you have a goal and you start to work towards it  some of the time you don't achieve your goal  and some of the time what you get is the exact opposite of what you wanted  Has that happened to any of you  Like there was a friend of mine who said   Gee  you know  I have not been paying a lot of attention to my wife  and this has to change.  So the next time we went on a business trip  he bought a very expensive dress for her. And this was his way of showing  you know  I care for you  and nice things would happen. And when he presented the gift to his wife  her immediate reaction was   After    years of marriage  you don't know my size    And furthermore  don't you know I never wear this kind of thing   And the next thing you know  he had a full blown marital spat. Has that happened to any of you  You've taken action for a particular outcome and the outcome you got was the exact opposite of what you wanted  Happens all the time. Well  we live in a world where what we think of  what we invest in  is the outcome. We define our life in the following way  here I am  here is where I want to go  these are the steps I have to take in order to get from where I am to where I want to go  and if I succeed  life is wonderful. And if I don't  then I have failed  life is no good  life sucks. True  False  That is how we live. We invest in the outcome  and as I've just pointed out  the outcome is frequently different from what we would like  and sometimes the diametric opposite of what we would like. You invest in the outcome and you are guaranteed to have more than your share of frustration  angst and all the rest of the stuff that makes life suck. There is an alternative. And the alternative is that you do not invest in the outcome  you invest in the process. And the best way to describe that is a quote by John Wooden. I don't know how many of you are familiar with John Wooden. He's very well known in the United States and certainly among basketball fans. He's the only person ever to make the basketball Hall of Fame both as a player and as a coach. And what he told his entering team    he led UCLA to an unprecedented number of victories and finals in the NCAA    and what he used to tell any new team is he never spoke about winning. He always said   When it's over and you look in the mirror  did you do the best that you were capable of  And if you did the best that you were capable of  the score doesn't matter. But I would suspect that if you did the best that you were capable of  you will find the score to your liking.  That is investing in a process. What we do is the exact opposite. We invest in the outcome. This is what I want    oh  I want it so desperately  because if I get it I will be happy. And you try with might and main  to do whatever you can  but you are always focusing on   This is the outcome.  Now  focusing on the outcome is fine. It gives you direction. Investing in the outcome means that you make the achievement of a particular outcome dependent for your well being. And that is a surefire recipe for failure. What you can do is something else. You can invest in the process. That is  once you have determined  here is where I am  here is where I want to be  and that's fine  you focus on the outcome only to the extent that it gives you direction  and then you invest yourself completely in the process. You say  here are the steps you want to take  and you put everything into it. And if you succeed  wonderful. And if you don't succeed  still wonderful  because now you have a new starting point  and from that new starting point  you select another outcome and keep going. And when you do that  you will find that every day is a blast. Let me give you an example. And if you have children    raise your hands if you have children. Have you ever seen a small child learn to walk  What happens  and this happens typically between    and    months  is the child gets up and she sees everybody walking  she wants to walk  she gets up  she falls down  she starts crying and momma runs up and comforts her  kisses the place  makes it well. She tries again  falls down  mommy runs up again. After some time  mommy feels tired and no longer runs up and the child stops crying  and then she gets up  takes a step and doesn't fall down  and then she takes another  and a beautiful smile comes on her face. And very soon  generally within    hours  she's walking all over the place  upsetting your living room arrangements. And you know you've gone to a new stage of parenting. Right  Now  imagine what would happen if each time the child fell  she would say   Oh my God  I failed again. I'm never going to learn to walk.  And you have to get counseling for her to help her deal with feelings of inadequacy and not being able to achieve and fail yet again. How long do you think it would take her to learn to walk if you had to do that  if every three times she fell down  you had to get a counselor to counsel her and so on  Sounds funny  doesn't it  But that is exactly what we're doing. What the child is doing is focusing on the process. She's investing in the process  not in the outcome. What we do is the exact opposite. As we grow up  we lose the ability to invest in the process  we start investing in the outcome. By definition the outcome is outside of our control  and if that's where we spend all of our emotional energy  we are going to get drained as we do. But if  on the other hand  we said   Here is the outcome  I am going to invest in the process and give it every single bit I could   every day is a blast  and you're well on your way to achieving the vision that I outlined to you. The question that I get all the time  is people say   Professor Rao  but nothing makes me passionate.  So I say   OK  what would   And they invariably come up with  you know  here is a list of things. Here's my job and here's how much it pays  this is the kind of person my boss is  the kind of people my colleagues are  and here's how my customers are  here's how much I travel  here's how big my office is  how deep the carpeting is  how many windows I have    a bunch of parameters. And what I tell them is what I want to share with you  because all of that stuff    first of all  it doesn't exist. But second  even if it did and you were plugged into it  it would not take more than six months for you to be the same sorry  miserable self there as you are now  because passion exists inside you. It does not exist in the job. And if you don't find a way to ignite it within you right where you are  you are not going to find it outside. But if you do find a way to ignite it where you are  then you will find that the external world rearranges itself to accommodate the new person that you are becoming. And as you do that  you will find that miracles happen on a regular basis. Persons come up whom you're delighted to meet. New people enter your life. It's just a breeze  because all you do in your life is you take journeys. You came here to this conference  you went on a journey. You hang around the water cooler  talking about how terrible your place of work is  you went on a journey. You watch  Desperate Housewives   you go on a journey. You go on a journey where    something women are having affairs with    something gardeners while the husbands are playing around with models. All you do is go on journeys. There's nothing wrong with that  but just ask yourself   Is this a journey I want to take  Does this take me to a place I want to spend time   And if you start doing that  you will find that your life changes. The kind of people you meet  the things you talk about  the movies you go to  the books you read    everything changes. And you begin all of that by focusing on the process. Invest in the process  not in the outcome. Thank you. Last year here at TED I asked you to give me your data  to put your data on the web  on the basis that if people put data onto the web    government data  scientific data  community data  whatever it is    it will be used by other people to do wonderful things  in ways that they never could have imagined. So  today I'm back just to show you a few things  to show you  in fact  there is an open data movement afoot  now  around the world. The cry of  Raw data now   which I made people make in the auditorium  was heard around the world. So  let's roll the video. A classic story  the first one which lots of people picked up  was when in March    on March   th in fact  soon after TED    Paul Clarke  in the U.K. government  blogged   Oh  I've just got some raw data. Here it is  it's about bicycle accidents.  Two days it took the Times Online to make a map  a mashable map    we call these things mash ups    a mashed up user interface that allows you to go in there and have a look and find out whether your bicycle route to work was affected. Here's more data  traffic survey data  again  put out by the U.K. government  and because they put it up using the Linked Data standards  then a user could just make a map  just by clicking. Does this data affect things  Well  let's get back to     . Look at Zanesville  Ohio. Here's a map a lawyer made. He put on it the water plant  and which houses are there  which houses have been connected to the water. And he got  from other data sources  information to show which houses are occupied by white people. Well  there was too much of a correlation  he felt  between which houses were occupied by white people and which houses had water  and the judge was not impressed either. The judge was not impressed to the tune of   .  million dollars. That's the power of taking one piece of data  another piece of data  putting it together  and showing the result. Let's look at some data from the U.K. now. This is U.K. government data  a completely independent site  Where Does My Money Go. It allows anybody to go there and burrow down. You can burrow down by a particular type of spending  or you can go through all the different regions and compare them. So  that's happening in the U.K. with U.K. government data. Yes  certainly you can do it over here. Here's a site which allows you to look at recovery spending in California. Take an arbitrary example  Long Beach  California  you can go and have a look at what recovery money they've been spending on different things such as energy. In fact  this is the graph of the number of data sets in the repositories of data.gov  and data.gov.uk. And I'm delighted to see a great competition between the U.K. in blue  and the U.S. in red. How can you use this stuff  Well  for example  if you have lots of data about places you can take  from a postcode    which is like a zip plus four    for a specific group of houses  you can make paper  print off a paper which has got very  very specific things about the bus stops  the things specifically near you. On a larger scale  this is a mash up of the data which was released about the Afghan elections. It allows you to set your own criteria for what sort of things you want to look at. The red circles are polling stations  selected by your criteria. And then you can select also other things on the map to see what other factors  like the threat level. So  that was government data. I also talked about community generated data    in fact I edited some. This is the wiki map  this is the Open Street Map.  Terrace Theater  I actually put on the map because it wasn't on the map before TED last year. I was not the only person editing the open street map. Each flash on this visualization    put together by ITO World    shows an edit in      made to the Open Street Map. Let's now spin the world during the same year. Every flash is an edit. Somebody somewhere looking at the Open Street Map  and realizing it could be better. You can see Europe is ablaze with updates. Some places  perhaps not as much as they should be. Here focusing in on Haiti. The map of Port au Prince at the end of      was not all it could be  not as good as the map of California. Fortunately  just after the earthquake  GeoEye  a commercial company  released satellite imagery with a license  which allowed the open source community to use it. This is January  in time lapse  of people editing ... that's the earthquake. After the earthquake  immediately  people all over the world  mappers who wanted to help  and could  looked at that imagery  built the map  quickly building it up. We're focusing now on Port au Prince. The light blue is refugee camps these volunteers had spotted from the  satellite images . So  now we have  immediately  a real time map showing where there are refugee camps    rapidly became the best map to use if you're doing relief work in Port au Prince. Witness the fact that it's here on this Garmin device being used by rescue team in Haiti. There's the map showing  on the left hand side  that hospital    actually that's a hospital ship. This is a real time map that shows blocked roads  damaged buildings  refugee camps    it shows things that are needed  for rescue and relief work . So  if you've been involved in that at all  I just wanted to say  Whatever you've been doing  whether you've just been chanting   Raw data now   or you've been putting government or scientific data online  I just wanted to take this opportunity to say  Thank you very much  and we have only just started  I only have three minutes so I'm going to have to talk fast  and it will use up your spare mental cycles  so multitasking may be hard. So     years ago I got a traffic ticket that got me thinking. I've had some time to think it over. And energy efficiency is more than just about the vehicle    it's also about the road. Road design makes a difference  particularly intersections  of which there are two types  signalized and unsignalized  which means stop signs. Fifty percent of crashes happen at intersections. Roundabouts are much better. A study of    intersections has found crashes drop    percent from when you convert a traffic light into a roundabout. Injury crashes have dropped    percent  fatal crashes down    percent. But that's just safety. What about time and gas  So  traffic keeps flowing  so that means less braking  which means less accelerating  less gas and less pollution  less time wasted  and that partly accounts for Europe's better efficiency than we have in the United States. So  unsignalized intersections  meaning stop signs  they save many lives  but there's an excessive proliferation of them. Small roundabouts are starting to appear. This is one in my neighborhood. And they are much better    better than traffic lights  better than four way stop signs. They're expensive to install  but they are more expensive not to. So  we should look at that. But they are not applicable in all situations. So  take  for example  the three way intersection. So  it's logical that you'd have one there  on the minor road entering the major. But the other two are somewhat questionable. So  here's one. There's another one which I studied. Cars rarely appear on that third road. And so  the question is  what does that cost us  That intersection I looked at had about       cars per day in each direction  and so that's two ounces of gas to accelerate out of. That's five cents each  and times       cars per day  that's         per year. That's just the gasoline cost. There is also pollution  wear on the car  and time. What's that time worth  Well  at    seconds per       cars  that's  .  hours per day. The average wage in the U.S. is     an hour. That is        per year. Add that together with the gas  and it's          per year  just for that sign in each direction. Discount that back to the present  at five percent  over two million dollars for a stop sign  in each direction. Now  if you look at what that adjacent property is worth  you could actually buy the property  cut down the shrubbery to improve the sight line  and then sell it off again. And you'd still come out ahead. So  it makes one wonder   Why is it there   I mean  why is there that stop sign in each direction  Because it is saving lives. So  is there a better way to accomplish that goal  The answer is to enable cars to come in from that side road safely. Because there are a lot of people who might live up there and if they're waiting forever a long queue could form because the cars aren't slowing down on the main road. Can that be accomplished with existing signs  So  there is a long history of stop signs and yield signs. Stop signs were invented in       yield signs in     . But that's all we got. So  why not use a yield sign  Well the meaning of yield is  You must yield the right of way. That means that if there are five cars waiting  you have to wait till they all go  then you go. It lacks the notion of alternating  or taking turns  and it's always on the minor road  allowing the major one to have primacy. So  it's hard to create a new meaning for the existing sign. You couldn't suddenly tell everyone   OK  remember what you used to do at yield signs  Now do something different.  That would not work. So  what the world needs now is a new type of sign. So  you'd have a little instruction below it  you know  for those who didn't see the public service announcements. And it merges the stop sign and yield signs. It's kind of shaped like a T  as in taking turns. And uncertainty results in caution. When people come to an unfamiliar situation they don't know how to deal with they slow down. So  now that you are all  Road Scholars  ... don't wait for that sign to be adopted  these things don't change quickly. But you all are members of communities  and you can exercise your community influence to create more sensible traffic flows. And you can have more impact on the environment just getting your neighborhood to change these things than by changing your vehicle. Thank you very much. So  I've known a lot of fish in my life. I've loved only two. That first one  it was more like a passionate affair. It was a beautiful fish  flavorful  textured  meaty  a bestseller on the menu. What a fish. Even better  it was farm raised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability. So you could feel good about selling it. I was in a relationship with this beauty for several months. One day  the head of the company called and asked if I'd speak at an event about the farm's sustainability.  Absolutely   I said. Here was a company trying to solve what's become this unimaginable problem for us chefs  How do we keep fish on our menus  For the past    years  we've been fishing the seas like we clear cut forests. It's hard to overstate the destruction. Ninety percent of large fish  the ones we love    the tunas  the halibuts  the salmons  swordfish    they've collapsed. There's almost nothing left. So  for better or for worse  aquaculture  fish farming  is going to be a part of our future. A lot of arguments against it  Fish farms pollute    most of them do anyway    and they're inefficient. Take tuna  a major drawback. It's got a feed conversion ratio of    to one. That means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna. Not very sustainable. It doesn't taste very good either. So here  finally  was a company trying to do it right. I wanted to support them. The day before the event  I called the head of P.R. for the company. Let's call him Don.  Don   I said   just to get the facts straight  you guys are famous for farming so far out to sea  you don't pollute.   That's right   he said.  We're so far out  the waste from our fish gets distributed  not concentrated.  And then he added   We're basically a world unto ourselves. That feed conversion ratio   .  to one   he said.  Best in the business.   .  to one  great.   .  what  What are you feeding    Sustainable proteins   he said.  Great   I said. Got off the phone. And that night  I was lying in bed  and I thought  What the hell is a sustainable protein  So the next day  just before the event  I called Don. I said   Don  what are some examples of sustainable proteins   He said he didn't know. He would ask around. Well  I got on the phone with a few people in the company  no one could give me a straight answer until finally  I got on the phone with the head biologist. Let's call him Don too.  Don   I said   what are some examples of sustainable proteins   Well  he mentioned some algaes and some fish meals  and then he said chicken pellets. I said   Chicken pellets   He said   Yeah  feathers  skin  bone meal  scraps  dried and processed into feed.  I said   What percentage of your feed is chicken   Thinking  you know  two percent.  Well  it's about    percent   he said. I said   Don  what's sustainable about feeding chicken to fish   There was a long pause on the line  and he said   There's just too much chicken in the world.  I fell out of love with this fish. No  not because I'm some self righteous  goody two shoes foodie. I actually am. No  I actually fell out of love with this fish because  I swear to God  after that conversation  the fish tasted like chicken. This second fish  it's a different kind of love story. It's the romantic kind  the kind where the more you get to know your fish  you love the fish. I first ate it at a restaurant in southern Spain. A journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time. She kind of set us up. It came to the table a bright  almost shimmering  white color. The chef had overcooked it. Like twice over. Amazingly  it was still delicious. Who can make a fish taste good after it's been overcooked  I can't  but this guy can. Let's call him Miguel    actually his name is Miguel. And no  he didn't cook the fish  and he's not a chef  at least in the way that you and I understand it. He's a biologist at Veta La Palma. It's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain. It's at the tip of the Guadalquivir river. Until the     s  the farm was in the hands of the Argentinians. They raised beef cattle on what was essentially wetlands. They did it by draining the land. They built this intricate series of canals  and they pushed water off the land and out into the river. Well  they couldn't make it work  not economically. And ecologically  it was a disaster. It killed like    percent of the birds  which  for this place  is a lot of birds. And so in       a Spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land. What did they do  They reversed the flow of water. They literally flipped the switch. Instead of pushing water out  they used the channels to pull water back in. They flooded the canals. They created a        acre fish farm    bass  mullet  shrimp  eel    and in the process  Miguel and this company completely reversed the ecological destruction. The farm's incredible. I mean  you've never seen anything like this. You stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away  and all you see are flooded canals and this thick  rich marshland. I was there not long ago with Miguel. He's an amazing guy  like three parts Charles Darwin and one part Crocodile Dundee. Okay  There we are slogging through the wetlands  and I'm panting and sweating  got mud up to my knees  and Miguel's calmly conducting a biology lecture. Here  he's pointing out a rare Black shouldered Kite. Now  he's mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton. And here  here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the Tanzanian Giraffe. It turns out  Miguel spent the better part of his career in the Mikumi National Park in Africa. I asked him how he became such an expert on fish. He said   Fish  I didn't know anything about fish. I'm an expert in relationships.  And then he's off  launching into more talk about rare birds and algaes and strange aquatic plants. And don't get me wrong  that was really fascinating  you know  the biotic community unplugged  kind of thing. It's great  but I was in love. And my head was swooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish I had the night before. So I interrupted him. I said   Miguel  what makes your fish taste so good   He pointed at the algae.  I know  dude  the algae  the phytoplankton  the relationships  It's amazing. But what are your fish eating  What's the feed conversion ratio   Well  he goes on to tell me it's such a rich system that the fish are eating what they'd be eating in the wild. The plant biomass  the phytoplankton  the zooplankton  it's what feeds the fish. The system is so healthy  it's totally self renewing. There is no feed. Ever heard of a farm that doesn't feed its animals  Later that day  I was driving around this property with Miguel  and I asked him  I said   For a place that seems so natural  unlike like any farm I'd ever been at  how do you measure success   At that moment  it was as if a film director called for a set change. And we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight  thousands and thousands of pink flamingos  a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see.  That's success   he said.  Look at their bellies  pink. They're feasting.  Feasting  I was totally confused. I said   Miguel  aren't they feasting on your fish    Yes   he said.  We lose    percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds. Well  last year  this property had         birds on it  more than     different species. It's become  today  the largest and one of the most important private bird sanctuaries in all of Europe.  I said   Miguel  isn't a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm   He shook his head  no. He said   We farm extensively  not intensively. This is an ecological network. The flamingos eat the shrimp. The shrimp eat the phytoplankton. So the pinker the belly  the better the system.  Okay  so let's review  a farm that doesn't feed its animals  and a farm that measures its success on the health of its predators. A fish farm  but also a bird sanctuary. Oh  and by the way  those flamingos  they shouldn't even be there in the first place. They brood in a town     miles away  where the soil conditions are better for building nests. Every morning  they fly     miles into the farm. And every evening  they fly     miles back. They do that because they're able to follow the broken white line of highway A  . No kidding. I was imagining a  March of the Penguins  thing  so I looked at Miguel. I said   Miguel  do they fly     miles to the farm  and then do they fly     miles back at night  Do they do that for the children   He looked at me like I had just quoted a Whitney Houston song. He said   No  they do it because the food's better.  I didn't mention the skin of my beloved fish  which was delicious    and I don't like fish skin  I don't like it seared  I don't like it crispy. It's that acrid  tar like flavor. I almost never cook with it. Yet  when I tasted it at that restaurant in southern Spain  it tasted not at all like fish skin. It tasted sweet and clean  like you were taking a bite of the ocean. I mentioned that to Miguel  and he nodded. He said   The skin acts like a sponge. It's the last defense before anything enters the body. It evolved to soak up impurities.  And then he added   But our water has no impurities.  OK. A farm that doesn't feed its fish  a farm that measures its success by the success of its predators. And then I realized when he says   A farm that has no impurities   he made a big understatement  because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the Guadalquivir River. It's a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days  chemical contaminants  pesticide runoff. And when it works its way through the system and leaves  the water is cleaner than when it entered. The system is so healthy  it purifies the water. So  not just a farm that doesn't feed its animals  not just a farm that measures its success by the health of its predators  but a farm that's literally a water purification plant    and not just for those fish  but for you and me as well. Because when that water leaves  it dumps out into the Atlantic. A drop in the ocean  I know  but I'll take it  and so should you  because this love story  however romantic  is also instructive. You might say it's a recipe for the future of good food  whether we're talking about bass or beef cattle. What we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture  one in which the food actually tastes good. But for a lot people  that's a bit too radical. We're not realists  us foodies  we're lovers. We love farmers' markets  we love small family farms  we talk about local food  we eat organic. And when you suggest these are the things that will ensure the future of good food  someone  somewhere stands up and says   Hey guy  I love pink flamingos  but how are you going to feed the world   How are you going to feed the world  Can I be honest  I don't love that question. No  not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world. One billion people will go hungry today. One billion    that's more than ever before    because of gross inequalities in distribution  not tonnage. Now  I don't love this question because it's determined the logic of our food system for the last    years. Feed grain to herbivores  pesticides to monocultures  chemicals to soil  chicken to fish  and all along agribusiness has simply asked   If we're feeding more people more cheaply  how terrible could that be   That's been the motivation  it's been the justification  it's been the business plan of American agriculture. We should call it what it is  a business in liquidation  a business that's quickly eroding ecological capital that makes that very production possible. That's not a business  and it isn't agriculture. Our breadbasket is threatened today  not because of diminishing supply  but because of diminishing resources. Not by the latest combine and tractor invention  but by fertile land  not by pumps  but by fresh water  not by chainsaws  but by forests  and not by fishing boats and nets  but by fish in the sea. Want to feed the world  Let's start by asking  How are we going to feed ourselves  Or better  How can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself  To do that  don't look at the agribusiness model for the future. It's really old  and it's tired. It's high on capital  chemistry and machines  and it's never produced anything really good to eat. Instead  let's look to the ecological model. That's the one that relies on two billion years of on the job experience. Look to Miguel  farmers like Miguel. Farms that aren't worlds unto themselves  farms that restore instead of deplete  farms that farm extensively instead of just intensively  farmers that are not just producers  but experts in relationships. Because they're the ones that are experts in flavor  too. And if I'm going to be really honest  they're a better chef than I'll ever be. You know  I'm okay with that  because if that's the future of good food  it's going to be delicious. Thank you. For some time I have been interested in the placebo effect  which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in  unless you think of it in the terms that I do  which is   Something fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real.  In other words  sugar pills have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies  the placebo effect  just because the person thinks that what's happening to them is a pharmaceutical or some sort of a    for pain management  for example  if they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect. Something fake becomes something real because of someone's perception of it. In order for us to understand each other  I want to start by showing you a rudimentary  very simple magic trick. And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a trick that's been in every children's magic book since at least the     s. I learned it myself from Cub Scout Magic in the     s. I'll do it for you  and then I'll explain it. And then I'll explain why I explained it. So  here's what happens. The knife  which you can examine  my hand  which you could examine. I'm just going to hold the knife in my fist like this. I'll get my sleeve back. And to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve I'm just going to squeeze my wrist right here. That way you can see that at no time can anything travel  as long as I'm squeezing there nothing can go up or down my sleeve. And the object of this is quite simple. I'm going to open my hand  and hopefully  if all is well  my pure animal magnetism will hold the knife. In fact it's held so tightly in place that I can shake it  and the knife does not come off. Nothing goes up or down my sleeve  no trickery. And you can examine everything. Ta da  So  this is a trick that I often teach to young children that are interested in magic  because you can learn a great deal about deception by studying this very    even though it's a very simple trick methodologically. Probably many of you in the room know this trick. What happens is this. I hold the knife in my hand. I say I'm going to grab hold of my wrist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve  that is a lie. The reason I'm holding onto my wrist is because that's actually the secret of the illusion. In a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you  this finger right here  my index finger is just going to shift from where it is  to a position pointing out like this. Nice one. Someone who didn't have a childhood is out there. So  it goes like this  from here  right. And as I move around my finger shifts. And we could talk about why this is deceptive  why you don't notice there are only three fingers down here  because the mind  and the way it processes information  it doesn't count  one  two  three. It groups them. But that's not really what this is about. Right  And then I open my hand up. Obviously it's clinging there  not by animal magnetism  but by chicanery  my index finger being there. And then when I close my finger  same thing  as I move back  this motion kind of covers the moving back of my finger. I take this hand away. You give the knife out. There is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors. Thanks. Now   Laughter  what does that have to do with the placebo effect  I read a study a year or so ago that really blew my mind wide open. I'm not a doctor or a researcher  so this  to me  was an astonishing thing. It turns out that if you administer a placebo in the form of a white pill  that's like aspirin shaped    it's just a round white pill    it has some certain measurable effect. But if you change the form that you give the placebo in  like you make a smaller pill  and color it blue  and stamp a letter into it  it is actually measurably more effective. Even though neither one of these things has any pharmaceutical    they're sugar pills. But a white pill is not as good as a blue pill. What   Laughter  That really flipped me out. Turns out though  that that's not even where it stops. If you have capsules  they're more effective than tablets in any form. A colored capsule  that's yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white capsule. Dosage has something to do with this. One pill twice a day is not as good at three pills    I don't remember the statistic now. Sorry. But the point is ... And the form has something to do with it. And if you want the ultimate in placebo  you've go to the needle. Right  A syringe with some inert    a couple CCs of some inert something  and you inject this into a patient ... Well this is such a powerful image in their mind  it's so much stronger than the white pill. It's a really  this graph  well I'll show it to you some other time when we have slides. The point is the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle. And none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality  it's only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a stronger effect. I wanted to see if I could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick. And take something that is obviously a fake trick and make it seem real. And we know from that study that when you want reality  you go to the needle. This is a seven inch hatpin. It's very  very sharp  and I'm going to just sterilize it a tiny bit. This is really my flesh. This is not Damian's special grown flesh. That's my skin right there. This is not a Hollywood special effect. I'm going to pierce my skin and run this needle through to the other side. If you're queasy     Laughs  if you faint easily    I was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night  and some people that I didn't know  and one woman almost passed out. So  I suggest if you get queasy easy that you look away for about the next       in fact  you know what  I'll do the first bad part behind it. You'll get to see  you can look away too if you'd like to. So  here is what happens  right here  the beginning of my flesh at the lower part of my arm I just make a little pierce. I'm sorry  man. Am I freaking you out  OK  and then just through my skin a tiny bit  and then out the other side like this. Now  essentially we're in the same position we were in with the knife trick. Sort of. But you can't count my fingers right now can you  So  let me show them to you. That's one  two three  four  five. Yes  well... I know what people think when they see this. They go   Well  he's certainly not dumb enough to stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes. So  let me give you a little peek. How's that look out there  Pretty good. Yeah  I know.  Laughs  And the people in the back go   OK  I didn't really see that.  People in the satellite room are starting to move in now. Let me give you good close look at this. That really is my skin. That is not a Hollywood special effect. That's my flesh  and I can twist that around. I'm sorry. If you're getting queasy  look away  don't look at the thing. People in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go   Well yeah  that looks kind of neat in some sort of effect there  but if it were real he would be    see there's a hole there and a hole there  if it were real he would be bleeding. Well let me work up some blood for you. Yes  there it is. Normally now  I would take the needle out. I would clean off my arm  and I would show you that there are no wounds. But I think in this context and with the idea of taking something fake and making it into something real  I'm just going to leave it there  and walk off the stage. I will be seeing you several times over the next few days. I hope you're looking forward to that. Thank you very much. I'm going to talk to you today about my work on suspended animation. Now  usually when I mention suspended animation  people will flash me the Vulcan sign and laugh. But now  I'm not talking about gorking people out to fly to Mars or even Pandora  as much fun as that may be. I'm talking about the concept of using suspended animation to help people out in trauma. So what do I mean when I say  suspended animation   It is the process by which animals de animate  appear dead and then can wake up again without being harmed. OK  so here is the sort of big idea  If you look out at nature  you find that as you tend to see suspended animation  you tend to see immortality. And so  what I'm going to tell you about is a way to tell a person who's in trauma    find a way to de animate them a bit so they're a little more immortal when they have that heart attack. An example of an organism or two that happens to be quite immortal would be plant seeds or bacterial spores. These creatures are some of the most immortal life forms on our planet  and they tend to spend most of their time in suspended animation. Bacterial spores are thought now by scientists to exist as individual cells that are alive  but in suspended animation for as long as     million years. To suggest that this all  sort of  about little  tiny creatures  I want to bring it close to home. In the immortal germ line of human beings    that is  the eggs that sit in the ovaries    they actually sit there in a state of suspended animation for up to    years in the life of each woman. So then there's also my favorite example of suspended animation. This is Sea Monkeys. Those of you with children  you know about them. You go to the pet store or the toy store  and you can buy these things. You just open the bag  and you just dump them into the plastic aquarium  and in about a week or so  you'll have little shrimps swimming around. Well  I wasn't so interested in the swimming. I was interested in what was going on in the bag  the bag on the toy store shelf where those shrimp sat in suspended animation indefinitely. So these ideas of suspended animation are not just about cells and weird  little organisms. Occasionally  human beings are briefly de animated  and the stories of people who are briefly de animated that interest me the most are those having to do with the cold. Ten years ago  there was a skier in Norway that was trapped in an icy waterfall  and she was there for two hours before they extracted her. She was extremely cold  and she had no heartbeat    for all intents and purposes she was dead  frozen. Seven hours later  still without a heartbeat  they brought her back to life  and she went on to be the head radiologist in the hospital that treated her. A couple of years later    so I get really excited about these things    about a couple of years later  there was a    month old  she was from Canada. Her father had gone out in the wintertime  he was working night shift  and she followed him outside in nothing but a diaper. And they found her hours later  frozen  lifeless  and they brought her back to life. There was a    year old woman in Duluth  Minnesota last year that was found frozen and without a pulse in her front yard one morning in the winter  and they brought her back to life. The next day  she was doing so well  they wanted to run tests on her. She got cranky and just went home. So  these are miracles  right  These are truly miraculous things that happen. Doctors have a saying that  in fact   You're not dead until you're warm and dead.  And it's true. It's true. In the New England Journal of Medicine  there was a study published that showed that with appropriate rewarming  people who had suffered without a heartbeat for three hours could be brought back to life without any neurologic problems. That's over    percent. So what I was trying to do is think of a way that we could study suspended animation to think about a way to reproduce  maybe  what happened to the skier. Well  I have to tell you something very odd  and that is that being exposed to low oxygen does not always kill. So  in this room  there's    percent oxygen or so  and if we reduce the oxygen concentration  we will all be dead. And  in fact  the animals we were working with in the lab    these little garden worms  nematodes    they were also dead when we exposed them to low oxygen. And here's the thing that should freak you out. And that is that  when we lower the oxygen concentration further by     times  to    parts per million  they were not dead  they were in suspended animation  and we could bring them back to life without any harm. And this precise oxygen concentration     parts per million  that caused suspended animation  is conserved. We can see it in a variety of different organisms. One of the creatures we see it in is a fish. And we can turn its heartbeat on and off by going in and out of suspended animation like you would a light switch. So this was pretty shocking to me  that we could do this. And so I was wondering  when we were trying to reproduce the work with the skier  that we noticed that  of course  she had no oxygen consumption  and so maybe she was in a similar state of suspended animation. But  of course  she was also extremely cold. So we wondered what would happen if we took our suspended animals and exposed them to the cold. And so  what we found out was that  if you take animals that are animated like you and I  and you make them cold    that is  these were the garden worms    now they're dead. But if you have them in suspended animation  and move them into the cold  they're all alive. And there's the very important thing there  If you want to survive the cold  you ought to be suspended. Right  It's a really good thing. And so  we were thinking about that  about this relationship between these things  and thinking about whether or not that's what happened to the skier. And so we wondered  Might there be some agent that is in us  something that we make ourselves  that we might be able to regulate our own metabolic flexibility in such a way as to be able to survive when we got extremely cold  and might otherwise pass away  I thought it might be interesting to sort of hunt for such things. You know  I should mention briefly here that physiology textbooks that you can read about will tell you that this is a kind of heretical thing to suggest. We have  from the time we are slapped on the butt until we take our last dying breath    that's when we're newborn to when we're dead    we cannot reduce our metabolic rate below what's called a standard  or basal metabolic rate. But I knew that there were examples of creatures  also mammals  that do reduce their metabolic rate such as ground squirrels and bears  they reduce their metabolic rate in the wintertime when they hibernate. So I wondered  Might we be able to find some agent or trigger that might induce such a state in us  And so  we went looking for such things. And this was a period of time when we failed tremendously. Ken Robinson is here. He talked about the glories of failure. Well  we had a lot of them. We tried many different chemicals and agents  and we failed over and over again. So  one time  I was at home watching television on the couch while my wife was putting our child to bed  and I was watching a television show. It was a television show    it was a NOVA show on PBS    about caves in New Mexico. And this particular cave was Lechuguilla  and this cave is incredibly toxic to humans. The researchers had to suit up just to enter it. It's filled with this toxic gas  hydrogen sulfide. Now  hydrogen sulfide is curiously present in us. We make it ourselves. The highest concentration is in our brains. Yet  it was used as a chemical warfare agent in World War I. It's an extraordinarily toxic thing. In fact  in chemical accidents  hydrogen sulfide is known to    if you breathe too much of it  you collapse to the ground  you appear dead  but if you were brought out into room air  you can be reanimated without harm  if they do that quickly. So  I thought   Wow  I have to get some of this.  Now  it's post      America  and when you go into the research institute  and you say   Hi. I'd like to buy some concentrated  compressed gas cylinders of a lethal gas because I have these ideas  see  about wanting to suspend people. It's really going to be OK.  So that's kind of a tough day  but I said   There really is some basis for thinking why you might want to do this.  As I said  this agent is in us  and  in fact  here's a curious thing  it binds to the very place inside of your cells where oxygen binds  and where you burn it  and that you do this burning to live. And so we thought  like in a game of musical chairs  might we be able to give a person some hydrogen sulfide  and might it be able to occupy that place like in a game of musical chairs where oxygen might bind  And because you can't bind the oxygen  maybe you wouldn't consume it  and then maybe it would reduce your demand for oxygen. I mean  who knows  So     Laughter  So  there's the bit about the dopamine and being a little bit  what do you call it  delusional  and you might suggest that was it. And so  we wanted to find out might we be able to use hydrogen sulfide in the presence of cold  and we wanted to see whether we could reproduce this skier in a mammal. Now  mammals are warm blooded creatures  and when we get cold  we shake and we shiver  right  We try to keep our core temperature at    degrees by actually burning more oxygen. So  it was interesting for us when we applied hydrogen sulfide to a mouse when it was also cold because what happened is the core temperature of the mouse got cold. It stopped moving. It appeared dead. Its oxygen consumption rate fell by tenfold. And here's the really important point. I told you hydrogen sulfide is in us. It's rapidly metabolized  and all you have to do after six hours of being in this state of de animation is simply put the thing out in room air  and it warms up  and it's none the worse for wear. Now  this was cosmic. Really. Because we had found a way to de animate a mammal  and it didn't hurt it. Now  we'd found a way to reduce its oxygen consumption to rock bottom levels  and it was fine. Now  in this state of de animation  it could not go out dancing  but it was not dead  and it was not harmed. So we started to think  Is this the agent that might have been present in the skier  and might have she had more of it than someone else  and might that have been able to reduce her demand for oxygen before she got so cold that she otherwise would have died  as we found out with our worm experiments  So  we wondered  Can we do anything useful with this capacity to control metabolic flexibility  And one of the things we wondered    I'm sure some of you out there are economists  and you know all about supply and demand. And when supply is equal to demand  everything's fine  but when supply falls  in this case of oxygen  and demand stays high  you're dead. So  what I just told you is we can now reduce demand. We ought to be able to lower supply to unprecedented low levels without killing the animal. And with money we got from DARPA  we could show just that. If you give mice hydrogen sulfide  you can lower their demand for oxygen  and you can put them into oxygen concentrations that are as low as       feet above the top of Mt. Everest  and they can sit there for hours  and there's no problem. Well this was really cool. We also found out that we could subject animals to otherwise lethal blood loss  and we could save them if we gave them hydrogen sulfide. So these proof of concept experiments led me to say  I should found a company  and we should take this out to a wider playing field.  I founded a company called Ikaria with others' help. And this company  the first thing it did was make a liquid formulation of hydrogen sulfide an injectable form that we could put in and send it out to physician scientists all over the world who work on models of critical care medicine  and the results are incredibly positive. In one model of heart attack  animals given hydrogen sulfide showed a    percent reduction in heart damage compared to those who got the standard of care that you and I would receive if we were to have a heart attack here today. Same is true for organ failure  when you have loss of function owing to poor perfusion of kidney  of liver  acute respiratory distress syndrome and damage suffered in cardiac bypass surgery. So  these are the thought leaders in trauma medicine all over the world saying this is true  so it seems that exposure to hydrogen sulfide decreases damage that you receive from being exposed to otherwise lethal low oxygen. And I should say that the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide required to get this benefit are low  incredibly low. In fact  so low that physicians will not have to lower or dim the metabolism of people much at all to see the benefit I just mentioned  which is a wonderful thing  if you're thinking about adopting this. You don't want to be gorking people out just to save them  it's really confusing. So  I want to say that we're in human trials. Now  and so    Thank you. The Phase   safety studies are over  and we're doing fine  we're now moved on. We have to get to Phase   and Phase  . It's going to take us a few years. This has all moved very quickly  and the mouse experiments of hibernating mice happened in       the first human studies were done in       and we should know in a couple of years whether it works or not. And this all happened really quickly because of a lot of help from a lot of people. I want to mention that  first of all  my wife  without whom this talk and my work would not be possible  so thank you very much. Also  the brilliant scientists who work at my lab and also others on staff  the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle  Washington    wonderful place to work. And also the wonderful scientists and businesspeople at Ikaria. One thing those people did out there was take this technology of hydrogen sulfide  which is this start up company that's burning venture capital very quickly  and they fused it with another company that sells another toxic gas that's more toxic than hydrogen sulfide  and they give it to newborn babies who would otherwise die from a failure to be able to oxygenate their tissues properly. And this gas that is delivered in over a thousand critical care hospitals worldwide  now is approved  on label  and saves thousands of babies a year from certain death. So it's really incredible for me to be a part of this. And I want to say that I think we're on the path of understanding metabolic flexibility in a fundamental way  and that in the not too distant future  an EMT might give an injection of hydrogen sulfide  or some related compound  to a person suffering severe injuries  and that person might de animate a bit  they might become a little more immortal. Their metabolism will fall as though you were dimming a switch on a lamp at home. And then  they will have the time  that will buy them the time  to be transported to the hospital to get the care they need. And then  after they get that care    like the mouse  like the skier  like the    year old woman    they'll wake up. A miracle  We hope not  or maybe we just hope to make miracles a little more common. Thank you very much. If you think about the phone    and Intel has tested a lot of the things I'm going to show you  over the last    years  in about     elderly households        in Ireland  and     in Portland    trying to understand  How do we measure and monitor behavior in a medically meaningful way  And if you think about the phone  right  it's something that we can use for some incredible ways to help people actually take the right medication at the right time. We're testing these kinds of simple sensor network technologies in the home so that any phone that a senior is already comfortable with can help them deal with their medications. And a lot of what they do is they pick up the phone  and it's our system whispering to them which pill they need to take  and they fake like they're having a conversation with a friend. And they're not embarrassed by a meds caddy that's ugly  that sits on their kitchen table and says   I'm old. I'm frail.  It's surreptitious technology that's helping them do a simple task of taking the right pill at the right time. Now  we also do some pretty amazing things with these phones. Because that moment when you answer the phone is a cognitive test every time that you do it. Think about it  all right  I'm going to answer the phone three different times.  Hello  Hey.  All right  That's the first time.  Hello  Uh  hey.   Hello  Uh  who  Oh  hey.  All right  Very big differences between the way I answered the phone the three times. And as we monitor phone usage by seniors over a long period of time  down to the tenths of a microsecond  that recognition moment of whether they can figure out that person on the other end is a friend and we start talking to them immediately  or they do a lot of what's called trouble talk  where they're like   Wait  who is this  Oh.  Right  Waiting for that recognition moment may be the best early indicator of the onset of dementia than anything that shows up clinically today. We call these behavioral markers. There's lots of others. Is the person going to the phone as quickly  when it rings  as they used to  Is it a hearing problem or is it a physicality problem  Has their voice gotten more quiet  We're doing a lot of work with people with Alzheimer's and particularly with Parkinson's  where that quiet voice that sometimes shows up with Parkinson's patients may be the best early indicator of Parkinson's five to    years before it shows up clinically. But those subtle changes in your voice over a long period of time are hard for you or your spouse to notice until it becomes so extreme and your voice has become so quiet. So  sensors are looking at that kind of voice. When you pick up the phone  how much tremor are you having  and what is that like  and what is that trend like over a period of time  Are you having more trouble dialing the phone than you used to  Is it a dexterity problem  Is it the onset of arthritis  Are you using the phone  Are you socializing less than you used to  And looking at that pattern. And what does that decline in social health mean  as a kind of a vital sign of the future  And then wow  what a radical idea  we    except in the United States    might be able to use this newfangled technology to actually interact with a nurse or a doctor on the other end of the line. Wow  what a great day that will be once we're allowed to actually do those kinds of things. So  these are what I would call behavioral markers. And it's the whole field that we've been trying to work on for the last    years at Intel. How do you put simple disruptive technologies  and the first of five phrases that I'm going to talk about in this talk  Behavioral markers matter. How do we change behavior  How do we measure changes in behavior in a meaningful way that's going to help us with prevention of disease  early onset of disease  and tracking the progression of disease over a long period of time  Now  why would Intel let me spend a lot of time and money  over the last    years  trying to understand the needs of seniors and start thinking about these kinds of behavioral markers  This is some of the field work that we've done. We have now lived with       elderly households in    countries over the last    years. We study people in Rochester  New York. We go live with them in the winter because what they do in the winter  and their access to healthcare  and how much they socialize  is very different than in the summer. If they have a hip fracture we go with them and we study their entire discharge experience. If they have a family member who is a key part of their care network  we fly and study them as well. So  we study the holistic health experience of       seniors over the last    years in    different countries. Why is Intel willing to fund that  It's because of the second slogan that I want to talk about. Ten years ago  when I started trying to convince Intel to let me go start looking at disruptive technologies that could help with independent living  this is what I called it   Y K     .  You know  back in       we were all so obsessed with paying attention to the aging of our computers  and whether or not they were going to survive the tick of the clock from      to       that we missed a moment that only demographers were paying attention to. It was right around New Years. And that switchover  when we had the larger number of older people on the planet  for the first time than younger people. For the first time in human history    and barring aliens landing or some major other pandemic  that's the expectation from demographers  going forward. And    years ago it seemed like I had a lot of time to convince Intel to work on this. Right  Y K      was coming  the baby boomers starting to retire. Well folks  it's like we know these demographics here. This is a map of the entire world. It's like the lights are on  but nobody's home on this demographic Y K      problem. Right  I mean we sort of get it here  but we don't get it here  and we're not doing anything about it. The health reform bill is largely ignoring the realities of the age wave that's coming  and the implications for what we need to do to change not only how we pay for care  but deliver care in some radically different ways. And in fact  it's upon us. I mean you probably saw these headlines. This is Catherine Casey who is the first boomer to actually get Social Security. That actually occurred this year. She took early retirement. She was born one second after midnight in     . A retired school teacher  there she is with a Social Security administrator. The first boomer actually  we didn't even wait till       next year. We're already starting to see early retirement occur this year. All right  so it's here. This Y K      problem is at our door. This is    tsunamis scheduled on the calendar  but somehow we can't sort of marshal our government and innovative forces to sort of get out in front of it and do something about it. We'll wait until it's more of a catastrophe  and react  as opposed to prepare for it. So  one of the reasons it's so challenging to prepare for this Y K problem is  I want to argue  we have what I would call mainframe poisoning. Andy Grove  about six or seven years ago  he doesn't even know or remember this  in a Fortune Magazine article he used the phrase  mainframe healthcare   and I've been extending and expanding this. He saw it written down somewhere. He's like   Eric that's a really cool concept.  I was like   Actually it was your idea. You said it in a Fortune Magazine article. I just extended it.  You know  this is the mainframe. This mentality of traveling to and timesharing large  expensive healthcare systems actually began in     . This is the first general hospital in Vienna. And actually the second general hospital in Vienna  in about       was where we started to build out an entire curriculum for teaching med students specialties. And it's a place in which we started developing architecture that literally divided the body  and divided care into departments and compartments. And it was reflected in our architecture  it was reflected in the way that we taught students  and this mainframe mentality persists today. Now  I'm not anti hospital. With my own healthcare problems  I've taken drug therapies  I've traveled to this hospital and others  many  many times. But we worship the high hospital on a hill. Right  And this is mainframe healthcare. And just as    years ago we couldn't conceive that we would have the power of a mainframe computer that took up a room this size in our purses and on our belts  that we're carrying around in our cell phone today  and suddenly  computing  that used to be an expert driven system  it was a personal system that we all owned as part of our daily lives    that shift from mainframe to personal computing is what we have to do for healthcare. We have to shift from this mainframe mentality of healthcare to a personal model of healthcare. We are obsessed with this way of thinking. When Intel does surveys all around the world and we say   Quick response  healthcare.  The first word that comes up is  doctor.  The second that comes up is  hospital.  And the third is  illness  or  sickness.  Right  We are wired  in our imagination  to think about healthcare and healthcare innovation as something that goes into that place. Our entire health reform discussion right now  health I.T.  when we talk with policy makers  equals  How are we going to get doctors using electronic medical records in the mainframe   We're not thinking about how do we shift from the mainframe to the home. And the problem with this is the way we conceive healthcare. Right  This is a very reactive  crisis driven system. We're doing    minute exams with patients. It's population based. We collect a bunch of biological information in this artificial setting  and we fix them up  like Humpty Dumpty all over again  and send them home  and hope    we might hand them a brochure  maybe an interactive website    that they do as asked and don't come back into the mainframe. And the problem is we can't afford it today  folks. We can't afford mainframe healthcare today to include the uninsured. And now we want to do a double double of the age wave coming through  Business as usual in healthcare is broken and we've got to do something different. We've got to focus on the home. We've got to focus on a personal healthcare paradigm that moves care to the home. How do we be more proactive  prevention driven  How do we collect vital signs and other kinds of information    by    How do we get a personal baseline about what's going to work for you  How do we collect not just biological data but behavioral data  psychological data  relational data  in and on and around the home  And how do we drive compliance to be a customized care plan that uses all this great technology that's around us to change our behavior  That's what we need to do for our personal health model. I want to give you a couple of examples. This is Mimi from one of our studies    in her   s  had to move out of her home because her family was worried about falls. Raise your hand if you had a serious fall in your household  or any of your loved ones  your parents or so forth. Right  Classic. Hip fracture often leads to institutionalization of a senior. This is what was happening to Mimi  the family was worried about it  moved her out of her own home into an assisted living facility. She tripped over her oxygen tank. Many people in this generation won't press the button  even if they have an alert call system  because they don't want to bother anybody  even though they've been paying    dollars a month. Boomers will press the button. Trust me. They're going to be pressing that button non stop. Right  Mimi broke her pelvis  lay all night  all morning  finally somebody came in and found her  sent her to the hospital. They fixed her back up. She was never going to be able to move back into the assisted living. They put her into the nursing home unit. First night in the nursing home unit where she had been in the same assisted living facility  moved her from one bed to another  kind of threw her  rebroke her pelvis  sent her back to the hospital that she had just come from  no one read the chart  put her on Tylenol  which she is allergic to  broke out  got bedsores  basically  had heart problems  and died from the fall and the complications and the errors that were there. Now  the most frightening thing about this is this is my wife's grandmother. Now  I'm Eric Dishman. I speak English  I work for Intel  I make a good salary  I'm smart about falls and fall related injuries    it's an area of research that I work on. I have access to senators and CEOs. I can't stop this from happening. What happens if you don't have money  you don't speak English or don't have the kind of access to deal with these kinds of problems that inevitably occur  How do we actually prevent the vast majority of falls from ever occurring in the first place  Let me give you a quick example of work that we're doing to try to do exactly that. I've been wearing a little technology that we call Shimmer. It's a research platform. It has accelerometry. You can plug in a three lead ECG. There is all kinds of sort of plug and play kind of Legos that you can do to capture  in the wild  in the real world  things like tremor  gait  stride length and those kinds of things. The problem is  our understanding of falls today  like Mimi  is get a survey in the mail three months after you fell  from the State  saying   What were you doing when you fell   That's sort of the state of the art. But with something like Shimmer  or we have something called the Magic Carpet  embedded sensors in carpet  or camera based systems that we borrowed from sports medicine  we're starting for the first time in those     elderly households to collect actual kinematic motion data to understand  What are the subtle changes that are occurring that can show us that mom has become risk at falls  And most often we can do two interventions  fix the meds mix. I'm a qualitative researcher  but when I look at these data streams coming in from these homes  I can look at the data and tell you the day that some doctor prescribed them something that nobody else knew that they were on  because we see the changes in their patterns in the household. Right  These discoveries of behavioral markers  and behavioral changes are game changing  and like the discovery of the microscope because of our collecting data streams that we've actually never done before. This is an example in our TRIL Clinic in Ireland of    actually what you're seeing is she's looking at data  in this picture  from the Magic Carpet. So  we have a little carpet that you can look at your amount of postural sway  and look at the changes in your postural sway over many months. Here's what some of this data might look like. This is actually sensor firings. These are two different subjects in our study. It's about a year's worth of data. The color represents different rooms they are in the house. This person on the left is living in their own home. This person on the right is actually living in an assisted living facility. I know this because look at how punctuated meal time is when they are no longer in their particular rooms here. Right  Now  this doesn't mean that much to you. But when we look at these cycles of data over a longer period of time    and we're looking at everything from motion around different rooms in the house  to sort of micro motions that Shimmer picks up  about gait and stride length    these streams of data are starting to tell us things about behavioral patterns that we've never understood before. You can go to ORCATech.org    it has nothing to do with whales  it's the Oregon Center for Aging and Technology    to see more about that. The problem is  Intel is still one of the largest funders in the world of independent living technology research. I'm not bragging about how much we fund  it's how little anyone else actually pays attention to aging and funds innovation on aging  chronic disease management and independent living in the home. So  my mantra here  my fourth slogan is         households or bust. We need to drive a national  if not international  Framingham type heart study of independent living technologies  where we have        elderly connected households with broadband  full medical characterization  and a platform by which we can start to experiment and turn these from    household anecdotal studies that the universities fund  to large clinical trials that prove out the value of these technologies. So         households or bust. These are just some of the households that we've done in the Intel studies. My fifth and final phrase  I have tried for two years  and there were moments when we were quite close  to make this healthcare reform bill be about reform from something and to something  from a mainframe model to a personal health model  or to mean something more than just a debate about the public option and how we're going to finance. It doesn't matter how we finance healthcare. We're going to figure something out for the next    years  and try it. No matter who pays for it  we better start doing care in a fundamentally different way and treating the home and the patient and the family member and the caregivers as part of these coordinated care teams and using disruptive technologies that are already here to do care in some pretty fundamental different ways. The president needs to stand up and say  at the end of a healthcare reform debate   Our goal as a country is to move    percent of care out of institutions  clinics  hospitals and nursing homes  to the home  in    years.  It's achievable. We should do it economically  we should do it morally  and we should do it for quality of life. But there is no goal within this health reform. It's just a mess today. So  you know  that's my last message to you. How do we set a going to the moon goal of dealing with the Y K     problem that's coming  It's not that innovation and technology is going to be the magic pill that cures all  but it's going to be part of the solution. And if we don't create a personal health movement  something that we're all aiming towards in reform  then we're going to move nowhere. So  I hope you'll turn this conference into that kind of movement forward. Thanks very much. I'm Jane McGonigal. I'm a game designer. I've been making games online now for    years  and my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games. Now  I have a plan for this  and it entails convincing more people  including all of you  to spend more time playing bigger and better games. Right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games. Some of you might be thinking   That's a lot of time to spend playing games. Maybe too much time  considering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world.  But actually  according to my research at the Institute for the Future  actually the opposite is true. Three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world's most urgent problems. In fact  I believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet  we need to increase that total dramatically. I've calculated the total we need at    billion hours of game play every week. So  that's probably a bit of a counter intuitive idea  so I'll say it again  let it sink in  If we want to solve problems like hunger  poverty  climate change  global conflict  obesity  I believe that we need to aspire to play games online for at least    billion hours a week  by the end of the next decade. No. I'm serious. I am. Here's why. This picture pretty much sums up why I think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species. Truly. This is a portrait by photographer Phil Toledano. He wanted to capture the emotion of gaming  so he set up a camera in front of gamers while they were playing. And this is a classic gaming emotion. Now  if you're not a gamer  you might miss some of the nuance in this photo. You probably see the sense of urgency  a little bit of fear  but intense concentration  deep  deep focus on tackling a really difficult problem. If you are a gamer  you will notice a few nuances here  the crinkle of the eyes up  and around the mouth is a sign of optimism  and the eyebrows up is surprise. This is a gamer who's on the verge of something called an  epic win.  Oh  you've heard of that. OK  good  so we have some gamers among us. An epic win is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive  you had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it. It was almost beyond the threshold of imagination  and when you get there  you're shocked to discover what you're truly capable of. That's an epic win. This is a gamer on the verge of an epic win. And this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem solvers all over the world as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century    the face of someone who  against all odds  is on the verge of an epic win. Now  unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems. This is what I call the  I'm Not Good At Life  face. This is actually me making it. Can you see  Yes. Good. This is me making the  I'm Not Good At Life  face. This is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood in Berkeley  California  where I did my PhD on why we're better in games than we are in real life. And this is a problem that a lot of gamers have. We feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games. I don't mean just good as in successful  although that's part of it. We do achieve more in game worlds. But I also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters    inspired to collaborate and to cooperate. And when we're in game worlds  I believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves    the most likely to help at a moment's notice  the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes  to get up after failure and try again. And in real life  when we face failure  when we confront obstacles  we often don't feel that way. We feel overcome  we feel overwhelmed  we feel anxious  maybe depressed  frustrated or cynical. We never have those feelings when we're playing games  they just don't exist in games. So that's what I wanted to study when I was a graduate student. What about games makes it impossible to feel that we can't achieve everything  How can we take those feelings from games and apply them to real world work  So I looked at games like World of Warcraft  which is really the ideal collaborative problem solving environment. And I started to notice a few things that make epic wins so possible in online worlds. The first thing is whenever you show up in one of these online games  especially in World of Warcraft  there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a world saving mission  right away. But not just any mission  it's a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game. Right  So you can do it. They never give you a challenge you can't achieve. But it is on the verge of what you're capable of  so you have to try hard. But there's no unemployment in World of Warcraft  no sitting around  wringing your hands    there's always something specific and important to be done. There are also tons of collaborators. Everywhere you go  hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your epic mission. That's not something we have in real life that easily  this sense that at our fingertips are tons of collaborators. And there's this epic story  this inspiring story of why we're there  and what we're doing  and we get all this positive feedback. You guys have heard of leveling up     strength     intelligence. We don't get that kind of constant feedback in real life. When I get off this stage  I'm not going to have    speaking  and    crazy idea      crazy idea. I don't get that feedback in real life. Now  the problem with collaborative online environments like World of Warcraft is that it's so satisfying to be on the verge of an epic win all the time  we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds. It's just better than reality. So  so far  collectively all the World of Warcraft gamers have spent  .   million years solving the virtual problems of Azeroth. Now  that's not necessarily a bad thing. It might sound like it's a bad thing. But to put that in context   .   million years ago was when our earliest primate human ancestors stood up. That was the first upright primate. So when we talk about how much time we're currently investing in playing games  the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution  which is an extraordinary thing. But it's also apt  because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games  we're actually changing what we are capable of as human beings. We're evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species. This is true. I believe this. So  consider this really interesting statistic  it was recently published by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University  The average young person today in a country with a strong gamer culture will have spent        hours playing online games by the age of   . Now        hours is a really interesting number for two reasons. First of all  for children in the United States         hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school  from fifth grade to high school graduation  if you have perfect attendance. So  we have an entire parallel track of education going on  where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gamer as they're learning about everything else in school. Some of you have probably read Malcolm Gladwell's new book  Outliers   so you would have heard of his theory of success  the         hours  theory of success. It's based on this great cognitive science research that says if we can master        hours of effortful study at anything by the age of     we will be virtuosos at it. We will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world. And so  now what we're looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtuoso gamers. So  the big question is   What exactly are gamers getting so good at   Because if we could figure that out  we would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands. This is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games. These are our virtuoso gamers      million people who are extraordinarily good at something. And in the next decade  we're going to have another billion gamers who are extraordinarily good at whatever that is. If you don't know it already  this is coming. The game industry is developing consoles that are low energy and that work with the wireless phone networks instead of broadband Internet  so that gamers all over the world  particularly in India  China  Brazil  can get online. They expect one billion more gamers in the next decade. It will bring us up to  .  billion gamers. So I've started to think about what these games are making us virtuosos at. Here are the four things I came up with. The first is urgent optimism. OK  think of this as extreme self motivation. Urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately to tackle an obstacle  combined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success. Gamers always believe that an epic win is possible  and that it's always worth trying  and trying now. Gamers don't sit around. Gamers are virtuosos at weaving a tight social fabric. There's a lot of interesting research that shows we like people better after we play a game with them  even if they've beaten us badly. And the reason is  it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone. We trust that they will spend their time with us  that they will play by the same rules  value the same goal  stay with the game until it's over. And so  playing a game together actually builds up bonds and trust and cooperation. And we actually build stronger social relationships as a result. Blissful productivity. I love it. You know  there's a reason why the average World of Warcraft gamer plays for    hours a week    kind of a half time job. It's because we know  when we're playing a game  that we're actually happier working hard than we are relaxing  or hanging out. We know that we are optimized as human beings  to do hard and meaningful work. And gamers are willing to work hard all the time  if they're given the right work. Finally  epic meaning. Gamers love to be attached to awe inspiring missions to human planetary scale stories. So  just one bit of trivia that helps put that into perspective  So  you all know Wikipedia  biggest wiki in the world. Second biggest wiki in the world  with nearly        articles  is the World of Warcraft wiki. Five million people use it every month. They have compiled more information about World of Warcraft on the Internet than any other topic covered on any other wiki in the world. They are building an epic story. They are building an epic knowledge resource about the World of Warcraft. Okay  so these are four superpowers that add up to one thing  Gamers are super empowered hopeful individuals. These are people who believe that they are individually capable of changing the world. And the only problem is  they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world. That's the problem that I'm trying to solve. There's an economist named Edward Castronova. His work is brilliant. He looks at why people are investing so much time and energy and money in online worlds. And he says   We're witnessing what amounts to no less than a mass exodus to virtual worlds and online game environments.  And he's an economist  so he's rational. And he says    Not like me  I'm a game designer  I'm exuberant. But he says that this makes perfect sense  because gamers can achieve more in online worlds than they can in real life. They can have stronger social relationships in games than they can have in real life  they get better feedback and feel more rewarded in games than they do in real life. So he says  for now it makes perfect sense for gamers to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world. Now  I also agree that that is rational  for now. But it is not  by any means  an optimal situation. We have to start making the real world work more like a game. I take my inspiration from something that happened       years ago. These are ancient dice  made out of sheep's knuckles. Before we had awesome game controllers  we had sheep's knuckles. And these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings  and if you're familiar with the work of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus  you might know this history  which is the history of who invented games and why. Herodotus says that games  particularly dice games  were invented in the kingdom of Lydia  during a time of famine. Apparently  there was such a severe famine that the king of Lydia decided they had to do something crazy. People were suffering. People were fighting. It was an extreme situation  they needed an extreme solution. So  according to Herodotus  they invented dice games  and they set up a kingdom wide policy  On one day  everybody would eat  and on the next day  everybody would play games. And they would be so immersed in playing the dice games  because games are so engaging  and immerse us in such satisfying  blissful productivity  they would ignore the fact that they had no food to eat. And then on the next day  they would play games  and on the next day  they would eat. And according to Herodotus  they passed    years this way  surviving through a famine  by eating on one day  and playing games on the next. Now  this is exactly  I think  how we're using games today. We're using games to escape real world suffering    we're using games to get away from everything that's broken in the real environment  everything that's not satisfying about real life  and we're getting what we need from games. But it doesn't have to end there. This is really exciting. According to Herodotus  after    years the famine wasn't getting better  so the king decided they would play one final dice game. They divided the entire kingdom in half. They played one dice game  and the winners of that game got to go on an epic adventure. They would leave Lydia  and they would go out in search of a new place to live  leaving behind just enough people to survive on the resources that were available  and hopefully to take their civilization somewhere else where they could thrive. Now  this sounds crazy  right  But recently  DNA evidence has shown that the Etruscans  who then led to the Roman Empire  actually share the same DNA as the ancient Lydians. And so  recently  scientists have suggested that Herodotus' crazy story is actually true. And geologists have found evidence of a global cooling that lasted for nearly    years  that could have explained the famine. So this crazy story might be true. They might have actually saved their culture by playing games  escaping to games for    years  and then been so inspired  and knew so much about how to come together with games  that they actually saved the entire civilization that way. Okay  we can do that. We've been playing Warcraft since     . That was the first real time strategy game from the World of Warcraft series. That was    years ago. They played dice games for    years  we've been playing Warcraft for    years. I say we are ready for our own epic game. Now  they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world  so that's where I get my    billion hours a week of game play from. Let's get half of us to agree to spend an hour a day playing games  until we solve real world problems. Now  I know you're asking   How are we going to solve real world problems in games   Well  that's what I've devoted my work to over the past few years  at the Institute for the Future. We have this banner in our offices in Palo Alto  and it expresses our view of how we should try to relate to the future. We do not want to try to predict the future. What we want to do is make the future. We want to imagine the best case scenario outcome  and then we want to empower people to make that outcome a reality. We want to imagine epic wins  and then give people the means to achieve the epic win. I'm just going to very briefly show you three games that I've made that are an attempt to give people the means to create epic wins in their own futures. This is World Without Oil. We made this game in     . This is an online game in which you try to survive an oil shortage. The oil shortage is fictional  but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it's real  and to live your real life as if we've run out of oil. So when you come to the game  you sign up  tell us where you live  and then we give you real time news videos  data feeds that show you exactly how much oil costs  what's not available  how food supply is being affected  how transportation is being affected  if schools are closed  if there's rioting  and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true. And then we ask you to blog about it  to post videos  to post photos. We piloted this game with       players in       and we've tracked them for the three years since. And I can tell you that this is a transformative experience. Nobody wants to change how they live  just because it's good for the world  or because we're supposed to. But if you immerse them in an epic adventure and tell them   We've run out of oil. This is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on. Challenge yourself to see how you would survive   most of our players have kept up the habits that they learned in this game. So for the next world saving game  we decided to aim higher    bigger problem than just peak oil. We did a game called Superstruct at the Institute for the Future. And the premise was  a supercomputer has calculated that humans have only    years left on the planet. This supercomputer was called the Global Extinction Awareness System  of course. We asked people to come online    almost like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie. You know Jerry Bruckheimer movies  you form a dream team    you've got the astronaut  the scientist  the ex convict  and they all have something to do to save the world. But in our game  instead of just having five people on the dream team  we said   Everybody's on the dream team  and it's your job to invent the future of energy  the future of food  the future of health  the future of security and the future of the social safety net.  We had       people play that game for eight weeks. They came up with     insanely creative solutions that you can go online  Google  Superstruct   and see. So  finally  the last game  we're launching it March  rd. This is a game done with the World Bank Institute. If you complete the game  you will be certified by the World Bank Institute as a Social Innovator  class of     . Working with universities all over sub Saharan Africa  and we are inviting them to learn social innovation skills. We've got a graphic novel  we've got leveling up in skills like local insight  knowledge networking  sustainability  vision and resourcefulness. I would like to invite all of you to please share this game with young people  anywhere in the world  particularly in developing areas  who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enterprises to save the world. So  I'm going to wrap up now. I want to ask a question. What do you think happens next  We've got all these amazing gamers  we've got these games that are kind of pilots of what we might do  but none of them have saved the real world yet. Well I hope you will agree with me that gamers are a human resource that we can use to do real world work  that games are a powerful platform for change. We have all these amazing superpowers  blissful productivity  the ability to weave a tight social fabric  this feeling of urgent optimism and the desire for epic meaning. I really hope that we can come together to play games that matter  to survive on this planet for another century. That's my hope  that you will join me in making and playing games like this. When I look forward to the next decade  I know two things for sure  that we can make any future we can imagine  and we can play any games we want  so I say  Let the world changing games begin. Thank you. OK. We've heard a lot of people speak at this conference about the power of the human mind. And what I'd like to do today is give you a vivid example of how that power can be unleashed when someone is in a survival situation  how the will to survive can bring that out in people. This is an incident which occurred on Mount Everest  it was the worst disaster in the history of Everest. And when it occurred  I was the only doctor on the mountain. So I'll take you through that and we'll see what it's like when someone really summons the will to survive. OK  this is Mount Everest. It's        feet high. I've been there six times  Four times I did work with National Geographic  making tectonic plate measurements  twice  I went with NASA doing remote sensing devices. It was on my fourth trip to Everest that a comet passed over the mountain. Hyakutake. And the Sherpas told us then that was a very bad omen  and we should have listened to them. Everest is an extreme environment. There's only one third as much oxygen at the summit as there is at sea level. Near the summit  temperatures can be    degrees below zero. You can have winds    to    miles an hour. It's actually a wind chill factor which is lower than a summer day on Mars. I remember one time being up near the summit  I reached into my down jacket for a drink from my water bottle  inside my down jacket  only to discover that the water was already frozen solid. That gives you an idea of just how severe things are near the summit. OK  this is the route up Everest. It starts at base camp  at        feet. Camp One        feet higher. Camp Two  another       feet higher up  what's called the Western Cwm. CampThree is at the base of Lhotse  which is the fourth highest mountain in the world  but it's dwarfed by Everest. And then Camp Four is the highest camp  that's       feet short of the summit. This is a view of base camp. This is pitched on a glacier at        feet. It's the highest point you can bring your yaks before you have to unload. And this is what they unloaded for me  I had four yak loads of medical supplies  which are dumped in a tent  and here I am trying to arrange things. This was our expedition. It was a National Geographic expedition  but it was organized by The Explorers Club. There were three other expeditions on the mountain  an American team  a New Zealand team and an IMAX team. And  after actually two months of preparation  we built our camps all the way up the mountain. This is a view looking up the icefall  the first       feet of the climb up from base camp. And here's a picture in the icefall  it's a waterfall  but it's frozen  but it moves very slowly  and it actually changes every day. When you're in it  you're like a rat in a maze  you can't even see over the top. This is near the top of the icefall. You want to climb through at night when the ice is frozen. That way  it's less likely to tumble down on you. These are some climbers reaching the top of the icefall just at sun up. This is me crossing a crevasse. We cross on aluminum ladders with safety ropes attached. That's another crevasse. Some of these things are    stories deep or more  and one of my climbing friends says that the reason we actually climb at night is because if we ever saw the bottom of what we're climbing over  we would never do it. Okay. This is Camp One. It's the first flat spot you can reach after you get up to the top of the icefall. And from there we climb up to Camp Two  which is sort of the foreground. These are climbers moving up the Lhotse face  that mountain toward Camp Three. They're on fixed ropes here. A fall here  if you weren't roped in  would be       feet down. This is a view taken from camp three. You can see the Lhotse face is in profile  it's about a    degree angle. It takes two days to climb it  so you put the camp halfway through. If you notice  the summit of Everest is black. There's no ice over it. And that's because Everest is so high  it's in the jet stream  and winds are constantly scouring the face  so no snow gets to accumulate. What looks like a cloud behind the summit ridge is actually snow being blown off the summit. This is on the way up from Camp Three to Camp Four  moving in  up through the clouds. And this is at Camp Four. Once you get to Camp Four  you have maybe    hours to decide if you're going to go for the summit or not. Everybody's on oxygen  your supplies are limited  and you either have to go up or go down  make that decision very quickly. This is a picture of Rob Hall. He was the leader of the New Zealand team. This is a radio he used later to call his wife that I'll tell you about. These are some climbers waiting to go to the summit. They're up at Camp Four  and you can see that there's wind blowing off the summit. This is not good weather to climb in  so the climbers are just waiting  hoping that the wind's going to die down. And  in fact  the wind does die down at night. It becomes very calm  there's no wind at all. This looks like a good chance to go for the summit. So here are some climbers starting out for the summit on what's called the Triangular Face. It's the first part of climb. It's done in the dark  because it's actually less steep than what comes next  and you can gain daylight hours if you do this in the dark. So that's what happened. The climbers got on the southeast ridge. This is the view looking at the southeast ridge. The summit would be in the foreground. From here  it's about       feet up at a    degree angle to the summit. But what happened that year was the wind suddenly and unexpectedly picked up. A storm blew in that no one was anticipating. You can see here some ferocious winds blowing snow way high off the summit. And there were climbers on that summit ridge. This is a picture of me in that area taken a year before  and you can see I've got an oxygen mask on with a rebreather. I have an oxygen hose connected here. You can see on this climber  we have two oxygen tanks in the backpack    little titanium tanks  very lightweight    and we're not carrying much else. This is all you've got. You're very exposed on the summit ridge. OK  this is a view taken on the summit ridge itself. This is on the way toward the summit  on that       foot bridge. All the climbers here are climbing unroped  and the reason is because the drop off is so sheer on either side that if you were roped to somebody  you'd wind up just pulling them off with you. So each person climbs individually. And it's not a straight path at all  it's very difficult climbing  and there's always the risk of falling on either side. If you fall to your left  you're going to fall       feet into Nepal  if you fall to your right  you're going to fall        feet into Tibet. So it's probably better to fall into Tibet because you'll live longer. But  either way  you fall for the rest of your life. OK. Those climbers were up near the summit  along that summit ridge that you see up there  and I was down here in Camp Three. My expedition was down in Camp Three  while these guys were up there in the storm. The storm was so fierce that we had to lay  fully dressed  fully equipped  laid out on the tent floor to stop the tent from blowing off the mountain. It was the worst winds I've ever seen. And the climbers up on the ridge were that much higher        feet higher  and completely exposed to the elements. We were in radio contact with some of them. This is a view taken along the summit ridge. Rob Hall  we heard by radio  was up here  at this point in the storm with Doug Hansen. And we heard that Rob was OK  but Doug was too weak to come down. He was exhausted  and Rob was staying with him. We also got some bad news in the storm that Beck Weathers  another climber  had collapsed in the snow and was dead. There were still    other climbers that we weren't aware of their condition. They were lost. There was total confusion on the mountain  all the stories were confusing  most of them were conflicting. We really had no idea what was going on during that storm. We were just hunkered down in our tents at Camp Three. Our two strongest climbers  Todd Burleson and Pete Athans  decided to go up to try to rescue who they could even though there was a ferocious storm going. They tried to radio a message to Rob Hall  who was a superb climber stuck  sort of  with a weak climber up near the summit. I expected them to say to Rob   Hold on. We're coming.  But in fact  what they said was   Leave Doug and come down yourself. There's no chance of saving him  and just try to save yourself at this point.  And Rob got that message  but his answer was   We're both listening.  Todd and Pete got up to the summit ridge  up in here  and it was a scene of complete chaos up there. But they did what they could to stabilize the people. I gave them radio advice from Camp Three  and we sent down the climbers that could make it down under their own power. The ones that couldn't we just sort of decided to leave up at Camp Four. So the climbers were coming down along this route. This is taken from Camp Three  where I was. And they all came by me so I could take a look at them and see what I could do for them  which is really not much  because Camp Three is a little notch cut in the ice in the middle of a    degree angle. You can barely stand outside the tent. It's really cold  it's        feet. The only supplies I had at that altitude were two plastic bags with preloaded syringes of painkiller and steroids. So  as the climbers came by me  I sort of assessed whether or not they were in condition to continue on further down. The ones that weren't that lucid or were not that well coordinated  I would give an injection of steroids to try to give them some period of lucidity and coordination where they could then work their way further down the mountain. It's so awkward to work up there that sometimes I even gave the injections right through their clothes. It was just too hard to maneuver any other way up there. While I was taking care of them  we got more news about Rob Hall. There was no way we could get up high enough to rescue him. He called in to say that he was alone now. Apparently  Doug had died higher up on the mountain. But Rob was now too weak to come down himself  and with the fierce winds and up at that altitude  he was just beyond rescue and he knew it. At that point  he asked to be paged into his wife. He was carrying a radio. His wife was home in New Zealand  seven months pregnant with their first child  and Rob asked to be patched into her. That was done  and Rob and his wife had their last conversation. They picked the name for their baby. Rob then signed off  and that was the last we ever heard of him. I was faced with treating a lot of critically ill patients at        feet  which was an impossibility. So what we did was  we got the victims down to        feet  where it was easier for me to treat them. This was my medical kit. It's a tackle box filled with medical supplies. This is what I carried up the mountain. I had more supplies lower down  which I asked to be brought up to meet me at the lower camp. And this was scene at the lower camp. The survivors came in one by one. Some of them were hypothermic  some of them were frostbitten  some were both. What we did was try to warm them up as best we could  put oxygen on them and try to revive them  which is difficult to do at        feet  when the tent is freezing. This is some severe frostbite on the feet  severe frostbite on the nose. This climber was snow blind. As I was taking care of these climbers  we got a startling experience. Out of nowhere  Beck Weathers  who we had already been told was dead  stumbled into the tent  just like a mummy  he walked into the tent. I expected him to be incoherent  but  in fact  he walked into the tent and said to me   Hi  Ken. Where should I sit   And then he said   Do you accept my health insurance   He really said that. So he was completely lucid  but he was very severely frostbitten. You can see his hand is completely white  his face  his nose  is burned. First  it turns white  and then when it's completed necrosis  it turns black  and then it falls off. It's the last stage  just like a scar. So  as I was taking care of Beck  he related what had been going on up there. He said he had gotten lost in the storm  collapsed in the snow  and just laid there  unable to move. Some climbers had come by and looked at him  and he heard them say   He's dead.  But Beck wasn't dead  he heard that  but he was completely unable to move. He was in some sort of catatonic state where he could be aware of his surroundings  but couldn't even blink to indicate that he was alive. So the climbers passed him by  and Beck lay there for a day  a night and another day  in the snow. And then he said to himself   I don't want to die. I have a family to come back to.  And the thoughts of his family  his kids and his wife  generated enough energy  enough motivation in him  so that he actually got up. After laying in the snow that long a time  he got up and found his way back to the camp. And Beck told me that story very quietly  but I was absolutely stunned by it. I couldn't imagine anybody laying in the snow that long a time and then getting up. He apparently reversed an irreversible hypothermia. And I can only try to speculate on how he did it. So  what if we had Beck hooked up to a SPECT scan  something that could actually measure brain function  Just very simply  the three parts of the brain  the frontal lobe  where you focus your attention and concentration  you have the temporal lobe  where you form images and keep memories  and the posterior part of your brain  which contains the cerebellum  which controls motion  and the brain stem  where you have your basic maintenance functions  like heartbeat and respiration. So let's take a cut through the brain here  and imagine that Beck was hooked up to a SPECT scan. This measures dynamic blood flow and therefore energy flow within the brain. So you have the prefrontal cortex here  lighting up in red. This is a pretty evenly distributed scan. You have the middle area  where the temporal lobe might be  in here  and the posterior portion  where the maintenance functions are in the back. This is a roughly normal scan  showing equal distribution of energy. Now  you go to this one and you see how much more the frontal lobes are lighting up. This might be what Beck would be experiencing when he realizes he's in danger. He's focusing all his attention on getting himself out of trouble. These parts of the brain are quieting down. He's not thinking about his family or anybody else at this point  and he's working pretty hard. He's trying to get his muscles going and get out of this. OK  but he's losing ground here. He's running out of energy. It's too cold  he can't keep his metabolic fires going  and  you see  there's no more red here  his brain is quieting down. He's collapsed in the snow here. Everything is quiet  there's very little red anywhere. Beck is powering down. He's dying. You go on to the next scan  but  in Beck's case  you can see that the middle part of his brain is beginning to light up again. He's beginning to think about his family. He's beginning to have images that are motivating him to get up. He's developing energy in this area through thought. And this is how he's going to turn thought back into action. This part of the brain is called the anterior cingulate gyrus. It's an area in which a lot of neuroscientists believe the seat of will exists. This is where people make decisions  where they develop willpower. And  you can see  there's an energy flow going from the mid portion of his brain  where he's got images of his family  into this area  which is powering his will. Okay. This is getting stronger and stronger to the point where it's actually going to be a motivating factor. He's going to develop enough energy in that area    after a day  a night and a day    to actually motivate himself to get up. And you can see here  he's starting to get more energy into the frontal lobe. He's beginning to focus  he can concentrate now. He's thinking about what he's got to do to save himself. So this energy has been transmitted up toward the front of his brain  and it's getting quieter down here  but he's using this energy to think about what he has to do to get himself going. And then  that energy is sort of spreading throughout his thought areas. He's not thinking about his family now  and he's getting himself motivated. This is the posterior part  where his muscles are going to be moving  and he's going to be pacing himself. His heart and lungs are going to pick up speed. So this is what I can speculate might have been going on had we been able to do a SPECT scan on Beck during this survival epic. So here I am taking care of Beck at        feet  and I felt what I was doing was completely trivial compared to what he had done for himself. It just shows you what the power of the mind can do. He was critically ill  there were other critically ill patients  luckily  we were able to get a helicopter in to rescue these guys. A helicopter came in at        feet and carried out the highest helicopter rescue in history. It was able to land on the ice  take away Beck and the other survivors  one by one  and get them off to Kathmandu in a clinic before we even got back to base camp. This is a scene at base camp  at one of the camps where some of the climbers were lost. And we had a memorial service there a few days later. These are Serphas lighting juniper branches. They believe juniper smoke is holy. And the climbers stood around on the high rocks and spoke of the climbers who were lost up near the summit  turning to the mountain  actually  to talk to them directly. There were five climbers lost here. This was Scott Fischer  Rob Hall  Andy Harris  Doug Hansen and Yasuko Namba. And one more climber should have died that day  but didn't  and that's Beck Weathers. He was able to survive because he was able to generate that incredible willpower  he was able to use all the power of his mind to save himself. These are Tibetan prayer flags. These Sherpas believe that if you write prayers on these flags  the message will be carried up to the gods  and that year  Beck's message was answered. Thank you. So  I was just asked to go and shoot this film called  Elizabeth.  And we're all talking about this great English icon and saying   She's a fantastic woman  she does everything. How are we going to introduce her   So we went around the table with the studio and the producers and the writer  and they came to me and said   Shekhar  what do you think   And I said   I think she's dancing.  And I could see everybody looked at me  somebody said   Bollywood.  The other said   How much did we hire him for   And the third said   Let's find another director.  I thought I had better change. So we had a lot of discussion on how to introduce Elizabeth  and I said   OK  maybe I am too Bollywood. Maybe Elizabeth  this great icon  dancing  What are you talking about   So I rethought the whole thing  and then we all came to a consensus. And here was the introduction of this great British icon called  Elizabeth.  Leicester  May I join you  my lady  Elizabeth  If it please you  sir. Shekhar Kapur  So she was dancing. So how many people who saw the film did not get that here was a woman in love  that she was completely innocent and saw great joy in her life  and she was youthful  And how many of you did not get that  That's the power of visual storytelling  that's the power of dance  that's the power of music  the power of not knowing. When I go out to direct a film  every day we prepare too much  we think too much. Knowledge becomes a weight upon wisdom. You know  simple words lost in the quicksand of experience. So I come up  and I say   What am I going to do today   I'm not going to do what I planned to do  and I put myself into absolute panic. It's my one way of getting rid of my mind  getting rid of this mind that says   Hey  you know what you're doing. You know exactly what you're doing. You're a director  you've done it for years.  So I've got to get there and be in complete panic. It's a symbolic gesture. I tear up the script  I go and I panic myself  I get scared. I'm doing it right now  you can watch me. I'm getting nervous  I don't know what to say  I don't know what I'm doing  I don't want to go there. And as I go there  of course  my A.D. says   You know what you're going to do  sir.  I say   Of course I do.  And the studio executives  they would say   Hey  look at Shekhar. He's so prepared.  And inside I've just been listening to Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan because he's chaotic. I'm allowing myself to go into chaos because out of chaos  I'm hoping some moments of truth will come. All preparation is preparation. I don't even know if it's honest. I don't even know if it's truthful. The truth of it all comes on the moment  organically  and if you get five great moments of great  organic stuff in your storytelling  in your film  your film  audiences will get it. So I'm looking for those moments  and I'm standing there and saying   I don't know what to say.  So  ultimately  everybody's looking at you      people at seven in the morning who got there at quarter to seven  and you arrived at seven  and everybody's saying   Hey. What's the first thing  What's going to happen   And you put yourself into a state of panic where you don't know  and so you don't know. And so  because you don't know  you're praying to the universe because you're praying to the universe that something    I'm going to try and access the universe the way Einstein    say a prayer    accessed his equations  the same source. I'm looking for the same source because creativity comes from absolutely the same source that you meditate somewhere outside yourself  outside the universe. You're looking for something that comes and hits you. Until that hits you  you're not going to do the first shot. So what do you do  So Cate says   Shekhar  what do you want me to do   And I say   Cate  what do you want to do    Laughter   You're a great actor  and I like to give to my actors    why don't you show me what you want to do   What am I doing  I'm trying to buy time. I'm trying to buy time. So the first thing about storytelling that I learned  and I follow all the time is  Panic. Panic is the great access of creativity because that's the only way to get rid of your mind. Get rid of your mind. Get out of it  get it out. And let's go to the universe because there's something out there that is more truthful than your mind  that is more truthful than your universe.  unclear   you said that yesterday. I'm just repeating it because that's what I follow constantly to find the shunyata somewhere  the emptiness. Out of the emptiness comes a moment of creativity. So that's what I do. When I was a kid    I was about eight years old. You remember how India was. There was no pollution. In Delhi  we used to live    we used to call it a chhat or the khota. Khota's now become a bad word. It means their terrace    and we used to sleep out at night. At school I was being just taught about physics  and I was told that if there is something that exists  then it is measurable. If it is not measurable  it does not exist. And at night I would lie out  looking at the unpolluted sky  as Delhi used to be at that time when I was a kid  and I used to stare at the universe and say   How far does this universe go   My father was a doctor. And I would think   Daddy  how far does the universe go   And he said   Son  it goes on forever.  So I said   Please measure forever because in school they're teaching me that if I cannot measure it  it does not exist. It doesn't come into my frame of reference.  So  how far does eternity go  What does forever mean  And I would lie there crying at night because my imagination could not touch creativity. So what did I do  At that time  at the tender age of seven  I created a story. What was my story  And I don't know why  but I remember the story. There was a woodcutter who's about to take his ax and chop a piece of wood  and the whole galaxy is one atom of that ax. And when that ax hits that piece of wood  that's when everything will destroy and the Big Bang will happen again. But all before that there was a woodcutter. And then when I would run out of that story  I would imagine that woodcutter's universe is one atom in the ax of another woodcutter. So every time  I could tell my story again and again and get over this problem  and so I got over the problem. How did I do it  Tell a story. So what is a story  A story is our    all of us    we are the stories we tell ourselves. In this universe  and this existence  where we live with this duality of whether we exist or not and who are we  the stories we tell ourselves are the stories that define the potentialities of our existence. We are the stories we tell ourselves. So that's as wide as we look at stories. A story is the relationship that you develop between who you are  or who you potentially are  and the infinite world  and that's our mythology. We tell our stories  and a person without a story does not exist. So Einstein told a story and followed his stories and came up with theories and came up with theories and then came up with his equations. Alexander had a story that his mother used to tell him  and he went out to conquer the world. We all  everybody  has a story that they follow. We tell ourselves stories. So  I will go further  and I say   I tell a story  and therefore I exist.  I exist because there are stories  and if there are no stories  we don't exist. We create stories to define our existence. If we do not create the stories  we probably go mad. I don't know  I'm not sure  but that's what I've done all the time. Now  a film. A film tells a story. I often wonder when I make a film    I'm thinking of making a film of the Buddha    and I often wonder  If Buddha had all the elements that are given to a director    if he had music  if he had visuals  if he had a video camera    would we get Buddhism better  But that puts some kind of burden on me. I have to tell a story in a much more elaborate way  but I have the potential. It's called subtext. When I first went to Hollywood  they said    I used to talk about subtext  and my agent came to me   Would you kindly not talk about subtext   And I said   Why   He said   Because nobody is going to give you a film if you talk about subtext. Just talk about plot and say how wonderful you'll shoot the film  what the visuals will be.  So when I look at a film  here's what we look for  We look for a story on the plot level  then we look for a story on the psychological level  then we look for a story on the political level  then we look at a story on a mythological level. And I look for stories on each level. Now  it is not necessary that these stories agree with each other. What is wonderful is  at many times  the stories will contradict with each other. So when I work with Rahman who's a great musician  I often tell him   Don't follow what the script already says. Find that which is not. Find the truth for yourself  and when you find the truth for yourself  there will be a truth in it  but it may contradict the plot  but don't worry about it.  So  the sequel to  Elizabeth    Golden Age.  When I made the sequel to  Elizabeth   here was a story that the writer was telling  A woman who was threatened by Philip II and was going to war  and was going to war  fell in love with Walter Raleigh. Because she fell in love with Walter Raleigh  she was giving up the reasons she was a queen  and then Walter Raleigh fell in love with her lady in waiting  and she had to decide whether she was a queen going to war or she wanted... Here's the story I was telling  The gods up there  there were two people. There was Philip II  who was divine because he was always praying  and there was Elizabeth  who was divine  but not quite divine because she thought she was divine  but the blood of being mortal flowed in her. But the divine one was unjust  so the gods said   OK  what we need to do is help the just one.  And so they helped the just one. And what they did was  they sent Walter Raleigh down to physically separate her mortal self from her spirit self. And the mortal self was the girl that Walter Raleigh was sent  and gradually he separated her so she was free to be divine. And the two divine people fought  and the gods were on the side of divinity. Of course  all the British press got really upset. They said   We won the Armada.  But I said   But the storm won the Armada. The gods sent the storm.  So what was I doing  I was trying to find a mythic reason to make the film. Of course  when I asked Cate Blanchett  I said   What's the film about   She said   The film's about a woman coming to terms with growing older.  Psychological. The writer said  It's about history  plot.  I said  It's about mythology  the gods.  So let me show you a film    a piece from that film    and how a camera also    so this is a scene  where in my mind  she was at the depths of mortality. She was discovering what mortality actually means  and if she is at the depths of mortality  what really happens. And she's recognizing the dangers of mortality and why she should break away from mortality. Remember  in the film  to me  both her and her lady in waiting were parts of the same body  one the mortal self and one the spirit self. So can we have that second  Elizabeth  Bess  Bess  Bess Throckmorton  Bess  Here  my lady. Elizabeth  Tell me  is it true  Are you with child  Are you with child  Bess  Yes  my lady. Elizabeth  Traitorous. You dare to keep secrets from me  You ask my permission before you rut  before you breed. My bitches wear my collars. Do you hear me  Do you hear me  Walsingham  Majesty. Please  dignity. Mercy. Elizabeth  This is no time for mercy  Walsingham. You go to your traitor brother and leave me to my business. Is it his  Tell me. Say it. Is the child his  Is it his  Bess  Yes. My lady  it is my husband's child. Elizabeth  Bitch   Cries  Raleigh  Majesty. This is not the queen I love and serve. Elizabeth  This man has seduced a ward of the queen  and she has married without royal consent. These offenses are punishable by law. Arrest him. Go. You no longer have the queen's protection. Bess  As you wish  Majesty. Elizabeth  Get out  Get out  Get out  Get out. Shekhar Kapur  So  what am I trying to do here  Elizabeth has realized  and she's coming face to face with her own sense of jealousy  her own sense of mortality. What am I doing with the architecture  The architecture is telling a story. The architecture is telling a story about how  even though she's the most powerful woman in the world at that time  there is the other  the architecture's bigger. The stone is bigger than her because stone is an organic. It'll survive her. So it's telling you  to me  stone is part of her destiny. Not only that  why is the camera looking down  The camera's looking down at her because she's in the well. She's in the absolute well of her own sense of being mortal. That's where she has to pull herself out from the depths of mortality  come in  release her spirit. And that's the moment where  in my mind  both Elizabeth and Bess are the same person. But that's the moment she's surgically removing herself from that. So the film is operating on many many levels in that scene. And how we tell stories visually  with music  with actors  and at each level it's a different sense and sometimes contradictory to each other. So how do I start all this  What's the process of telling a story  About ten years ago  I heard this little thing from a politician  not a politician that was very well respected in India. And he said that these people in the cities  in one flush  expend as much water as you people in the rural areas don't get for your family for two days. That struck a chord  and I said   That's true.  I went to see a friend of mine  and he made me wait in his apartment in Malabar Hill on the twentieth floor  which is a really  really upmarket area in Mumbai. And he was having a shower for    minutes. I got bored and left  and as I drove out  I drove past the slums of Bombay  as you always do  and I saw lines and lines in the hot midday sun of women and children with buckets waiting for a tanker to come and give them water. And an idea started to develop. So how does that become a story  I suddenly realized that we are heading towards disaster. So my next film is called  Paani  which means water. And now  out of the mythology of that  I'm starting to create a world. What kind of world do I create  and where does the idea  the design of that come  So  in my mind  in the future  they started to build flyovers. You understand flyovers  Yeah  They started to build flyovers to get from A to B faster  but they effectively went from one area of relative wealth to another area of relative wealth. And then what they did was they created a city above the flyovers. And the rich people moved to the upper city and left the poorer people in the lower cities  about    to    percent of the people have moved to the upper city. Now  where does this upper city and lower city come  There's a mythology in India about    where they say  and I'll say it in Hindi   Hindi  Right. What does that mean  It says that the rich are always sitting on the shoulders and survive on the shoulders of the poor. So  from that mythology  the upper city and lower city come. So the design has a story. And now  what happens is that the people of the upper city  they suck up all the water. Remember the word I said  suck up. They suck up all the water  keep to themselves  and they drip feed the lower city. And if there's any revolution  they cut off the water. And  because democracy still exists  there's a democratic way in which you say  Well  if you give us what  we want   we'll give you water.  So  okay my time is up. But I can go on about telling you how we evolve stories  and how stories effectively are who we are and how these get translated into the particular discipline that I am in  which is film. But ultimately  what is a story  It's a contradiction. Everything's a contradiction. The universe is a contradiction. And all of us are constantly looking for harmony. When you get up  the night and day is a contradiction. But you get up at   a.m. That first blush of blue is where the night and day are trying to find harmony with each other. Harmony is the notes that Mozart didn't give you  but somehow the contradiction of his notes suggest that. All contradictions of his notes suggest the harmony. It's the effect of looking for harmony in the contradiction that exists in a poet's mind  a contradiction that exists in a storyteller's mind. In a storyteller's mind  it's a contradiction of moralities. In a poet's mind  it's a conflict of words  in the universe's mind  between day and night. In the mind of a man and a woman  we're looking constantly at the contradiction between male and female  we're looking for harmony within each other. The whole idea of contradiction  but the acceptance of contradiction is the telling of a story  not the resolution. The problem with a lot of the storytelling in Hollywood and many films  and as  unclear  was saying in his  that we try to resolve the contradiction. Harmony is not resolution. Harmony is the suggestion of a thing that is much larger than resolution. Harmony is the suggestion of something that is embracing and universal and of eternity and of the moment. Resolution is something that is far more limited. It is finite  harmony is infinite. So that storytelling  like all other contradictions in the universe  is looking for harmony and infinity in moral resolutions  resolving one  but letting another go  letting another go and creating a question that is really important. Thank you very much. I'm going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values. Now  it's generally understood that questions of morality    questions of good and evil and right and wrong    are questions about which science officially has no opinion. It's thought that science can help us get what we value  but it can never tell us what we ought to value. And  consequently  most people    I think most people probably here    think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life  questions like   What is worth living for    What is worth dying for    What constitutes a good life   So  I'm going to argue that this is an illusion    that the separation between science and human values is an illusion    and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history. Now  it's often said that science cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values  because science deals with facts  and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres. It's often thought that there's no description of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be. But I think this is quite clearly untrue. Values are a certain kind of fact. They are facts about the well being of conscious creatures. Why is it that we don't have ethical obligations toward rocks  Why don't we feel compassion for rocks  It's because we don't think rocks can suffer. And if we're more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects  as indeed we are  it's because we think they're exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering. Now  the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim  This is something that we could be right or wrong about. And if we have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects. And there's no notion  no version of human morality and human values that I've ever come across that is not at some point reducible to a concern about conscious experience and its possible changes. Even if you get your values from religion  even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death    either to an eternity of happiness with God or an eternity of suffering in hell    you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes. And to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim  which  of course  may or may not be true. Now  to speak about the conditions of well being in this life  for human beings  we know that there is a continuum of such facts. We know that it's possible to live in a failed state  where everything that can go wrong does go wrong    where mothers cannot feed their children  where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration  where people are murdered indiscriminately. And we know that it's possible to move along this continuum towards something quite a bit more idyllic  to a place where a conference like this is even conceivable. And we know    we know    that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space. Would adding cholera to the water be a good idea  Probably not. Would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye  so that when bad things happened to them they immediately blame their neighbors  Probably not. There are truths to be known about how human communities flourish  whether or not we understand these truths. And morality relates to these truths. So  in talking about values we are talking about facts. Now  of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels    from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements. But if we're going to talk about human well being we are  of necessity  talking about the human brain. Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain    whatever happens after death. Even if the suicide bomber does get    virgins in the afterlife  in this life  his personality    his rather unfortunate personality    is the product of his brain. So the contributions of culture    if culture changes us  as indeed it does  it changes us by changing our brains. And so therefore whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings flourish can  at least in principle  be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind    neuroscience  psychology  etc. So  what I'm arguing is that value's reduced to facts    to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings. And we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beings. And I think of this as kind of a moral landscape  with peaks and valleys that correspond to differences in the well being of conscious creatures  both personal and collective. And one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well being that we rarely access  that few people access. And these await our discovery. Perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called mystical or spiritual. Perhaps there are other states that we can't access because of how our minds are structured but other minds possibly could access them. Now  let me be clear about what I'm not saying. I'm not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space  or that we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question. I don't think  for instance  that you will one day consult a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child  or whether we should bomb Iran's nuclear facilities  or whether you can deduct the full cost of TED as a business expense. But if questions affect human well being then they do have answers  whether or not we can find them. And just admitting this    just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish    will change the way we talk about morality  and will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future. For instance  there are    states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal  where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board  hard  and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin. And hundreds of thousands of children  incidentally  are subjected to this every year. The locations of these enlightened districts  I think  will fail to surprise you. We're not talking about Connecticut. And the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious. The creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod  lest we spoil the child    this is in Proverbs    and     and I believe    . But we can ask the obvious question  Is it a good idea  generally speaking  to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and good behavior  Is there any doubt that this question has an answer  and that it matters  Now  many of you might worry that the notion of well being is truly undefined  and seemingly perpetually open to be re construed. And so  how therefore can there be an objective notion of well being  Well  consider by analogy  the concept of physical health. The concept of physical health is undefined. As we just heard from Michael Specter  it has changed over the years. When this statue was carved the average life expectancy was probably   . It's now around    in the developed world. There may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that not being able to run a marathon at age     will be considered a profound disability. People will send you donations when you're in that condition. Notice that the fact that the concept of health is open  genuinely open for revision  does not make it vacuous. The distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science. Another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape  There may be equivalent ways to thrive  there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing. Now  why wouldn't this undermine an objective morality  Well think of how we talk about food  I would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat. There is clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food. But there's nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison. The fact that there are many right answers to the question   What is food   does not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition. Many people worry that a universal morality would require moral precepts that admit of no exceptions. So  for instance  if it's really wrong to lie  it must always be wrong to lie  and if you can find an exception  well then there's no such thing as moral truth. Why would we think this  Consider  by analogy  the game of chess. Now  if you're going to play good chess  a principle like   Don't lose your Queen   is very good to follow. But it clearly admits some exceptions. There are moments when losing your Queen is a brilliant thing to do. There are moments when it is the only good thing you can do. And yet  chess is a domain of perfect objectivity. The fact that there are exceptions here does not change that at all. Now  this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere. Consider the great problem of women's bodies  What to do about them  Well this is one thing you can do about them  You can cover them up. Now  it is the position  generally speaking  of our intellectual community that while we may not like this  we might think of this as  wrong  in Boston or Palo Alto  who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags  And who are we to say  even  that they're wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable  or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way  Well  who are we not to say this  Who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well being that we have to be non judgmental about a practice like this  I'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil    women should be able to wear whatever they want  as far as I'm concerned. But what does voluntary mean in a community where  when a girl gets raped  her father's first impulse  rather often  is to murder her out of shame  Just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute  Your daughter gets raped  and what you want to do is kill her. What are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing  Now  to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society. For instance  this is what it's like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized world. Now  granted  for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images. But if we are in a reflective mood  we can ask   Is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women's bodies   I mean  is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children  Probably not. OK  so perhaps there's some place on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of better balance. Perhaps there are many such places    again  given other changes in human culture there may be many peaks on the moral landscape. But the thing to notice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a peak. Now the irony  from my perspective  is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another. And of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind  not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well being. In fact  the endurance of religion as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering. This is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue. But the demagogues are right about one thing  We need a universal conception of human values. Now  what stands in the way of this  Well  one thing to notice is that we do something different when talking about morality    especially secular  academic  scientist types. When talking about morality we value differences of opinion in a way that we don't in any other area of our lives. So  for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion  and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness. On the other hand  we have someone like Ted Bundy  Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping and torturing and killing young women. So  we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one's time. Most Western intellectuals look at this situation and say   Well  there's nothing for the Dalai Lama to be really right about    really right about    or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about that admits of a real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science. He likes chocolate  he likes vanilla. There's nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other.  Notice that we don't do this in science. On the left you have Edward Witten. He's a string theorist. If you ask the smartest physicists around who is the smartest physicist around  in my experience half of them will say Ed Witten. The other half will tell you they don't like the question. So  what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference and said  String theory is bogus. It doesn't resonate with me. It's not how I chose to view the universe at a small scale. I'm not a fan.  Well  nothing would happen because I'm not a physicist  I don't understand string theory. I'm the Ted Bundy of string theory. I wouldn't want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member. But this is just the point. Whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded. That is what it is to have a domain of expertise. That is what it is for knowledge to count. How have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise  or moral talent  or moral genius even  How have we convinced ourselves that every opinion has to count  How have we convinced ourselves that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering  Does the Taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering  No. How is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well being  So  this  I think  is what the world needs now. It needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing  and morality relates to that domain of facts. It is possible for individuals  and even for whole cultures  to care about the wrong things  which is to say that it's possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead to needless human suffering. Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality. We live in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less  and they will one day mean nothing. We live in a world filled with destructive technology  and this technology cannot be uninvented  it will always be easier to break things than to fix them. It seems to me  therefore  patently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast differences in notions of human well being than we can respect or tolerate vast differences in the notions about how disease spreads  or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes. We simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life. And to do that  we have to admit that these questions have answers. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  So  some combustible material there. Whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world  hearing some of this  may well be doing the screaming with rage thing  after as well  some of them. Language seems to be really important here. When you're talking about the veil  you're talking about women dressed in cloth bags. I've lived in the Muslim world  spoken with a lot of Muslim women. And some of them would say something else. They would say   No  you know  this is a celebration of female specialness  it helps build that and it's a result of the fact that     and this is arguably a sophisticated psychological view     that male lust is not to be trusted.  I mean  can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without seeming kind of cultural imperialist  Sam Harris  Yeah  well I think I tried to broach this in a sentence  watching the clock ticking  but the question is  What is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations  and you're guaranteed to be treated in a certain way if you don't veil yourself  And so  if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil  or a very funny hat  or tattoo their face    I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want  but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under. And so I think we shouldn't be so eager to always take their word for it  especially when it's     degrees out and you're wearing a full burqa. CA  A lot of people want to believe in this concept of moral progress. But can you reconcile that  I think I understood you to say that you could reconcile that with a world that doesn't become one dimensional  where we all have to think the same. Paint your picture of what rolling the clock    years forward      years forward  how you would like to think of the world  balancing moral progress with richness. SH  Well  I think once you admit that we are on the path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some important detail  then you have to admit that we are going to understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail. So  we're going to understand positive social emotion like empathy and compassion  and we're going to understand the factors that encourage it    whether they're genetic  whether they're how people talk to one another  whether they're economic systems  and insofar as we begin to shine light on that we are inevitably going to converge on that fact space. So  everything is not going to be up for grabs. It's not going to be like veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as teaching her to be confident and well educated in the context of men who do desire women. I mean I don't think we need an NSF grant to know that compulsory veiling is a bad idea    but at a certain point we're going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved and actually interrogate them. Do people love their daughters just as much in these systems  And I think there are clearly right answers to that. CA  And if the results come out that actually they do  are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment on some of these issues  SH  Well yeah  modulo one obvious fact  that you can love someone in the context of a truly delusional belief system. So  you can say like   Because I knew my gay son was going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend  I chopped his head off. And that was the most compassionate thing I could do.  If you get all those parts aligned  yes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love. But again  then we have to talk about well being in a larger context. It's all of us in this together  not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus. CA  Sam  this is a conversation I would actually love to continue for hours. We don't have that  but maybe another time. Thank you for coming to TED. SH  Really an honor. Thank you. Illegal wildlife trade in Brazil is one of the major threats against our fauna  especially birds  and mainly to supply the pet market with thousands of animals taken from nature every month  and transported far from their origins  to be sold mainly in Rio de Janeiro and S o Paulo. It is estimated that all kinds of illegal wildlife trade in Brazil withdraw from nature almost    million animals every year  a business worth almost two billion dollars. The police intercepts these huge cargos with live animals  intended to supply the pet market  or they seize the animals directly from the people's houses  and this is how we end up  every month  with thousands of seized animals. And for us to understand what happens with them  we're going to follow Brad. In the eyes of many people  after the animals are seized  they say   Yay  justice has been served. The good guys arrived  took the cute  mistreated animals from the hands of the evil traffickers  and everyone lived happily ever after.  But did they  Actually  no  and this is where many of our problems begin. Because we have to figure out what to do with all these animals. In Brazil  they are usually first sent to governmental triage facilities  in which most of the cases  the conditions are as bad as with the traffickers. In       these centers received        animals  of which        were birds. And the police estimates that we seize only five percent of what's being trafficked. Some lucky ones    and among them  Brad    go to serious rehabilitation centers after that. And in these places they are cared for. They train their flying  they learn how to recognize the food they will find in nature  and they are able to socialize with others from the same species. But then what  The Brazil Ornithological Society    so now we're talking only birds    claims that we have too little knowledge about the species in nature. Therefore  it would be too risky to release these animals  both for the released and for the natural populations. They also claim that we spend too many resources in their rehabilitation. Following this argument  they suggest that all the birds seized from non threatened species should be euthanized. However  this would mean having killed        birds  only in the state of S o Paulo  only in     . But  some researchers  myself included    some NGOs and some people from the Brazilian government    believe there is an alternative. We think that if and when the animals meet certain criteria concerning their health  behavior  inferred origin and whatever we know about the natural populations  then technically responsible releases are possible  both for the well being of the individual  and for the conservation of the species and their ecosystems  because we will be returning genes for these populations    which could be important for them in facing environmental challenges    and also we could be returning potential seed dispersers  predators  preys  etc. All of these were released by us. On the top  the turtles are just enjoying freedom. On the middle  this guy nested a couple of weeks after the release. And on the bottom  my personal favorite  the little male over there  four hours after his release he was together with a wild female. So  this is not new  people have been doing this around the world. But it's still a big issue in Brazil. We believe we have performed responsible releases. We've registered released animals mating in nature and having chicks. So  these genes are indeed going back to the populations. However this is still a minority for the very lack of knowledge. So  I say   Let's study more  let's shed light on this issue  let's do whatever we can.  I'm devoting my career to that. And I'm here to urge each and every one of you to do whatever is in your reach  Talk to your neighbor  teach your children  make sure your pet is from a legal breeder. We need to act  and act now  before these ones are the only ones left. Thank you very much. So  basically we have public leaders  public officials who are out of control  they are writing bills that are unintelligible  and out of these bills are going to come maybe        pages of regulations  total complexity  which has a dramatically negative impact on our life. If you're a veteran coming back from Iraq or Vietnam you face a blizzard of paperwork to get your benefits  if you're trying to get a small business loan  you face a blizzard of paperwork. What are we going to do about it  I define simplicity as a means to achieving clarity  transparency and empathy  building humanity into communications. I've been simplifying things for    years. I come out of the advertising and design business. My focus is understanding you people  and how you interact with the government to get your benefits  how you interact with corporations to decide whom you're going to do business with  and how you view brands. So  very quickly  when President Obama said   I don't see why we can't have a one page  plain English consumer credit agreement.  So  I locked myself in a room  figured out the content  organized the document  and wrote it in plain English. I've had this checked by the two top consumer credit lawyers in the country. This is a real thing. Now  I went one step further and said   Why do we have to stick with the stodgy lawyers and just have a paper document  Let's go online.  And many people might need help in computation. Working with the Harvard Business School  you'll see this example when you talk about minimum payment  If you spent    dollars for a meal  the longer you take to pay out that loan  you see  over a period of time using the minimum payment it's    dollars and    cents. How about that  Do you think your bank is going to show that to people  But it's going to work. It's more effective than just computational aids. And what about terms like  over the limit   Perhaps a stealth thing. Define it in context. Tell people what it means. When you put it in plain English  you almost force the institution to give the people a way  a default out of that  and not put themselves at risk. Plain English is about changing the content. And one of the things I'm most proud of is this agreement for IBM. It's a grid  it's a calendar. At such and such a date  IBM has responsibilities  you have responsibilities. Received very favorably by business. And there is some good news to report today. Each year  one in    taxpayers receives a notice from the IRS. There are     million letters that go out. Running through this typical letter that they had  I ran it through my simplicity lab  it's pretty unintelligible. All the parts of the document in red are not intelligible. We looked at doing over       letters that cover    percent of their transactions in plain English. They have been tested in the laboratory. When I run it through my lab  this heat mapping shows everything is intelligible. And the IRS has introduced the program. There are a couple of things going on right now that I want to bring to your attention. There is a lot of discussion now about a consumer financial protection agency  how to mandate simplicity. We see all this complexity. It's incumbent upon us  and this organization  I believe  to make clarity  transparency and empathy a national priority. There is no way that we should allow government to communicate the way they communicate. There is no way we should do business with companies that have agreements with stealth provisions and that are unintelligible. So  how are we going to change the world  Make clarity  transparency and simplicity a national priority. I thank you. I want to talk about  .  billion years of history in    minutes. That's     million years per minute. Let's start with the first photograph NASA obtained of planet Mars. This is fly by  Mariner IV. It was taken in     . When this picture appeared  that well known scientific journal  The New York Times  wrote in its editorial   Mars is uninteresting. It's a dead world. NASA should not spend any time or effort studying Mars anymore.  Fortunately  our leaders in Washington at NASA headquarters knew better and we began a very extensive study of the red planet. One of the key questions in all of science   Is there life outside of Earth   I believe that Mars is the most likely target for life outside the Earth. I'm going to show you in a few minutes some amazing measurements that suggest there may be life on Mars. But let me start with a Viking photograph. This is a composite taken by Viking in     . Viking was developed and managed at the NASA Langley Research Center. We sent two orbiters and two landers in the summer of     . We had four spacecraft  two around Mars  two on the surface    an amazing accomplishment. This is the first photograph taken from the surface of any planet. This is a Viking Lander photograph of the surface of Mars. And yes  the red planet is red. Mars is half the size of the Earth  but because two thirds of the Earth is covered by water  the land area on Mars is comparable to the land area on Earth. So  Mars is a pretty big place even though it's half the size. We have obtained topographic measurements of the surface of Mars. We understand the elevation differences. We know a lot about Mars. Mars has the largest volcano in the solar system  Olympus Mons. Mars has the Grand Canyon of the solar system  Valles Marineris. Very  very interesting planet. Mars has the largest impact crater in the solar system  Hellas Basin. This is       miles across. If you happened to be on Mars when this impactor hit  it was a really bad day on Mars. This is Olympus Mons. This is bigger than the state of Arizona. Volcanoes are important  because volcanoes produce atmospheres and they produce oceans. We're looking at Valles Marineris  the largest canyon in the solar system  superimposed on a map of the United States        miles across. One of the most intriguing features about Mars  the National Academy of Science says one of the    major mysteries of the space age  is why certain areas of Mars are so highly magnetized. We call this crustal magnetism. There are regions on Mars  where  for some reason    we don't understand why at this point    the surface is very  very highly magnetized. Is there water on Mars  The answer is no  there is no liquid water on the surface of Mars today. But there is intriguing evidence that suggests that the early history of Mars there may have been rivers and fast flowing water. Today Mars is very very dry. We believe there's some water in the polar caps  there are polar caps of North Pole and South Pole. Here are some recent images. This is from Spirit and Opportunity. These images that show at one time  there was very fast flowing water on the surface of Mars. Why is water important  Water is important because if you want life you have to have water. Water is the key ingredient in the evolution  the origin of life on a planet. Here is some picture of Antarctica and a picture of Olympus Mons  very similar features  glaciers. So  this is frozen water. This is ice water on Mars. This is my favorite picture. This was just taken a few weeks ago. It has not been seen publicly. This is European space agency Mars Express  image of a crater on Mars and in the middle of the crater we have liquid water  we have ice. Very intriguing photograph. We now believe that in the early history of Mars  which is  .  billion years ago   .  billion years ago  Mars was very Earth like. Mars had rivers  Mars had lakes  but more important Mars had planetary scale oceans. We believe that the oceans were in the northern hemisphere  and this area in blue  which shows a depression of about four miles  was the ancient ocean area on the surface of Mars. Where did the ocean's worth of water on Mars go  Well  we have an idea. This is a measurement we obtained a few years ago from a Mars orbiting satellite called Odyssey. Sub surface water on Mars  frozen in the form of ice. And this shows the percent. If it's a blueish color  it means    percent by weight. Sixteen percent  by weight  of the interior contains frozen water  or ice. So  there is a lot of water below the surface. The most intriguing and puzzling measurement  in my opinion  we've obtained of Mars  was released earlier this year in the magazine Science. And what we're looking at is the presence of the gas methane  CH   in the atmosphere of Mars. And you can see there are three distinct regions of methane. Why is methane important  Because on Earth  almost all      .  percent    of the methane is produced by living systems  not little green men  but microscopic life below the surface or at the surface. We now have evidence that methane is in the atmosphere of Mars  a gas that  on Earth  is biogenic in origin  produced by living systems. These are the three plumes  A  B   B . And this is the terrain it appears over  and we know from geological studies that these regions are the oldest regions on Mars. In fact  the Earth and Mars are both  .  billion years old. The oldest rock on Earth is only  .  billion. The reason there is a billion year gap in our geological understanding is because of plate tectonics  The crust of the Earth has been recycled. We have no geological record prior for the first billion years. That record exists on Mars. And this terrain that we're looking at dates back to  .  billion years when Earth and Mars were formed. It was a Tuesday. This is a map that shows where we've put our spacecraft on the surface of Mars. Here is Viking I  Viking II. This is Opportunity. This is Spirit. This is Mars Pathfinder. This is Phoenix  we just put two years ago. Notice all of our rovers and all of our landers have gone to the northern hemisphere. That's because the northern hemisphere is the region of the ancient ocean basin. There aren't many craters. And that's because the water protected the basin from being impacted by asteroids and meteorites. But look in the southern hemisphere. In the southern hemisphere there are impact craters  there are volcanic craters. Here's Hellas Basin  a very very different place  geologically. Look where the methane is  the methane is in a very rough terrain area. What is the best way to unravel the mysteries on Mars that exist  We asked this question    years ago. We invited    of the top Mars scientists to the Langley Research Center for two days. We addressed on the board the major questions that have not been answered. And we spent two days deciding how to best answer this question. And the result of our meeting was a robotic rocket powered airplane we call ARES. It's an Aerial Regional scale Environmental Surveyor. There's a model of ARES here. This is a    percent scale model. This airplane was designed at the Langley Research Center. If any place in the world can build an airplane to fly on Mars  it's the Langley Research Center  for almost     years a leading center of aeronautics in the world. We fly about a mile above the surface. We cover hundreds of miles  and we fly about     miles an hour. We can do things that rovers can't do and landers can't do  We can fly above mountains  volcanoes  impact craters  we fly over valleys  we can fly over surface magnetism  the polar caps  subsurface water  and we can search for life on Mars. But  of equal importance  as we fly through the atmosphere of Mars  we transmit that journey  the first flight of an airplane outside of the Earth  we transmit those images back to Earth. And our goal is to inspire the American public who is paying for this mission through tax dollars. But more important we will inspire the next generation of scientists  technologists  engineers and mathematicians. And that's a critical area of national security and economic vitality  to make sure we produce the next generation of scientists  engineers  mathematicians and technologists. This is what ARES looks like as it flies over Mars. We preprogram it. We will fly where the methane is. We will have instruments aboard the plane that will sample  every three minutes  the atmosphere of Mars. We will look for methane as well as other gasses produced by living systems. We will pinpoint where these gases emanate from  because we can measure the gradient where it comes from  and there  we can direct the next mission to land right in that area. How do we transport an airplane to Mars  In two words  very carefully. The problem is we don't fly it to Mars  we put it in a spacecraft and we send it to Mars. The problem is the spacecraft's largest diameter is nine feet  ARES is    foot wingspan     feet long. How do we get it to Mars  We fold it  and we transport it in a spacecraft. And we have it in something called an aeroshell. This is how we do it. And we have a little video that describes the sequence. Video  Seven  six. Green board. Five  four  three  two  one. Main engine start  and liftoff. Joel Levine  This is a launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. This is the spacecraft taking nine months to get to Mars. It enters the atmosphere of Mars. A lot of heating  frictional heating. It's going    thousand miles an hour. A parachute opens up to slow it down. The thermal tiles fall off. The airplane is exposed to the atmosphere for the first time. It unfolds. The rocket engine begins. We believe that in a one hour flight we can rewrite the textbook on Mars by making high resolution measurements of the atmosphere  looking for gases of biogenic origin  looking for gases of volcanic origin  studying the surface  studying the magnetism on the surface  which we don't understand  as well as about a dozen other areas. Practice makes perfect. How do we know we can do it  Because we have tested ARES model  several models in a half a dozen wind tunnels at the NASA Langley Research Center for eight years  under Mars conditions. And  of equal importance is  we test ARES in the Earth's atmosphere  at         feet  which is comparable to the density and pressure of the atmosphere on Mars where we'll fly. Now          feet  if you fly cross country to Los Angeles  you fly        feet. We do our tests at         feet. And I want to show you one of our tests. This is a half scale model. This is a high altitude helium balloon. This is over Tilamook  Oregon. We put the folded airplane on the balloon    it took about three hours to get up there    and then we released it on command at         feet  and we deploy the airplane and everything works perfectly. And we've done high altitude and low altitude tests  just to perfect this technique. We're ready to go. I have a scale model here. But we have a full scale model in storage at the NASA Langley Research Center. We're ready to go. All we need is a check from NASA headquarters to cover the costs. I'm prepared to donate my honorarium for today's talk for this mission. There's actually no honorarium for anyone for this thing. This is the ARES team  we have about     scientists  engineers  where we're working with Jet Propulsion Laboratory  Goddard Space Flight Center  Ames Research Center and half a dozen major universities and corporations in developing this. It's a large effort. It's all at NASA Langley Research Center. And let me conclude by saying not too far from here  right down the road in Kittyhawk  North Carolina  a little more than     years ago history was made when we had the first powered flight of an airplane on Earth. We are on the verge right now to make the first flight of an airplane outside the Earth's atmosphere. We are prepared to fly this on Mars  rewrite the textbook about Mars. If you're interested in more information  we have a website that describes this exciting and intriguing mission  and why we want to do it. Thank you very much. One day  Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez was walking along the streets of downtown Los Angeles when he heard beautiful music. And the source was a man  an African American man  charming  rugged  homeless  playing a violin that only had two strings. And I'm telling a story that many of you know  because Steve's columns became the basis for a book  which was turned into a movie  with Robert Downey Jr. acting as Steve Lopez  and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers  the Juilliard trained double bassist whose promising career was cut short by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia. Nathaniel dropped out of Juilliard  he suffered a complete breakdown  and    years later he was living homeless on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles. I encourage all of you to read Steve's book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bond that formed between these two men  but how music helped shape that bond  and ultimately was instrumental    if you'll pardon the pun    in helping Nathaniel get off the streets. I met Mr. Ayers in       two years ago  at Walt Disney Concert Hall. He had just heard a performance of Beethoven's First and Fourth symphonies  and came backstage and introduced himself. He was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way about Yo Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton and how the Dodgers were never going to make the World Series  all because of the treacherous first violin passage work in the last movement of Beethoven's Fourth Symphony. And we got talking about music  and I got an email from Steve a few days later saying that Nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me. Now  I should mention that Nathaniel refuses treatment because when he was treated it was with shock therapy and Thorazine and handcuffs  and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life. But as a result now  he is prone to these schizophrenic episodes  the worst of which can manifest themselves as him exploding and then disappearing for days  wandering the streets of Skid Row  exposed to its horrors  with the torment of his own mind unleashed upon him. And Nathaniel was in such a state of agitation when we started our first lesson at Walt Disney Concert Hall    he had a kind of manic glint in his eyes  he was lost. And he was talking about invisible demons and smoke  and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep. And I was afraid  not for myself  but I was afraid that I was going to lose him  that he was going to sink into one of his states  and that I would ruin his relationship with the violin if I started talking about scales and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin pedagogy. So  I just started playing. And I played the first movement of the Beethoven Violin Concerto. And as I played  I understood that there was a profound change occurring in Nathaniel's eyes. It was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical  a chemical reaction  for which my playing the music was its catalyst. And Nathaniel's manic rage was transformed into understanding  a quiet curiosity and grace. And in a miracle  he lifted his own violin and he started playing  by ear  certain snippets of violin concertos which he then asked me to complete    Mendelssohn  Tchaikovsky  Sibelius. And we started talking about music  from Bach to Beethoven and Brahms  Bruckner  all the B's  from Bart k  all the way up to Esa Pekka Salonen. And I understood that he not only had an encyclopedic knowledge of music  but he related to this music at a personal level. He spoke about it with the kind of passion and understanding that I share with my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic. And through playing music and talking about music  this man had transformed from the paranoid  disturbed man that had just come from walking the streets of downtown Los Angeles to the charming  erudite  brilliant  Juilliard trained musician. Music is medicine. Music changes us. And for Nathaniel  music is sanity. Because music allows him to take his thoughts and delusions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity  into reality. And that is an escape from his tormented state. And I understood that this was the very essence of art. This was the very reason why we made music  that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental core  our emotions  and through our artistic lens  through our creativity  we're able to shape those emotions into reality. And the reality of that expression reaches all of us and moves us  inspires and unites us. And for Nathaniel  music brought him back into a fold of friends. The redemptive power of music brought him back into a family of musicians that understood him  that recognized his talents and respected him. And I will always make music with Nathaniel  whether we're at Walt Disney Concert Hall or on Skid Row  because he reminds me why I became a musician. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Thank you. Thanks. Robert Gupta. Robert Gupta  I'm going to play something that I shamelessly stole from cellists. So  please forgive me. You know for me  the interest in contemporary forms of slavery started with a leaflet that I picked up in London. It was the early '  s  and I was at a public event. I saw this leaflet and it said   There are millions of slaves in the world today.  And I thought   No way  no way.  And I'm going to admit to hubris. Because I also  I'm going to admit to you  I also thought   How can I be like a hot shot young full professor who teaches human rights and not know this  So it can't be true.  Well  if you teach  if you worship in the temple of learning  do not mock the gods  because they will take you  fill you with curiosity and desire  and drive you. Drive you with a passion to change things. I went out and did a lit review        articles on the key word  slavery.  Two turned out to be about contemporary    only two. All the rest were historical. They were press pieces and they were full of outrage  they were full of speculation  they were anecdotal    no solid information. So  I began to do a research project of my own. I went to five countries around the world. I looked at slaves. I met slaveholders  and I looked very deeply into slave based businesses because this is an economic crime. People do not enslave people to be mean to them. They do it to make a profit. And I've got to tell you  what I found out in the world in four different continents  was depressingly familiar. Like this  Agricultural workers in Africa  whipped and beaten  showing us how they were beaten in the fields before they escaped from slavery and met up with our film crew. It was mind blowing. And I want to be very clear. I'm talking about real slavery. This is not about lousy marriages  this is not about jobs that suck. This is about people who can not walk away  people who are forced to work without pay  people who are operating      under a threat of violence and have no pay. It's real slavery in exactly the same way that slavery would be recognized throughout all of human history. Now  where is it  Well  this map in the sort of redder  yellower colors are the places with the highest densities of slavery. But in fact that kind of bluey color are the countries where we can't find any cases of slavery. And you might notice that it's only Iceland and Greenland where we can't find any cases of enslavement around the world. We're also particularly interested and looking very carefully at places where slaves are being used to perpetrate extreme environmental destruction. Around the world  slaves are used to destroy the environment  cutting down trees in the Amazon  destroying forest areas in West Africa  mining and spreading mercury around in places like Ghana and the Congo  destroying the coastal ecosystems in South Asia. It's a pretty harrowing linkage between what's happening to our environment and what's happening to our human rights. Now  how on Earth did we get to a situation like this  where we have    million people in slavery in the year       That's double the number that came out of Africa in the entire transatlantic slave trade. Well  it builds up with these factors. They are not causal  they are actually supporting factors. One we all know about  the population explosion  the world goes from two billion people to almost seven billion people in the last    years. Being numerous does not make you a slave. Add in the increased vulnerability of very large numbers of people in the developing world  caused by civil wars  ethnic conflicts  kleptocratic governments  disease ... you name it  you know it. We understand how that works. In some countries all of those things happen at once  like Sierra Leone a few years ago  and push enormous parts ... about a billion people in the world  in fact  as we know  live on the edge  live in situations where they don't have any opportunity and are usually even destitute. But that doesn't make you a slave either. What it takes to turn a person who is destitute and vulnerable into a slave  is the absence of the rule of law. If the rule of law is sound  it protects the poor and it protects the vulnerable. But if corruption creeps in and people don't have the opportunity to have that protection of the rule of law  then if you can use violence  if you can use violence with impunity  you can reach out and harvest the vulnerable into slavery. Well  that is precisely what has happened around the world. Though  for a lot of people  the people who step into slavery today don't usually get kidnapped or knocked over the head. They come into slavery because someone has asked them this question. All around the world I've been told an almost identical story. People say   I was home  someone came into our village  they stood up in the back of a truck  they said  'I've got jobs  who needs a job '  And they did exactly what you or I would do in the same situation. They said   That guy looked sketchy. I was suspicious  but my children were hungry. We needed medicine. I knew I had to do anything I could to earn some money to support the people I care about.  They climb into the back of the truck. They go off with the person who recruits them. Ten miles      miles        miles later  they find themselves in dirty  dangerous  demeaning work. They take it for a little while  but when they try to leave  bang   the hammer comes down  and they discover they're enslaved. Now  that kind of slavery is  again  pretty much what slavery has been all through human history. But there is one thing that is particularly remarkable and novel about slavery today  and that is a complete collapse in the price of human beings    expensive in the past  dirt cheap now. Even the business programs have started picking up on this. I just want to share a little clip for you. Daphne  OK. Llively discussion guaranteed here  as always  as we get macro and talk commodities. Continuing here in the studio with our guest Michael O'Donohue  head of commodities at Four Continents Capital Management. And we're also joined by Brent Lawson from Lawson Frisk Securities. Brent Lawson  Happy to be here. D  Good to have you with us  Brent. Now  gentlemen ... Brent  where is your money going this year  BL  Well Daphne  we've been going short on gas and oil recently and casting our net just a little bit wider. We really like the human being story a lot. If you look at a long term chart  prices are at historical lows and yet global demand for forced labor is still real strong. So  that's a scenario that we think we should be capitalizing on. D  Michael  what's your take on the people story  Are you interested  Michael O'Donoghue  Oh definitely. Non voluntary labor's greatest advantage as an asset is the endless supply. We're not about to run out of people. No other commodity has that. BL  Daphne  if I may draw your attention to one thing. That is that private equity has been sniffing around  and that tells me that this market is about to explode. Africans and Indians  as usual  South Americans  and Eastern Europeans in particular are on our buy list. D  Interesting. Micheal  bottom line  what do you recommend  MO  We're recommending to our clients a buy and hold strategy. There's no need to play the market. There's a lot of vulnerable people out there. It's very exciting. D  Exciting stuff indeed. Gentlemen  thank you very much. Kevin Bales  Okay  you figured it out. That's a spoof. Though I enjoyed watching your jaws drop  drop  drop  until you got it. MTV Europe worked with us and made that spoof  and they've been slipping it in between music videos without any introduction  which I think is kind of fun. Here's the reality. The price of human beings across the last       years in today's money has averaged about        dollars. Capital purchase items. You can see that the lines cross when the population explodes. The average price of a human being today  around the world  is about    dollars. They are more expensive in places like North America. Slaves cost between       to       dollars in North America  but I could take you places in India or Nepal where human beings can be acquired for five or    dollars. They key here is that people have ceased to be that capital purchase item and become like Styrofoam cups. You buy them cheaply  you use them  you crumple them up  and then when you're done with them you just throw them away. These young boys are in Nepal. They are basically the transport system on a quarry run by a slaveholder. There are no roads there  so they carry loads of stone on their backs  often of their own weight  up and down the Himalaya Mountains. One of their mothers said to us   You know  we can't survive here  but we can't even seem to die either.  It's a horrible situation. And if there is anything that makes me feel very positive about this  it's that there are also    in addition to young men like this who are still enslaved    there are ex slaves who are now working to free others. Or  we say  Frederick Douglass is in the house. I don't know if you've ever had a daydream about   Wow. What would it be like to meet Harriet Tubman  What would it be like to meet Frederick Douglass   I've got to say  one of the most exciting parts about my job is that I get to  and I want to introduce you to one of those. His name is James Kofi Annan. He was a slave child in Ghana enslaved in the fishing industry  and he now  after escape and building a new life  has formed an organization that we work closely with to go back and get people out of slavery. This is not James  this is one of the kids that he works with. James Kofi Annan  Video   He was hit with a paddle in the head. And this reminds me of my childhood when I used to work here. KB  James and our country director in Ghana  Emmanuel Otoo are now receiving regular death threats because the two of them managed to get convictions and imprisonment for three human traffickers for the very first time in Ghana for enslaving people  from the fishing industry  for enslaving children. Now  everything I've been telling you  I admit  is pretty disheartening. But there is actually a very positive side to this  and that is this  The    million people who are in slavery today  that's a lot of people  but it's also the smallest fraction of the global population to ever be in slavery. And likewise  the    billion dollars that they generate into the global economy each year is the tiniest proportion of the global economy to ever be represented by slave labor. Slavery  illegal in every country has been pushed to the edges of our global society. And in a way  without us even noticing  has ended up standing on the precipice of its own extinction  waiting for us to give it a big boot and knock it over. And get rid of it. And it can be done. Now  if we do that  if we put the resources and the focus to it  what does it actually cost to get people out of slavery  Well  first  before I even tell you the cost I've got to be absolutely clear. We do not buy people out of slavery. Buying people out of slavery is like paying a burglar to get your television back  it's abetting a crime. Liberation  however  costs some money. Liberation  and more importantly all the work that comes after liberation. It's not an event  it's a process. It's about helping people to build lives of dignity  stability  economic autonomy  citizenship. Well  amazingly  in places like India where costs are very low  that family  that three generation family that you see there who were in hereditary slavery    so  that granddad there  was born a baby into slavery    but the total cost  amortized across the rest of the work  was about     dollars to bring that family out of slavery and then take them through a two year process to build a stable life of citizenship and education. A boy in Ghana rescued from fishing slavery  about     dollars. In the United States  North America  much more expensive. Legal costs  medical costs ... we understand that it's expensive here  about        dollars. But most of the people in the world in slavery live in those places where the costs are lowest. And in fact  the global average is about what it is for Ghana. And that means  when you multiply it up  the estimated cost of not just freedom but sustainable freedom for the entire    million people on the planet in slavery is something like   .  billion dollars    what Americans spend on potato chips and pretzels  what Seattle is going to spend on its light rail system  usually the annual expenditure in this country on blue jeans  or in the last holiday period when we bought GameBoys and iPods and other tech gifts for people  we spent   .  billion dollars. Intel's fourth quarter earnings    .  billion. It's not a lot of money at the global level. In fact  it's peanuts. And the great thing about it is that it's not money down a hole  there is a freedom dividend. When you let people out of slavery to work for themselves  are they motivated  They take their kids out of the workplace  they build a school  they say   We're going to have stuff we've never had before like three squares  medicine when we're sick  clothing when we're cold.  They become consumers and producers and local economies begin to spiral up very rapidly. That's important  all of that about how we rebuild sustainable freedom  because we'd never want to repeat what happened in this country in     . Four million people were lifted up out of slavery and then dumped. Dumped without political participation  decent education  any kind of real opportunity in terms of economic lives  and then sentenced to generations of violence and prejudice and discrimination. And America is still paying the price for the botched emancipation of     . We have made a commitment that we will never let people come out of slavery on our watch  and end up as second class citizens. It's just not going to happen. This is what liberation really looks like. Children rescued from slavery in the fishing industry in Ghana  reunited with their parents  and then taken with their parents back to their villages to rebuild their economic well being so that they become slave proof    absolutely unenslaveable. Now  this woman lived in a village in Nepal. We'd been working there about a month. They had just begun to come out of a hereditary kind of slavery. They'd just begun to light up a little bit  open up a little bit. But when we went to speak with her  when we took this photograph  the slaveholders were still menacing us from the sidelines. They hadn't been really pushed back. I was frightened. We were frightened. We said to her   Are you worried  Are you upset   She said   No  because we've got hope now. How could we not succeed   she said   when people like you from the other side of the world are coming here to stand beside us   Okay  we have to ask ourselves  are we willing to live in a world with slavery  If we don't take action  we just leave ourselves open to have someone else jerk the strings that tie us to slavery in the products we buy  and in our government policies. And yet  if there's one thing that every human being can agree on  I think it's that slavery should end. And if there is a fundamental violation of our human dignity that we would all say is horrific  it's slavery. And we've got to say  what good is all of our intellectual and political and economic power    and I'm really thinking intellectual power in this room    if we can't use it to bring slavery to an end  I think there is enough intellectual power in this room to bring slavery to an end. And you know what  If we can't do that  if we can't use our intellectual power to end slavery  there is one last question  Are we truly free  Okay  thank you so much. I'm standing in front of you today in all humility  wanting to share with you my journey of the last six years in the field of service and education. And I'm not a trained academic. Neither am I a veteran social worker. I was    years in the corporate world  trying to make organizations profitable. And then in      I started Parikrma Humanity Foundation from my kitchen table. The first thing that we did was walk through the slums. You know  by the way  there are two million people in Bangalore  who live in     slums. We couldn't go to all the slums  but we tried to cover as much as we could. We walked through these slums  identified houses where children would never go to school. We talked to the parents  tried to convince them about sending their children to school. We played with the children  and came back home really tired  exhausted  but with images of bright faces  twinkling eyes  and went to sleep. We were all excited to start  but the numbers hit us then      million children between four to    that should be going to school  but do not      million children who go to school but cannot read      million who cannot do basic maths. We also heard that     billion Indian rupees was dedicated for government schooling. Ninety percent of it was spent on teachers' salary and administrators' salary. And yet  India has nearly the highest teacher absenteeism in the world  with one out of four teachers not going to school at all the entire academic year. Those numbers were absolutely mind boggling  overwhelming  and we were constantly asked   When will you start  How many schools will you start  How many children will you get  How are you going to scale  How are you going to replicate   It was very difficult not to get scared  not to get daunted. But we dug our heels and said   We're not in the number game. We want to take one child at a time and take the child right through school  sent to college  and get them prepared for better living  a high value job.  So  we started Parikrma. The first Parikrma school started in a slum where there were        people living below the poverty line. Our first school was on a rooftop of a building inside the slums  a second story building  the only second story building inside the slums. And that rooftop did not have any ceiling  only half a tin sheet. That was our first school. One hundred sixty five children. Indian academic year begins in June. So  June it rains  so many a times all of us would be huddled under the tin roof  waiting for the rain to stop. My God  What a bonding exercise that was. And all of us that were under that roof are still here together today. Then came the second school  the third school  the fourth school and a junior college. In six years now  we have four schools  one junior college        children coming from    slums and four orphanages. Our dream is very simple  to send each of these kids  get them prepared to be educated but also to live peacefully  contented in this conflict ridden chaotic globalized world. Now  when you talk global you have to talk English. And so all our schools are English medium schools. But they know there is this myth that children from the slums cannot speak English well. No one in their family has spoken English. No one in their generation has spoken English. But how wrong it is. Girl  I like adventurous books  and some of my favorites are Alfred Hitchcock and  unclear  and Hardy Boys. Although they are like in different contexts  one is magical  the other two are like investigation  I like those books because they have something special in them. The vocabulary used in those books and the style of writing. I mean like once I pick up one book I cannot put it down until I finish the whole book. Even if it takes me four and a half hours  or three and half hours to finish my book  I do it. Boy  I did good research and I got the information  on the  world's fastest cars. I like Ducati ZZ     because it is the fastest  the world's fastest bike  and I like Pulsar     DTSI because it is India's fastest bike.  Laughter  Shukla Bose  Well  that girl that you saw  her father sells flowers on the roadside. And this little boy has been coming to school for five years. But isn't it strange that little boys all over the world love fast bikes   Laughter  He hasn't seen one  he hasn't ridden one  of course  but he has done a lot of research through Google search. You know  when we started with our English medium schools we also decided to adopt the best curriculum possible  the ICSE curriculum. And again  there were people who laughed at me and said   Don't be crazy choosing such a tough curriculum for these students. They'll never be able to cope.  Not only do our children cope very well  but they excel in it. You should just come across to see how well our children do. There is also this myth that parents from the slums are not interested in their children going to school  they'd much rather put them to work. That's absolute hogwash. All parents all over the world want their children to lead a better life than themselves  but they need to believe that change is possible. Video   Hindi  SB  We have    percent attendance for all our parents teachers meeting. Sometimes it's even     percent  much more than many privileged schools. Fathers have started to attend. It's very interesting. When we started our school the parents would give thumbprints in the attendance register. Now they have started writing their signature. The children have taught them. It's amazing how much children can teach. We have  a few months ago  actually late last year  we had a few mothers who came to us and said   You know  we want to learn how to read and write. Can you teach us   So  we started an afterschool for our parents  for our mothers. We had    mothers who came regularly after school to study. We want to continue with this program and extend it to all our other schools. Ninety eight percent of our fathers are alcoholics. So  you can imagine how traumatized and how dysfunctional the houses are where our children come from. We have to send the fathers to de addiction labs and when they come back  most times sober  we have to find a job for them so that they don't regress. We have about three fathers who have been trained to cook. We have taught them nutrition  hygiene. We have helped them set up the kitchen and now they are supplying food to all our children. They do a very good job because their children are eating their food  but most importantly this is the first time they have got respect  and they feel that they are doing something worthwhile. More than    percent of our non teaching staff are all parents and extended families. We've started many programs just to make sure that the child comes to school. Vocational skill program for the older siblings so the younger ones are not stopped from coming to school. There is also this myth that children from the slums cannot integrate with mainstream. Take a look at this little girl who was one of the    children from all privileged schools  best schools in the country that was selected for the Duke University talent identification program and was sent to IIM Ahmedabad. Video  Girl  Duke IIMA Camp. Whenever we see that IIMA  it was such a pride for us to go to that camp. Everybody was very friendly  especially I got a lot of friends. And I felt that my English has improved a lot going there and chatting with friends. There they met children who are with a different standard and a different mindset  a totally different society. I mingled with almost everyone. They were very friendly. I had very good friends there  who are from Delhi  who are from Mumbai. Even now we are in touch through Facebook. After this Ahmedabad trip I've been like a totally different mingling with people and all of those. Before that I feel like I wasn't like this. I don't even mingle  or start speaking with someone so quickly. My accent with English improved a lot. And I learned football  volleyball  Frisbee  lots of games. And I wouldn't want to go to Bangalore. Let me stay here. Such beautiful food  I enjoyed it. It was so beautiful. I enjoyed eating food like  unclear  would come and ask me   Yes ma'am  what you want   It was so good to hear  SB  This girl was working as a maid before she came to school. And today she wants to be a neurologist. Our children are doing brilliantly in sports. They are really excelling. There is an inter school athletic competition that is held every year in Bangalore  where       children participate from     best schools in the city. We've got the best school award for three years successively. And our children are coming back home with bags full of medals  with lots of admirers and friends. Last year there were a couple of kids from elite schools that came to ask for admissions in our school. We also have our very own dream team. Why is this happening  Why this confidence  Is it the exposure  We have professors from MIT  Berkeley  Stanford  Indian Institute of Science who come and teach our children lots of scientific formulas  experiments  much beyond the classroom. Art  music are considered therapy and mediums of expression. We also believe that it's the content that is more important. It is not the infrastructure  not the toilets  not the libraries  but it is what actually happens in this school that is more important. Creating an environment of learning  of inquiry  of exploration is what is true education. When we started Parikrma we had no idea which direction we were taking. We didn't hire McKinsey to do a business plan. But we know for sure that what we want to do today is take one child at a time  not get bogged with numbers  and actually see the child complete the circle of life  and unleash his total potential. We do not believe in scale because we believe in quality  and scale and numbers will automatically happen. We have corporates that have stood behind us  and we are able to  now  open more schools. But we began with the idea of one child at a time. This is five year old Parusharam. He was begging by a bus stop a few years ago  got picked up and is now in an orphanage  has been coming to school for the last four and a half months. He's in kindergarten. He has learned how to speak English. We have a model by which kids can speak English and understand English in three month's time. He can tell you stories in English of the thirsty crow  of the crocodile and of the giraffe. And if you ask him what he likes to do he will say   I like sleeping. I like eating. I like playing.  And if you ask him what he wants to do  he will say   I want to horsing.  Now   horsing  is going for a horse ride. So  Parusharam comes to my office every day. He comes for a tummy rub  because he believes that will give me luck.  Laughter  When I started Parikrma I began with a great deal of arrogance of transforming the world. But today I have been transformed. I have been changed with my children. I've learned so much from them  love  compassion  imagination and such creativity. Parusharam is Parikrma with a simple beginning but a long way to go. I promise you  Parusharam will speak in the TED conference a few years from now. Thank you. We are drowning in news. Reuters alone puts out three and a half million news stories a year. That's just one source. My question is  How many of those stories are actually going to matter in the long run  That's the idea behind The Long News. It's a project by The Long Now Foundation  which was founded by TEDsters including Kevin Kelly and Stewart Brand. And what we're looking for is news stories that might still matter    or     or        years from now. And when you look at the news through that filter  a lot falls by the wayside. To take the top stories from the A.P. this last year  is this going to matter in a decade  Or this  Or this  Really  Is this going to matter in    or     years  Okay  that was kind of cool. But the top story of this past year was the economy  and I'm just betting that  sooner or later  this particular recession is going to be old news. So  what kind of stories might make a difference for the future  Well  let's take science. Someday  little robots will go through our bloodstreams fixing things. That someday is already here if you're a mouse. Some recent stories  nanobees zap tumors with real bee venom  they're sending genes into the brain  a robot they built that can crawl through the human body. What about resources  How are we going to feed nine billion people  We're having trouble feeding six billion today. As we heard yesterday  there's over a billion people hungry. Britain will starve without genetically modified crops. Bill Gates  fortunately  has bet a billion on  agricultural  research. What about global politics  The world's going to be very different when and if China sets the agenda  and they may. They've overtaken the U.S. as the world's biggest car market  they've overtaken Germany as the largest exporter  and they've started doing DNA tests on kids to choose their careers. We're finding all kinds of ways to push back the limits of what we know. Some recent discoveries  There's an ant colony from Argentina that has now spread to every continent but Antarctica  there's a self directed robot scientist that's made a discovery    soon  science may no longer need us  and life may no longer need us either  a microbe wakes up after         years. It seems that with or without us  life will go on. But my pick for the top Long News story of this past year was this one  water found on the moon. Makes it a lot easier to put a colony up there. And if NASA doesn't do it  China might  or somebody in this room might write a big check. My point is this  In the long run  some news stories are more important than others. Ladies and gentlemen  at TED we talk a lot about leadership and how to make a movement. So let's watch a movement happen  start to finish  in under three minutes and dissect some lessons from it. First  of course you know  a leader needs the guts to stand out and be ridiculed. What he's doing is so easy to follow. Here's his first follower with a crucial role  he's going to show everyone else how to follow. Now  notice that the leader embraces him as an equal. Now it's not about the leader anymore  it's about them  plural. Now  there he is calling to his friends. Now  if you notice that the first follower is actually an underestimated form of leadership in itself. It takes guts to stand out like that. The first follower is what transforms a lone nut into a leader. And here comes a second follower. Now it's not a lone nut  it's not two nuts    three is a crowd  and a crowd is news. So a movement must be public. It's important to show not just the leader  but the followers  because you find that new followers emulate the followers  not the leader. Now  here come two more people  and immediately after  three more people. Now we've got momentum. This is the tipping point. Now we've got a movement. So  notice that  as more people join in  it's less risky. So those that were sitting on the fence before now have no reason not to. They won't stand out  they won't be ridiculed  but they will be part of the in crowd if they hurry. So  over the next minute  you'll see all of those that prefer to stick with the crowd because eventually they would be ridiculed for not joining in. And that's how you make a movement. But let's recap some lessons from this. So first  if you are the type  like the shirtless dancing guy that is standing alone  remember the importance of nurturing your first few followers as equals so it's clearly about the movement  not you. Okay  but we might have missed the real lesson here. The biggest lesson  if you noticed    did you catch it     is that leadership is over glorified. Yes  it was the shirtless guy who was first  and he'll get all the credit  but it was really the first follower that transformed the lone nut into a leader. So  as we're told that we should all be leaders  that would be really ineffective. If you really care about starting a movement  have the courage to follow and show others how to follow. And when you find a lone nut doing something great  have the guts to be the first one to stand up and join in. And what a perfect place to do that  at TED. Thanks. Now  I want to start with a question  When was the last time you were called  childish   For kids like me  being called childish can be a frequent occurrence. Every time we make irrational demands  exhibit irresponsible behavior  or display any other signs of being normal American citizens  we are called childish. Which really bothers me. After all  take a look at these events  Imperialism and colonization  world wars  George W. Bush. Ask yourself  who's responsible  Adults. Now  what have kids done  Well  Anne Frank touched millions with her powerful account of the Holocaust. Ruby Bridges helped to end segregation in the United States. And  most recently  Charlie Simpson helped to raise         pounds for Haiti  on his little bike. So as you can see evidenced by such examples  age has absolutely nothing to do with it. The traits the word  childish  addresses are seen so often in adults  that we should abolish this age discriminatory word  when it comes to criticizing behavior associated with irresponsibility and irrational thinking. Thank you. Then again  who's to say that certain types of irrational thinking aren't exactly what the world needs  Maybe you've had grand plans before  but stopped yourself  thinking   That's impossible   or  That costs too much   or  That won't benefit me.  For better or worse  we kids aren't hampered as much when it comes to thinking about reasons why not to do things. Kids can be full of inspiring aspirations and hopeful thinking  like my wish that no one went hungry  or that everything were free  a kind of utopia. How many of you still dream like that  and believe in the possibilities  Sometimes a knowledge of history and the past failures of Utopian ideals can be a burden  because you know that if everything were free  then the food stocks would become depleted and scarce and lead to chaos. On the other hand  we kids still dream about perfection. And that's a good thing  because in order to make anything a reality  you have to dream about it first. In many ways  our audacity to imagine helps push the boundaries of possibility. For instance  the Museum of Glass in Tacoma  Washington  my home state    yoohoo  Washington  has a program called Kids Design Glass  and kids draw their own ideas for glass art. The resident artist said they got some of their best ideas from the program  because kids don't think about the limitations of how hard it can be to blow glass into certain shapes  they just think of good ideas. Now  when you think of glass  you might think of colorful Chihuly designs  or maybe Italian vases  but kids challenge glass artists to go beyond that  into the realm of brokenhearted snakes and bacon boys  who you can see has meat vision. Now  our inherent wisdom doesn't have to be insider's knowledge. Kids already do a lot of learning from adults  and we have a lot to share. I think that adults should start learning from kids. Now  I do most of my speaking in front of an education crowd    teachers and students  and I like this analogy  It shouldn't be a teacher at the head of the class  telling students   Do this  do that.  The students should teach their teachers. Learning between grown ups and kids should be reciprocal. The reality  unfortunately  is a little different  and it has a lot to do with trust  or a lack of it. Now  if you don't trust someone  you place restrictions on them  right  If I doubt my older sister's ability to pay back the    percent interest I established on her last loan  I'm going to withhold her ability to get more money from me  until she pays it back. True story  by the way. Now  adults seem to have a prevalently restrictive attitude towards kids  from every  Don't do that  don't do this  in the school handbook  to restrictions on school Internet use. As history points out  regimes become oppressive when they're fearful about keeping control. And although adults may not be quite at the level of totalitarian regimes  kids have no or very little say in making the rules  when really  the attitude should be reciprocal  meaning that the adult population should learn and take into account the wishes of the younger population. Now  what's even worse than restriction  is that adults often underestimate kids' abilities. We love challenges  but when expectations are low  trust me  we will sink to them. My own parents had anything but low expectations for me and my sister. Okay  so they didn't tell us to become doctors or lawyers or anything like that  but my dad did read to us about Aristotle and pioneer germ fighters  when lots of other kids were hearing  The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round.  Well  we heard that one too  but  Pioneer Germ Fighters  totally rules. I loved to write from the age of four  and when I was six  my mom bought me my own laptop equipped with Microsoft Word. Thank you  Bill Gates  and thank you  Ma. I wrote over     short stories on that little laptop  and I wanted to get published. Instead of just scoffing at this heresy that a kid wanted to get published  or saying wait until you're older  my parents were really supportive. Many publishers were not quite so encouraging. One large children's publisher ironically said that they didn't work with children. Children's publisher not working with children  I don't know  you're kind of alienating a large client there. One publisher  Action Publishing  was willing to take that leap and trust me  and to listen to what I had to say. They published my first book   Flying Fingers   you see it here. And from there on  it's gone to speaking at hundreds of schools  keynoting to thousands of educators  and finally  today  speaking to you. I appreciate your attention today  because to show that you truly care  you listen. But there's a problem with this rosy picture of kids being so much better than adults. Kids grow up and become adults just like you. Or just like you  Really  The goal is not to turn kids into your kind of adult  but rather  better adults than you have been  which may be a little challenging  considering your guys' credentials. But the way progress happens  is because new generations and new eras grow and develop and become better than the previous ones. It's the reason we're not in the Dark Ages anymore. No matter your position or place in life  it is imperative to create opportunities for children  so that we can grow up to blow you away. Adults and fellow TEDsters  you need to listen and learn from kids  and trust us and expect more from us. You must lend an ear today  because we are the leaders of tomorrow  which means we're going to take care of you when you're old and senile. No  just kidding. No  really  we are going to be the next generation  the ones who will bring this world forward. And in case you don't think that this really has meaning for you  remember that cloning is possible  and that involves going through childhood again  in which case you'll want to be heard  just like my generation. Now  the world needs opportunities for new leaders and new ideas. Kids need opportunities to lead and succeed. Are you ready to make the match  Because the world's problems shouldn't be the human family's heirloom. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  People do stupid things. That's what spreads HIV.  This was a headline in a U.K. newspaper  The Guardian  not that long ago. I'm curious  show of hands  who agrees with it  Well  one or two brave souls. This is actually a direct quote from an epidemiologist who's been in field of HIV for    years  worked on four continents  and you're looking at her. And I am now going to argue that this is only half true. People do get HIV because they do stupid things  but most of them are doing stupid things for perfectly rational reasons. Now   rational  is the dominant paradigm in public health  and if you put your public health nerd glasses on  you'll see that if we give people the information that they need about what's good for them and what's bad for them  if you give them the services that they can use to act on that information  and a little bit of motivation  people will make rational decisions and live long and healthy lives. Wonderful. That's slightly problematic for me because I work in HIV  and although I'm sure you all know that HIV is about poverty and gender inequality  and if you were at TED '   it's about coffee prices ... Actually  HIV's about sex and drugs  and if there are two things that make human beings a little bit irrational  they are erections and addiction. So  let's start with what's rational for an addict. Now  I remember speaking to an Indonesian friend of mine  Frankie. We were having lunch and he was telling me about when he was in jail in Bali for a drug injection. It was someone's birthday  and they had very kindly smuggled some heroin into jail  and he was very generously sharing it out with all of his colleagues. And so everyone lined up  all the smackheads in a row  and the guy whose birthday it was filled up the fit  and he went down and started injecting people. So he injects the first guy  and then he's wiping the needle on his shirt  and he injects the next guy. And Frankie says   I'm number    in line  and I can see the needle coming down towards me  and there is blood all over the place. It's getting blunter and blunter. And a small part of my brain is thinking  'That is so gross and really dangerous ' but most of my brain is thinking  'Please let there be some smack left by the time it gets to me. Please let there be some left.'  And then  telling me this story  Frankie said   You know ... God  drugs really make you stupid.  And  you know  you can't fault him for accuracy. But  actually  Frankie  at that time  was a heroin addict and he was in jail. So his choice was either to accept that dirty needle or not to get high. And if there's one place you really want to get high  it's when you're in jail. But I'm a scientist and I don't like to make data out of anecdotes  so let's look at some data. We talked to     drug addicts in three cities in Indonesia  and we said   Well  do you know how you get HIV    Oh yeah  by sharing needles.  I mean  nearly     percent. Yeah  by sharing needles. And   Do you know where you can get a clean needle at a price you can afford to avoid that    Oh yeah.  Hundred percent.  We're smackheads  we know where to get clean needles.   So are you carrying a needle   We're actually interviewing people on the street  in the places where they're hanging out and taking drugs.  Are you carrying clean needles   One in four  maximum. So no surprises then that the proportion that actually used clean needles every time they injected in the last week is just about one in     and the other nine in    are sharing. So you've got this massive mismatch  everyone knows that if they share they're going to get HIV  but they're all sharing anyway. So what's that about  Is it like you get a better high if you share or something  We asked that to a junkie and they're like   Are you nuts   You don't want to share a needle anymore than you want to share a toothbrush even with someone you're sleeping with. There's just kind of an ick factor there.  No  no. We share needles because we don't want to go to jail.  So  in Indonesia at this time  if you were carrying a needle and the cops rounded you up  they could put you into jail. And that changes the equation slightly  doesn't it  Because your choice now is either I use my own needle now  or I could share a needle now and get a disease that's going to possibly kill me    years from now  or I could use my own needle now and go to jail tomorrow. And while junkies think that it's a really bad idea to expose themselves to HIV  they think it's a much worse idea to spend the next year in jail where they'll probably end up in Frankie's situation and expose themselves to HIV anyway. So  suddenly it becomes perfectly rational to share needles. Now  let's look at it from a policy maker's point of view. This is a really easy problem. For once  your incentives are aligned. We've got what's rational for public health. You want people to use clean needles    and junkies want to use clean needles. So we could make this problem go away simply by making clean needles universally available and taking away the fear of arrest. Now  the first person to figure that out and do something about it on a national scale was that well known  bleeding heart liberal Margaret Thatcher. And she put in the world's first national needle exchange program  and other countries followed suit  Australia  The Netherlands and few others. And in all of those countries  you can see  not more than four percent of injectors ever became infected with HIV. Now  places that didn't do this    New York City for example  Moscow  Jakarta    we're talking  at its peak  one in two injectors infected with this fatal disease. Now  Margaret Thatcher didn't do this because she has any great love for junkies. She did it because she ran a country that had a national health service. So  if she didn't invest in effective prevention  she was going to have pick up the costs of treatment later on  and obviously those are much higher. So she was making a politically rational decision. Now  if I take out my public health nerd glasses here and look at these data  it seems like a no brainer  doesn't it  But in this country  where the government apparently does not feel compelled to provide health care for citizens   Laughter  we've taken a very different approach. So what we've been doing in the United States is reviewing the data    endlessly reviewing the data. So  these are reviews of hundreds of studies by all the big muckety mucks of the scientific pantheon in the United States  and these are the studies that show needle programs are effective    quite a lot of them. Now  the ones that show that needle programs aren't effective    you think that's one of these annoying dynamic slides and I'm going to press my dongle and the rest of it's going to come up  but no    that's the whole slide. There is nothing on the other side. So  completely irrational  you would think. Except that  wait a minute  politicians are rational  too  and they're responding to what they think the voters want. So what we see is that voters respond very well to things like this and not quite so well to things like this. So it becomes quite rational to deny services to injectors. Now let's talk about sex. Are we any more rational about sex  Well  I'm not even going to address the clearly irrational positions of people like the Catholic Church  who think somehow that if you give out condoms  everyone's going to run out and have sex. I don't know if Pope Benedict watches TEDTalks online  but if you do  I've got news for you Benedict    I carry condoms all the time and I never get laid. It's not that easy  Here  maybe you'll have better luck. Okay  seriously  HIV is actually not that easy to transmit sexually. So  it depends on how much virus there is in your blood and in your body fluids. And what we've got is a very  very high level of virus right at the beginning when you're first infected  then you start making antibodies  and then it bumps along at quite low levels for a long time       or    years    you have spikes if you get another sexually transmitted infection. But basically  nothing much is going on until you start to get symptomatic AIDS  and by that stage  you're not looking great  you're not feeling great  you're not having that much sex. So the sexual transmission of HIV is essentially determined by how many partners you have in these very short spaces of time when you have peak viremia. Now  this makes people crazy because it means that you have to talk about some groups having more sexual partners in shorter spaces of time than other groups  and that's considered stigmatizing. I've always been a bit curious about that because I think stigma is a bad thing  whereas lots of sex is quite a good thing  but we'll leave that be. The truth is that    years of very good research have shown us that there are groups that are more likely to turnover large numbers of partners in a short space of time. And those groups are  globally  people who sell sex and their more regular partners. They are gay men on the party scene who have  on average  three times more partners than straight people on the party scene. And they are heterosexuals who come from countries that have traditions of polygamy and relatively high levels of female autonomy  and almost all of those countries are in east or southern Africa. And that is reflected in the epidemic that we have today. You can see these horrifying figures from Africa. These are all countries in southern Africa where between one in seven  and one in three of all adults  are infected with HIV. Now  in the rest of the world  we've got basically nothing going on in the general population    very  very low levels    but we have extraordinarily high levels of HIV in these other populations who are at highest risk  drug injectors  sex workers and gay men. And you'll note  that's the local data from Los Angeles     percent prevalence among gay men. Of course  you can't get HIV just by having unprotected sex. You can only HIV by having unprotected sex with a positive person. In most of the world  these few prevention failures notwithstanding  we are actually doing quite well these days in commercial sex  condom use rates are between    and     percent in commercial sex in most countries. And  again  it's because of an alignment of the incentives. What's rational for public health is also rational for individual sex workers because it's really bad for business to have another STI. No one wants it. And  actually  clients don't want to go home with a drip either. So essentially  you're able to achieve quite high rates of condom use in commercial sex. But in  intimate  relations it's much more difficult because  with your wife or your boyfriend or someone that you hope might turn into one of those things  we have this illusion of romance and trust and intimacy  and nothing is quite so unromantic as the   My condom or yours  darling   question. So in the face of that  you really need quite a strong incentive to use condoms. This  for example  this gentleman is called Joseph. He's from Haiti and he has AIDS. And he's probably not having a lot of sex right now  but he is a reminder in the population  of why you might want to be using condoms. This is also in Haiti and is a reminder of why you might want to be having sex  perhaps. Now  funnily enough  this is also Joseph after six months on antiretroviral treatment. Not for nothing do we call it the Lazarus Effect. But it is changing the equation of what's rational in sexual decision making. So  what we've got    some people say   Oh  it doesn't matter very much because  actually  treatment is effective prevention because it lowers your viral load and therefore makes it more difficult to transmit HIV.  So  if you look at the viremia thing again  if you do start treatment when you're sick  well  what happens  Your viral load comes down. But compared to what  What happens if you're not on treatment  Well  you die  so your viral load goes to zero. And all of this green stuff here  including the spikes    which are because you couldn't get to the pharmacy  or you ran out of drugs  or you went on a three day party binge and forgot to take your drugs  or because you've started to get resistance  or whatever    all of that is virus that wouldn't be out there  except for treatment. Now  am I saying   Oh  well  great prevention strategy. Let's just stop treating people.  Of course not  of course not. We need to expand antiretroviral treatment as much as we can. But what I am doing is calling into question those people who say that more treatment is all the prevention we need. That's simply not necessarily true  and I think we can learn a lot from the experience of gay men in rich countries where treatment has been widely available for going on    years now. And what we've seen is that  actually  condom use rates  which were very  very high    the gay community responded very rapidly to HIV  with extremely little help from public health nerds  I would say    that condom use rate has come down dramatically since treatment for two reasons really  One is the assumption of   Oh well  if he's infected  he's probably on meds  and his viral load's going to be low  so I'm pretty safe.  And the other thing is that people are simply not as scared of HIV as they were of AIDS  and rightly so. AIDS was a disfiguring disease that killed you  and HIV is an invisible virus that makes you take a pill every day. And that's boring  but is it as boring as having to use a condom every time you have sex  no matter how drunk you are  no matter how many poppers you've taken  whatever  If we look at the data  we can see that the answer to that question is  mmm. So these are data from Scotland. You see the peak in drug injectors before they started the national needle exchange program. Then it came way down. And both in heterosexuals    mostly in commercial sex    and in drug users  you've really got nothing much going on after treatment begins  and that's because of that alignment of incentives that I talked about earlier. But in gay men  you've got quite a dramatic rise starting three or four years after treatment became widely available. This is of new infections. What does that mean  It means that the combined effect of being less worried and having more virus out there in the population    more people living longer  healthier lives  more likely to be getting laid with HIV    is outweighing the effects of lower viral load  and that's a very worrisome thing. What does it mean  It means we need to be doing more prevention the more treatment we have. Is that what's happening  No  and I call it the  compassion conundrum.  We've talked a lot about compassion the last couple of days  and what's happening really is that people are unable quite to bring themselves to put in good sexual and reproductive health services for sex workers  unable quite to be giving out needles to junkies. But once they've gone from being transgressive people whose behaviors we don't want to condone to being AIDS victims  we come over all compassionate and buy them incredibly expensive drugs for the rest of their lives. It doesn't make any sense from a public health point of view. I want to give what's very nearly the last word to Ines. Ines is a a transgender hooker on the streets of Jakarta  she's a chick with a dick. Why does she do that job  Well  of course  because she's forced into it because she doesn't have any better option  etc.  etc. And if we could just teach her to sew and get her a nice job in a factory  all would be well. This is what factory workers earn in an hour in Indonesia  on average     cents. It varies a bit province to province. I do speak to sex workers         of them for this particular slide  and this is what sex workers say they earn in an hour. So it's not a great job  but for a lot of people it really is quite a rational choice. Okay  Ines. We've got the tools  the knowledge and the cash  and commitment to preventing HIV too. Ines  So why is prevalence still rising  It's all politics. When you get to politics  nothing makes sense. Elizabeth Pisani   When you get to politics  nothing makes sense.  So  from the point of view of a sex worker  politicians are making no sense. From the point of view of a public health nerd  junkies are doing dumb things. The truth is that everyone has a different rationale. There are as many different ways of being rational as there are human beings on the planet  and that's one of the glories of human existence. But those ways of being rational are not independent of one another  so it's rational for a drug injector to share needles because of a stupid decision that's made by a politician  and it's rational for a politician to make that stupid decision because they're responding to what they think the voters want. But here's the thing  we are the voters. We're not all of them  of course  but TED is a community of opinion leaders. And everyone who's in this room  and everyone who's watching this out there on the web  I think  has a duty to demand of their politicians that we make policy based on scientific evidence and on common sense. It's going to be really hard for us to individually affect what's rational for every Frankie and every Ines out there  but you can at least use your vote to stop politicians doing stupid things that spread HIV. Thank you. It's not about technology  it's about people and stories. I could show you what recently was on television as a high quality video     Minutes  many of you may have seen it. And it was the now director of the entire piece of the veteran's administration    who  himself  had lost an arm    years ago in Vietnam    who was adamantly opposed to these crazy devices that don't work. And it turns out that with    Minutes cameras rolling in the background  after he pretty much made his position clear on this    he had his hook and he had his    he wore this arm for less than two hours and was able to pour himself a drink and got quite emotional over the fact that  quote    his quote    it's the first time he's felt like he's had an arm in    years. But that would sort of be jumping to the middle of the story  and I'm not going to show you that polished video. I'm going to  instead  in a minute or two  show you an early  crude video because I think it's a better way to tell a story. A few years ago I was visited by the guy that runs DARPA  the people that fund all the advanced technologies that businesses and universities probably wouldn't take the risk of doing. They have a particular interest in ones that will help our soldiers. I get this sort of unrequested    by me anyway    visit  and sitting in my conference room is a very senior surgeon from the military and the guy that runs DARPA. They proceed to tell me a story which comes down to basically the following. We have used such advanced technologies now and made them available in the most remote places that we put soldiers  hills of Afghanistan  Iraq ... They were quite proud of the fact that you know  before the dust clears  if some soldier has been hurt they will have collected him or her  they will have brought him back  they will be getting world class triage emergency care faster than you and I would be getting it if we were hurt in a car accident in a major city in the United States. That's the good news. The bad news is if they've collected this person and he or she is missing an arm or leg  part of the face  it's probably not coming back. So  they started giving me the statistics on how many of these kids had lost an arm. And then the surgeon pointed out  with a lot of anger  he said   Why is it  At the end of the Civil War  they were shooting each other with muskets. If somebody lost an arm  we gave them a wooden stick with a hook on it. Now we've got F  s and F  s  and if somebody loses an arm  we give them a plastic stick with a hook on it.  And they basically said   This is unacceptable   and then the punchline   So  Dean  we're here because you make medical stuff. You're going to give us an arm.  And I was waiting for the     pages of bureaucracy  paperwork and DODs. No  the guy says   We're going to bring a guy into this conference room  and wearing the arm you're going to give us  he or she is going to pick up a raisin or a grape off this table. If it's the grape  they won't break it.  Great he needs efferent  afferent  haptic response sensors.  If it's the raisin  they won't drop it.  So he wants fine motor control  flex at the wrist  flex at the elbow  abduct and flex at the shoulder. Either way they were going to eat it.  Oh  by the way Dean. It's going to fit on a   th percentile female frame    namely    inches from the long finger    and weigh less than nine pounds.    th percentile female frame.  And it's going to be completely self contained including all its power.  So  they finished that. And I  as you can tell  am a bashful guy. I told them they're nuts. They've been watching too much  Terminator.  Then  the surgeon says to me   Dean  you need to know more than two dozen of these kids have come back bilateral.  Now  I cannot imagine    I'm sorry  you may have a better imagination than I do    I can't imagine losing my arm  and typically at    years old. But compared to that  losing two  Seems like that would be an inconvenience. Anyway  I went home that night. I thought about it. I literally could not sleep thinking about   I wonder how you'd roll over with no shoulders.  So  I decided we've got to do this. And trust me  I've got a day job  I've got a lot of day jobs. Most of my day job keeps me busy funding my fantasies like FIRST and water and power .... And I've got a lot of day jobs. But I figured I gotta do this. Did a little investigation  went down to Washington  told them I still think they're nuts but we're going to do it. And I told them I'd build them an arm. I told them it would probably take five years to get through the FDA  and probably    years to be reasonably functional. Look what it takes to make things like iPods.  Great   he said   You got two years.  I said   I'll tell you what. I'll build you an arm that's under nine pounds that has all that capability in one year. It will take the other nine to make it functional and useful.  We sort of agreed to disagree. I went back and I started putting a team together  the best guys I could find with a passion to do this. At the end of exactly one year we had a device with    degrees of freedom  all the sensors  all the microprocessors  all the stuff inside. I could show you it with a cosmesis on it that's so real it's eerie  but then you wouldn't see all this cool stuff. I then thought it would be years before we'd be able to make it really  really useful. It turned out  as I think you could see in Aimee's capabilities and attitudes  people with a desire to do something are quite remarkable and nature is quite adaptable. Anyway  with less than    hours of use  two guys    one that's bilateral. He's literally  he's got no shoulder on one side  and he's high trans humeral on the other. And that's Chuck and Randy together  after    hours    were playing in our office. And we took some pretty cruddy home movies. At the end of the one I'm going to show  it's only about a minute and a couple of seconds long  Chuck does something that to this day I'm jealous of  I can't do it. He picks up a spoon  picks it up  scoops out some Shredded Wheat and milk  holds the spoon level as he translates it  moving all these joints simultaneously  to his mouth  and he doesn't drop any milk. I cannot do that. His wife was standing behind me. She's standing behind me at the time and she says   Dean  Chuck hasn't fed himself in    years. So  you've got a choice  We keep the arm  or you keep Chuck.  So  can we see that  This is Chuck showing simultaneous control of all the joints. He's punching our controls guy. The guy behind him is our engineer surgeon  which is a convenient guy to have around. There's Randy  these guys are passing a rubber little puck between them. And just as in the spirit of FIRST  gracious professionalism  they are quite proud of this  so they decide to share a drink. This is a non trivial thing to do  by the way. Imagine doing that with a wooden stick and a hook on the end of it  doing either of those. Now Chuck is doing something quite extraordinary  at least for my limited physical skill. And now he's going to do what DARPA asked me for. He's going to pick up a grape    he didn't drop it  he didn't break it    and he's going to eat it. So  that's where we were at the end of about    months. But  as I've learned from Richard  the technology  the processors  the sensors  the motors  is not the story. I hadn't dealt with this kind of problem or frankly  this whole segment of the medical world. I'll give you some astounding things that have happened as we started this. After we were pretty much convinced we had a good design  and we'd have to make all the standard engineering trade offs you always make    you can always get three out of four of anything you want  the weight  the size  the cost  the functionality    I put a bunch of guys in my plane and I said   We're flying down to Walter Reed  and we're going talk to these kids  because frankly it doesn't matter whether we like this arm. It doesn't matter whether the Department of Defense likes this arm.  When I told them that they weren't entirely enthusiastic  but I told them   It really doesn't matter what their opinion is. There is only one opinion that matters  the kids that are either going to use it or not.  I told a bunch of my engineers   Look we're going to walk into Walter Reed  and you're going to see people  lots of them  missing major body parts. They're probably going to be angry  depressed  frustrated. We're probably going to have to give them support  encouragement. But we've got to extract from them enough information to make sure we're doing the right thing.  We walked into Walter Reed and I could not have been more wrong. We did see a bunch of people  a lot of them missing a lot of body parts  and parts they had left were burned  half a face gone  an ear burned off. They were sitting at a table. They were brought together for us. And we started asking them all questions.  Look   I'd say to them   We're not quite as good as nature yet. I could give you fine motor control  or I could let you curl    pounds  I probably can't do both. I can give you fast control with low reduction ratios in these gears  or I can give you power  I can't give you both. And we were trying to get them to all help us know what to give them. Not only were they enthusiastic  they kept thinking they're there to help us.  Well  would it help if I ...   Guys  and woman  you've given enough. We're here to help you. We need data. We need to know what you need.  After a half an hour  maybe  there was one guy at the far end of the table who wasn't saying much. You could see he was missing an arm. He was leaning on his other arm. I called down to the end   Hey  you haven't said much. If we needed this or this  what would you want   And he said   You know  I'm the lucky guy at this table. I lost my right arm  but I'm a lefty.  So  he wouldn't say much. He had a great spirit  like all the rest of them had great spirits. And he made a few comments. And then the meeting ended. We said goodbye to all these guys. And that guy pushed himself back from the table ... he has no legs. So  we left. And I was thinking   We didn't give them support and encouragement  they gave it to us. They're not finished giving yet.  It was astounding. So  we went back. And I started working harder  faster. Then we went out to Brooke Army Medical Center. And we saw lots of these kids  lots of them. And it was astounding how positive they are. So  we went back  and we've been working harder yet. We're in clinical trials  we've got five of them on people. We're screaming along. And I get a call and we go back to Washington. We go back to Walter Reed  and a kid  literally     some odd days before that was blown up. And they shipped him to Germany and    hours later they shipped him from Germany to Walter Reed. And he was there  and they said we needed to come. And I went down and they rolled him into a room. He's got no legs. He's got no arms. He's got a small residual limb on one side. Half of his face is gone  but they said his vision is coming back. He had one good eye. His name is Brandon Marrocco. And he said   I need your arms  but I need two of them.   You'll get them.  This kid was from Staten Island. And he said   I had a truck  before I went over there  and it had a stick. You think I'll be able to drive it    Sure.  And I turned around and went   How are we going to do this   Anyway  he was just like all the rest of them. He doesn't really want a lot. He wants to help. He told me that he wanted to go back to help his buddies. So  I was on my way out here. I was asked to stop at Texas. There were       people  the Veteran's Administration  U.S. ... just       at this huge event to help the families of all the kids    some that have died  some that are like Brandon    and they wanted me to speak. I said   What am I going to say  This is not a happy thing. Look  if this happens to you  I can give you ... This stuff is still not as good at the original equipment.   You need to come.  So  I went. And  as I think you get the point  there were a lot people there recovering. Some further along than others. But universally  these people that had been through this had astounding attitudes  and just the fact that people care makes a huge difference to them. I'll shut up  except one message or concern I have. I don't think anybody does it intentionally  but there were people there literally talking about   Well  how much will they get   You know  this country is involved as we've all heard  in this great healthcare debate.  Who is entitled to what  Who is entitled to how much  Who is going to pay for it   Those are tough questions. I don't have an answer to that. Not everybody can be entitled to everything simply because you were born here. It's not possible. It would be nice but let's be realistic. They were tough questions. There's polarized groups down there. I don't know the answers. There are other questions that are tough.  Should we be there  How do we get out  What do we need to do   There's very polarized answers to that question too  and I don't have any answers to that. Those are political questions  economic questions  strategic questions. I don't have the answer. But let me give you a simple concern or maybe statement  then. It is an easy answer. I know what these kids deserve on the healthcare side. I was talking to one of them  and he was really liking this arm    it's way  way  way better than a plastic stick with a hook on it    but there's nobody in this room that would rather have that than the one you got. But I was saying to him   You know  the first airplane went     feet in     . Wilbur and Orville. But you know what  It wouldn't have made an old pigeon jealous. But now we got Eagles out there  F  s  even that Bald Eagle. I've never seen a bird flying around at Mach  . I think eventually we'll make these things extraordinary.  And I said to that kid   I'll stop when your buddies are envious of your Luke arm because of what it can do  and how it does it. And we'll keep working. And I'm not going to stop working until we do that.  And I think this country ought to continue its great debate  whining and complaining   I'm entitled.   You're a victim.  And whining and complaining about what our foreign policy ought to be. But while we have the luxury of whining and complaining about who's paying for what and how much we get  the people that are out there giving us that great privilege of whining and complaining  I know what they deserve  everything humanly possible. And we ought to give it to them. So  the first robot to talk about is called STriDER. It stands for Self excited Tripedal Dynamic Experimental Robot. It's a robot that has three legs  which is inspired by nature. But have you seen anything in nature  an animal that has three legs  Probably not. So  why do I call this a biologically inspired robot  How would it work  But before that  let's look at pop culture. So  you know H.G. Wells'  War of the Worlds   novel and movie. And what you see over here is a very popular video game  and in this fiction they describe these alien creatures that are robots that have three legs that terrorize Earth. But my robot  STriDER  does not move like this. So  this is an actual dynamic simulation animation. I'm just going to show you how the robot works. It flips its body     degrees and it swings its leg between the two legs and catches the fall. So  that's how it walks. But when you look at us human being  bipedal walking  what you're doing is you're not really using a muscle to lift your leg and walk like a robot. Right  What you're doing is you really swing your leg and catch the fall  stand up again  swing your leg and catch the fall. You're using your built in dynamics  the physics of your body  just like a pendulum. We call that the concept of passive dynamic locomotion. What you're doing is  when you stand up  potential energy to kinetic energy  potential energy to kinetic energy. It's a constantly falling process. So  even though there is nothing in nature that looks like this  really  we were inspired by biology and applying the principles of walking to this robot. Thus it's a biologically inspired robot. What you see over here  this is what we want to do next. We want to fold up the legs and shoot it up for long range motion. And it deploys legs    it looks almost like  Star Wars     when it lands  it absorbs the shock and starts walking. What you see over here  this yellow thing  this is not a death ray.  Laughter  This is just to show you that if you have cameras or different types of sensors    because it is tall  it's  .  meters tall    you can see over obstacles like bushes and those kinds of things. So we have two prototypes. The first version  in the back  that's STriDER I. The one in front  the smaller  is STriDER II. The problem that we had with STriDER I is it was just too heavy in the body. We had so many motors  you know  aligning the joints  and those kinds of things. So  we decided to synthesize a mechanical mechanism so we could get rid of all the motors  and with a single motor we can coordinate all the motions. It's a mechanical solution to a problem  instead of using mechatronics. So  with this now the top body is light enough. So  it's walking in our lab  this was the very first successful step. It's still not perfected    its coffee falls down    so we still have a lot of work to do. The second robot I want to talk about is called IMPASS. It stands for Intelligent Mobility Platform with Actuated Spoke System. So  it's a wheel leg hybrid robot. So  think of a rimless wheel or a spoke wheel  but the spokes individually move in and out of the hub  so  it's a wheel leg hybrid. We are literally re inventing the wheel here. Let me demonstrate how it works. So  in this video we're using an approach called the reactive approach. Just simply using the tactile sensors on the feet  it's trying to walk over a changing terrain  a soft terrain where it pushes down and changes. And just by the tactile information  it successfully crosses over these type of terrain. But  when it encounters a very extreme terrain  in this case  this obstacle is more than three times the height of the robot  Then it switches to a deliberate mode  where it uses a laser range finder  and camera systems  to identify the obstacle and the size  and it plans  carefully plans the motion of the spokes and coordinates it so that it can show this kind of very very impressive mobility. You probably haven't seen anything like this out there. This is a very high mobility robot that we developed called IMPASS. Ah  isn't that cool  When you drive your car  when you steer your car  you use a method called Ackermann steering. The front wheels rotate like this. For most small wheeled robots  they use a method called differential steering where the left and right wheel turns the opposite direction. For IMPASS  we can do many  many different types of motion. For example  in this case  even though the left and right wheel is connected with a single axle rotating at the same angle of velocity. We just simply change the length of the spoke. It affects the diameter and then can turn to the left  turn to the right. So  these are just some examples of the neat things that we can do with IMPASS. This robot is called CLIMBeR  Cable suspended Limbed Intelligent Matching Behavior Robot. So  I've been talking to a lot of NASA JPL scientists    at JPL they are famous for the Mars rovers    and the scientists  geologists always tell me that the real interesting science  the science rich sites  are always at the cliffs. But the current rovers cannot get there. So  inspired by that we wanted to build a robot that can climb a structured cliff environment. So  this is CLIMBeR. So  what it does  it has three legs. It's probably difficult to see  but it has a winch and a cable at the top    and it tries to figure out the best place to put its foot. And then once it figures that out in real time  it calculates the force distribution  how much force it needs to exert to the surface so it doesn't tip and doesn't slip. Once it stabilizes that  it lifts a foot  and then with the winch it can climb up these kinds of thing. Also for search and rescue applications as well. Five years ago I actually worked at NASA JPL during the summer as a faculty fellow. And they already had a six legged robot called LEMUR. So  this is actually based on that. This robot is called MARS  Multi Appendage Robotic System. So  it's a hexapod robot. We developed our adaptive gait planner. We actually have a very interesting payload on there. The students like to have fun. And here you can see that it's walking over unstructured terrain. It's trying to walk on the coarse terrain  sandy area  but depending on the moisture content or the grain size of the sand the foot's soil sinkage model changes. So  it tries to adapt its gait to successfully cross over these kind of things. And also  it does some fun stuff  as can imagine. We get so many visitors visiting our lab. So  when the visitors come  MARS walks up to the computer  starts typing  Hello  my name is MARS.  Welcome to RoMeLa  the Robotics Mechanisms Laboratory at Virginia Tech. This robot is an amoeba robot. Now  we don't have enough time to go into technical details  I'll just show you some of the experiments. So  this is some of the early feasibility experiments. We store potential energy to the elastic skin to make it move. Or use an active tension cords to make it move forward and backward. It's called ChIMERA. We also have been working with some scientists and engineers from UPenn to come up with a chemically actuated version of this amoeba robot. We do something to something And just like magic  it moves. The blob. This robot is a very recent project. It's called RAPHaEL. Robotic Air Powered Hand with Elastic Ligaments. There are a lot of really neat  very good robotic hands out there in the market. The problem is they're just too expensive  tens of thousands of dollars. So  for prosthesis applications it's probably not too practical  because it's not affordable. We wanted to go tackle this problem in a very different direction. Instead of using electrical motors  electromechanical actuators  we're using compressed air. We developed these novel actuators for joints. It is compliant. You can actually change the force  simply just changing the air pressure. And it can actually crush an empty soda can. It can pick up very delicate objects like a raw egg  or in this case  a lightbulb. The best part  it took only      dollars to make the first prototype. This robot is actually a family of snake robots that we call HyDRAS  Hyper Degrees of freedom Robotic Articulated Serpentine. This is a robot that can climb structures. This is a HyDRAS's arm. It's a    degrees of freedom robotic arm. But the cool part is the user interface. The cable over there  that's an optical fiber. And this student  probably the first time using it  but she can articulate it many different ways. So  for example in Iraq  you know  the war zone  there is roadside bombs. Currently you send these remotely controlled vehicles that are armed. It takes really a lot of time and it's expensive to train the operator to operate this complex arm. In this case it's very intuitive  this student  probably his first time using it  doing very complex manipulation tasks  picking up objects and doing manipulation  just like that. Very intuitive. Now  this robot is currently our star robot. We actually have a fan club for the robot  DARwIn  Dynamic Anthropomorphic Robot with Intelligence. As you know  we are very interested in humanoid robot  human walking  so we decided to build a small humanoid robot. This was in       at that time  this was something really  really revolutionary. This was more of a feasibility study  What kind of motors should we use  Is it even possible  What kinds of controls should we do  So  this does not have any sensors. So  it's an open loop control. For those who probably know  if you don't have any sensors and there are any disturbances  you know what happens. So  based on that success  the following year we did the proper mechanical design starting from kinematics. And thus  DARwIn I was born in     . It stands up  it walks    very impressive. However  still  as you can see  it has a cord  umbilical cord. So  we're still using an external power source and external computation. So  in       now it's really time to have fun. Let's give it intelligence. We give it all the computing power it needs  a  .  gigahertz Pentium M chip  two FireWire cameras  rate gyros  accelerometers  four force sensors on the foot  lithium polymer batteries. And now DARwIn II is completely autonomous. It is not remote controlled. There are no tethers. It looks around  searches for the ball  looks around  searches for the ball  and it tries to play a game of soccer  autonomously  artificial intelligence. Let's see how it does. This was our very first trial  and... Spectators  Video   Goal  Dennis Hong  So  there is actually a competition called RoboCup. I don't know how many of you have heard about RoboCup. It's an international autonomous robot soccer competition. And the goal of RoboCup  the actual goal is  by the year      we want to have full size  autonomous humanoid robots play soccer against the human World Cup champions and win. It's a true actual goal. It's a very ambitious goal  but we truly believe that we can do it. So  this is last year in China. We were the very first team in the United States that qualified in the humanoid RoboCup competition. This is this year in Austria. You're going to see the action  three against three  completely autonomous. There you go. Yes  The robots track and they team play amongst themselves. It's very impressive. It's really a research event packaged in a more exciting competition event. What you see over here  this is the beautiful Louis Vuitton Cup trophy. So  this is for the best humanoid  and we would like to bring this for the very first time  to the United States next year  so wish us luck. Thank you. DARwIn also has a lot of other talents. Last year it actually conducted the Roanoke Symphony Orchestra for the holiday concert. This is the next generation robot  DARwIn IV  but smarter  faster  stronger. And it's trying to show off its ability   I'm macho  I'm strong. I can also do some Jackie Chan motion  martial art movements.  And it walks away. So  this is DARwIn IV. And again  you'll be able to see it in the lobby. We truly believe this is going to be the very first running humanoid robot in the United States. So  stay tuned. All right. So I showed you some of our exciting robots at work. So  what is the secret of our success  Where do we come up with these ideas  How do we develop these kinds of ideas  We have a fully autonomous vehicle that can drive into urban environments. We won a half a million dollars in the DARPA Urban Challenge. We also have the world's very first vehicle that can be driven by the blind. We call it the Blind Driver Challenge  very exciting. And many  many other robotics projects I want to talk about. These are just the awards that we won in      fall from robotics competitions and those kinds of things. So  really  we have five secrets. First is  Where do we get inspiration  Where do we get this spark of imagination  This is a true story  my personal story. At night when I go to bed        a.m. in the morning  I lie down  close my eyes  and I see these lines and circles and different shapes floating around. And they assemble  and they form these kinds of mechanisms. And then I think   Ah this is cool.  So  right next to my bed I keep a notebook  a journal  with a special pen that has a light on it  LED light  because I don't want to turn on the light and wake up my wife. So  I see this  scribble everything down  draw things  and I go to bed. Every day in the morning  the first thing I do before my first cup of coffee  before I brush my teeth  I open my notebook. Many times it's empty  sometimes I have something there    if something's there  sometimes it's junk    but most of the time I can't even read my handwriting. And so    am in the morning  what do you expect  right  So  I need to decipher what I wrote. But sometimes I see this ingenious idea in there  and I have this eureka moment. I directly run to my home office  sit at my computer  I type in the ideas  I sketch things out and I keep a database of ideas. So  when we have these calls for proposals  I try to find a match between my potential ideas and the problem. If there is a match we write a research proposal  get the research funding in  and that's how we start our research programs. But just a spark of imagination is not good enough. How do we develop these kinds of ideas  At our lab RoMeLa  the Robotics and Mechanisms Laboratory  we have these fantastic brainstorming sessions. So  we gather around  we discuss about problems and social problems and talk about it. But before we start we set this golden rule. The rule is  Nobody criticizes anybody's ideas. Nobody criticizes any opinion. This is important  because many times students  they fear or they feel uncomfortable how others might think about their opinions and thoughts. So  once you do this  it is amazing how the students open up. They have these wacky  cool  crazy  brilliant ideas  and the whole room is just electrified with creative energy. And this is how we develop our ideas. Well  we're running out of time. One more thing I want to talk about is  you know  just a spark of idea and development is not good enough. There was a great TED moment  I think it was Sir Ken Robinson  was it  He gave a talk about how education and school kills creativity. Well  actually  there are two sides to the story. So  there is only so much one can do with just ingenious ideas and creativity and good engineering intuition. If you want to go beyond a tinkering  if you want to go beyond a hobby of robotics and really tackle the grand challenges of robotics through rigorous research we need more than that. This is where school comes in. Batman  fighting against bad guys  he has his utility belt  he has his grappling hook  he has all different kinds of gadgets. For us roboticists  engineers and scientists  these tools  these are the courses and classes you take in class. Math  differential equations. I have linear algebra  science  physics  even nowadays  chemistry and biology  as you've seen. These are all the tools that we need. So  the more tools you have  for Batman  more effective at fighting the bad guys  for us  more tools to attack these kinds of big problems. So  education is very important. Also  it's not about that  only about that. You also have to work really  really hard. So  I always tell my students   Work smart  then work hard.  This picture in the back this is   a.m. in the morning. I guarantee if you come to your lab at       am we have students working there  not because I tell them to  but because we are having too much fun. Which leads to the last topic  Do not forget to have fun. That's really the secret of our success  we're having too much fun. I truly believe that highest productivity comes when you're having fun  and that's what we're doing. There you go. Thank you so much. Thank you. I have two missions here today. The first is to tell you something about pollen  I hope  and to convince you that it's more than just something that gets up your nose. And  secondly  to convince you that every home really ought to have a scanning electron microscope. Pollen is a flower's way of making more flowers. It carries male sex cells from one flower to another. This gives us genetic diversity  or at least it gives the plants genetic diversity. And it's really rather better not to mate with yourself. That's probably true of humans as well  mostly. Pollen is produced by the anthers of flowers. Each anther can carry up to         grains of pollen  so  it's quite prolific stuff. And it isn't just bright flowers that have pollen  it's also trees and grasses. And remember that all our cereal crops are grasses as well. Here is a scanning electron micrograph of a grain of pollen. The little hole in the middle  we'll come to a bit later  but that's for the pollen tube to come out later on. A very tiny tube. So  that's    micrometers across  that pollen grain there. That's about a   th of a millimeter. But not all pollen is quite so simple looking. This is Morina. This is a plant    which I've always thought to be rather tedious    named after Morin  who was an enterprising French gardener  who issued the first seed catalog in     . But anyway  take a look at its pollen. This is amazing  I think. That little hole in the middle there is for the pollen tube  and when the pollen finds its special female spot in another Morina flower  just on the right species  what happens  Like I said  pollen carries the male sex cells. If you actually didn't realize that plants have sex  they have rampant  promiscuous and really quite interesting and curious sex. Really. My story is actually not about plant propagation  but about pollen itself.  So  what are pollen's properties   I hear you ask. First of all  pollen is tiny. Yes we know that. It's also very biologically active  as anyone with hay fever will understand. Now  pollen from plants  which are wind dispersed    like trees and grasses and so on    tend to cause the most hay fever. And the reason for that is they've got to chuck out masses and masses of pollen to have any chance of the pollen reaching another plant of the same species. Here are some examples    they're very smooth if you look at them    of tree pollen that is meant to be carried by the wind. Again    this time  sycamore    wind dispersed. So  trees  very boring flowers  not really trying to attract insects. Cool pollen  though. This one I particularly like. This is the Monterey Pine  which has little air sacks to make the pollen carry even further. Remember  that thing is just about    micrometers across. Now  it's much more efficient if you can get insects to do your bidding. This is a bee's leg with the pollen glommed onto it from a mallow plant. And this is the outrageous and beautiful flower of the mangrove palm. Very showy  to attract lots of insects to do its bidding. The pollen has little barbs on it  if we look. Now  those little barbs obviously stick to the insects well  but there is something else that we can tell from this photograph  and that is that you might be able to see a fracture line across what would be the equator of this  if it was the Earth. That tells me that it's actually been fossilized  this pollen. And I'm rather proud to say that this was found just near London  and that    million years ago London was full of mangroves. Isn't that cool  Okay  so this is another species evolved to be dispersed by insects. You can tell that from the little barbs on there. All these pictures were taken with a scanning electron microscope  actually in the lab at Kew Laboratories. No coincidence that these were taken by Rob Kesseler  who is an artist  and I think it's someone with a design and artistic eye like him that has managed to bring out the best in pollen. Now  all this diversity means that you can look at a pollen grain and tell what species it came from  and that's actually quite handy if you maybe have a sample and you want to see where it came from. So  different species of plants grow in different places  and some pollen carries further than others. So  if you have a pollen sample  then in principle  you should be able to tell where that sample came from. And this is where it gets interesting for forensics. Pollen is tiny. It gets on to things  and it sticks to them. So  not only does each type of pollen look different  but each habitat has a different combination of plants. A different pollen signature  if you like  or a different pollen fingerprint. By looking at the proportions and combinations of different kinds of pollen in a sample  you can tell very precisely where it came from. This is some pollen embedded in a cotton shirt  similar to the one that I'm wearing now. Now  much of the pollen will still be there after repeated washings. Where has it been  Four very different habitats might look similar  but they've got very different pollen signatures. Actually this one is particularly easy  these pictures were all taken in different countries. But pollen forensics can be very subtle. It's being used now to track where counterfeit drugs have been made  where banknotes have come from  to look at the provenance of antiques and see that they really did come from the place the seller said they did. And murder suspects have been tracked using their clothing  certainly in the U.K.  to within an area that's small enough that you can send in tracker dogs to find the murder victim. So  you can tell from a piece of clothing to within about a kilometer or so  where that piece of clothing has been recently and then send in dogs. And finally  in a rather grizzly way  the Bosnia war crimes  some of the people brought to trial were brought to trial because of the evidence from pollen  which showed that bodies had been buried  exhumed and then reburied somewhere else. I hope I've opened your eyes  if you'll excuse the visual pun   Laughter  to some of pollen's secrets. This is a horse chestnut. There is an invisible beauty all around us  each grain with a story to tell ... each of us  in fact  with a story to tell from the pollen fingerprint that's upon us. Thank you to the colleagues at Kew  and thank you to palynologists everywhere.   My age is three hundred     and seventy two     I think with the deepest regret     How I used to pick up and voraciously chew     the dear little boys that I met     I've eaten them raw in their holiday suits      Eaten them curried with rice      I've eaten them baked in their jackets and boots      And found them exceedingly nice.     But now that my jaws are too weak for such fare      I think it's increasingly rude     To do such a thing when I'm quite well aware     Little boys do not like being chewed.     Little boys do not like being chewed.     So now I contentedly live upon eels      And try to do nothing amiss     And pass all the time I can spare from my meals     In innocent slumber like this      Innocent slumber like this.   I suppose I owe you an explanation. I've been working on a project for the last six years adapting children's poetry to music. And that's a poem by Charles Edward Carryl  who was a stockbroker in New York City for    years  but in the evenings  he wrote nonsense for his children. And this book was one of the most famous books in America for about    years.  The Sleepy Giant   which is the song that I just sang  is one of his poems. Now  we're going to do other poems for you  and here's a preview of some of the poets. This is Rachel Field  Robert Graves    a very young Robert Graves    Christina Rossetti. Ghosts  right  Have nothing to say to us  obsolete  gone    not so. What I really enjoyed about this project is reviving these people's words. Taking them off the dead  flat pages. Bringing them to life  bringing them to light. So  what we're going to do next is a poem that was written by Nathalia Crane. Nathalia Crane was a little girl from Brooklyn. When she was    years old in       she published her first book of poems called  The Janitor's Boy.  Here she is. And here's her poem.   Oh  I'm in love with the janitor's boy      And the janitor's boy is in love with me.     Oh  I'm in love with the janitor's boy      And the janitor's boy is in love with me.     He's going to hunt for a desert isle     In our geography.     A desert isle with spicy trees     Somewhere in Sheepshead Bay      A right nice place  just fit for two     Where we can live always.     Oh  I'm in love with the janitor's boy      And the janitor's boy    he's busy as can be      Down in the cellar he's making a raft     Out of an old settee.     He'll carry me off  I know that he will      For his hair is exceedingly red      And the only thing that occurs to me     Is to dutifully shiver in bed.     And on the day that we sail  I will leave a little note     For my parents I hate to annoy       I have flown to an island in the bay     With my janitor's red haired boy.      The janitor's red haired boy     The janitor's red haired boy     The janitor's red haired boy     The janitor's red haired boy     I'm going to sail away     Gone to Sheepshead Bay     With my janitor's red haired boy.     On an old settee     My red haired boy and me     The janitor's red haired boy.     The janitor's red haired boy     The janitor's red haired boy     The janitor's red haired boy     The janitor's red haired boy   The next poem is by E.E. Cummings   Maggie and Milly and Molly and May.    Maggie and Milly  Molly and May     They went down to the beach one day to play     And Maggie discovered a shell that sang     So sweetly she couldn't remember her troubles     Maggie and Milly  Molly and May     Maggie and Milly  Molly and May     Milly befriended a stranded star     Whose rays  whose rays     Five languid fingers were     Maggie and Milly  Molly and May     Maggie and Milly  Molly and May     Molly was chased by a horrible thing     Which raced sideways blowing     Blowing     Blowing     May came home with a smooth  round stone     Small as a world and as large as alone     For whatever we lose like a you or a me     Always ourselves that we find at the sea   Thank you. The next poem is  If No One Ever Marries Me.  It was written by Laurence Alma Tadema. She was the daughter of a very  very famous Dutch painter who had made his fame in England. He went there after the death of his wife of smallpox and brought his two young children. One was his daughter  Laurence. She wrote this poem when she was    years old in       and I look at it as kind of a very sweet feminist manifesto tinged with a little bit of defiance and a little bit of resignation and regret.   Well  if no one ever marries me     And I don't see why they should      Nurse says I'm not pretty      And you know I'm seldom good  seldom good        Well  if no one ever marries me     I shan't mind very much      Buy a squirrel in a cage     And a little rabbit hutch.     If no one marries me     If no one marries me     If no one marries me     If no one marries me     If no one marries me     I'll have a cottage near a wood     And a pony all my own     A little lamb quite clean and tame     That I can take to town.     And when I'm really getting old        And    or nine        Buy myself a little orphan girl     And bring her up as mine.     If no one marries me     If no one marries me     If no one marries me     If no one marries me     Well  if no one marries me     Marries me     Well  if no one marries me     Marries me     Well  if no one marries me   Thank you. I became very curious about the poets after spending six years with them  and started to research their lives  and then decided to write a book about it. And the burning question about Alma Tadema was  Did she marry  And the answer was no  which I found in the London Times archive. She died alone in      in the company of her books and her dear friends. Gerard Manley Hopkins  a saintly man. He became a Jesuit. He converted from his Anglican faith. He was moved to by the Tractarian Movement  the Oxford Movement  otherwise known as    and he became a Jesuit priest. He burned all his poetry at the age of    and then did not write another poem for at least seven years because he couldn't rectify the life of a poet with the life of a priest. He died typhoid fever at the age of     I believe     or   . At the time  he was teaching classics at Trinity College in Dublin. A few years before he died  after he had resumed writing poetry  but in secret  he confessed to a friend in a letter that I found when I was doing my research   I've written a verse. It is to explain death to a child  and it deserves a piece of plain song music.  And my blood froze when I read that because I had written the plain song music     years after he'd written the letter. And the poem is called   Spring and Fall.    Margaret  are you grieving     Over Goldengrove unleaving  by and by      Leaves  like the things of man  you     With your fresh thoughts care for  can you      But as the heart grows older     It will come to such sights much colder     By and by  nor spare a sigh     Though worlds of wanwood leafmeal lie      And yet you will weep and you'll know why.     No matter child  the name      Sorrow's springs are all the same     They're all the same.     Nor mouth had nor no mind expressed     What heart heard of  ghost had guessed      It's the blight man was born for      It is Margaret that you mourn for   Thank you so much. I'd like to thank everybody  all the scientists  the philosophers  the architects  the inventors  the biologists  the botanists  the artists ... everyone that blew my mind this week. Thank you.

Curb the enthusiasm  just a little bit. Just bring it down a little.  Laughter  It's my turn. I still have two minutes. Okay  we're going to start that verse again.   Well  you've been so ...   That's innovative  don't you think  Calming the audience down  I'm supposed to be whipping you into a frenzy  and I   That's enough. Sh.   Laughter    Now  you've been kind and ...   I'm going to sing this to Bill Gates.  Laughter  I have so much admiration for him.   Now  you've been so kind and generous      I don't know how you keep on giving.     And for your kindness I'm in debt to you.     And I never could have come this far without you.

Laughter   Clapping    I want to thank you  thank you     Thank you  thank you     Thank you  thank you     Thank you  thank you     I want to thank you  thank you   It works better  right    I want to thank you  thank you     I want to thank you     Ooh hoo     Ooh hoo     Ooh hoo     Ooh hoo   Let's bring it down. Decrescendo. Gradually  bringing it down  bringing it down.   I want to thank you  thank you   Finger popping  ain't no stopping. Thank you so much. Let's pretend right here we have a machine. A big machine  a cool  TED ish machine  and it's a time machine. And everyone in this room has to get into it. And you can go backwards  you can go forwards  you cannot stay where you are. And I wonder what you'd choose  because I've been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back. I don't know. They want to go back before there were automobiles or Twitter or  American Idol.  I don't know. I'm convinced that there's some sort of pull to nostalgia  to wishful thinking. And I understand that. I'm not part of that crowd  I have to say. I don't want to go back  and it's not because I'm adventurous. It's because possibilities on this planet  they don't go back  they go forward. So I want to get in the machine  and I want to go forward. This is the greatest time there's ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose  health  wealth  mobility  opportunity  declining rates of disease ... There's never been a time like this. My great grandparents died  all of them  by the time they were   . My grandparents pushed that number to   . My parents are closing in on   . So there better be a nine at the beginning of my death number. But it's not even about people like us  because this is a bigger deal than that. A kid born in New Delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did     years ago. Think about that  it's an incredible fact. And why is it true  Smallpox. Smallpox killed billions of people on this planet. It reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no war ever has. It's gone. It's vanished. We vanquished it. Puff. In the rich world  diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist  hardly. Diphtheria  rubella  polio ... does anyone even know what those things are  Vaccines  modern medicine  our ability to feed billions of people  those are triumphs of the scientific method. And to my mind  the scientific method    trying stuff out  seeing if it works  changing it when it doesn't    is one of the great accomplishments of humanity. So that's the good news. Unfortunately  that's all the good news because there are some other problems  and they've been mentioned many times. And one of them is that despite all our accomplishments  a billion people go to bed hungry in this world every day. That number's rising  and it's rising really rapidly  and it's disgraceful. And not only that  we've used our imagination to thoroughly trash this globe. Potable water  arable land  rainforests  oil  gas  they're going away  and they're going away soon  and unless we innovate our way out of this mess  we're going away too. So the question is  Can we do that  And I think we can. I think it's clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on. I think we can power this world with energy that doesn't also destroy it. I really do believe that  and  no  it ain't wishful thinking. But here's the thing that keeps me up at night    one of the things that keeps me up at night  We've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now. Never. And we've also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can today. We're on the verge of amazing  amazing events in many fields  and yet I actually think we'd have to go back hundreds      years  before the Enlightenment  to find a time when we battled progress  when we fought about these things more vigorously  on more fronts  than we do now. People wrap themselves in their beliefs  and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free. Not even the truth will set them free. And  listen  everyone's entitled to their opinion  they're even entitled to their opinion about progress. But you know what you're not entitled to  You're not entitled to your own facts. Sorry  you're not. And this took me awhile to figure out. About a decade ago  I wrote a story about vaccines for The New Yorker. A little story. And I was amazed to find opposition  opposition to what is  after all  the most effective public health measure in human history. I didn't know what to do  so I just did what I do  I wrote a story and I moved on. And soon after that  I wrote a story about genetically engineered food. Same thing  only bigger. People were going crazy. So I wrote a story about that too  and I couldn't understand why people thought this was  Frankenfoods   why they thought moving molecules around in a specific  rather than a haphazard way  was trespassing on nature's ground. But  you know  I do what I do. I wrote the story  I moved on. I mean  I'm a journalist. We type  we file  we go to dinner. It's fine. But these stories bothered me  and I couldn't figure out why  and eventually I did. And that's because those fanatics that were driving me crazy weren't actually fanatics at all. They were thoughtful people  educated people  decent people. They were exactly like the people in this room. And it just disturbed me so much. But then I thought  you know  let's be honest. We're at a point in this world where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to. We talk about it ambivalently. We talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it   progress.  Okay  there are reasons for that  and I think we know what those reasons are. We've lost faith in institutions  in authority  and sometimes in science itself  and there's no reason we shouldn't have. You can just say a few names and people will understand. Chernobyl  Bhopal  the Challenger  Vioxx  weapons of mass destruction  hanging chads. You know  you can choose your list. There are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right  so be skeptical. Ask questions  demand proof  demand evidence. Don't take anything for granted. But here's the thing  When you get proof  you need to accept the proof  and we're not that good at doing that. And the reason that I can say that is because we're now in an epidemic of fear like one I've never seen and hope never to see again. About    years ago  there was a story published  a horrible story  that linked the epidemic of autism to the measles  mumps and rubella vaccine shot. Very scary. Tons of studies were done to see if this was true. Tons of studies should have been done  it's a serious issue. The data came back. The data came back from the United States  from England  from Sweden  from Canada  and it was all the same  no correlation  no connection  none at all. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter because we believe anecdotes  we believe what we see  what we think we see  what makes us feel real. We don't believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data  and I do understand that  I think we all do. But you know what  The result of that has been disastrous. Disastrous because here's a fact  The United States is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for measles is going down. That is disgraceful  and we should be ashamed of ourselves. It's horrible. What kind of a thing happened that we could do that  Now  I understand it. I do understand it. Because  did anyone have measles here  Has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of measles  Doesn't happen very much. Doesn't happen in this country at all  but it happened         times in the world last year. That's a lot of death of measles       an hour. But since it didn't happen here  we can put it out of our minds  and people like Jenny McCarthy can go around preaching messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like  Oprah  and  Larry King Live.  And they can do it because they don't link causation and correlation. They don't understand that these things seem the same  but they're almost never the same. And it's something we need to learn  and we need to learn it really soon. This guy was a hero  Jonas Salk. He took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us. No fear  no agony. Polio    puff  gone. That guy in the middle  not so much. His name is Paul Offit. He just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people. It'll save the lives of     to         kids in the developing world every year. Pretty good  right  Well  it's good  except that Paul goes around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are and that people ought to just stop the whining. And he actually says it that way. So  Paul's a terrorist. When Paul speaks in a public hearing  he can't testify without armed guards. He gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school. And why  Because Paul made a vaccine. I don't need to say this  but vaccines are essential. You take them away  disease comes back  horrible diseases. And that's happening. We have measles in this country now. And it's getting worse  and pretty soon kids are going to die of it again because it's just a numbers game. And they're not just going to die of measles. What about polio  Let's have that. Why not  A college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought I was a little strident. No one's ever said that before. She wasn't going to vaccinate her kid against polio  no way. Fine. Why  Because we don't have polio. And you know what  We didn't have polio in this country yesterday. Today  I don't know  maybe a guy got on a plane in Lagos this morning  and he's flying to LAX  right now he's over Ohio. And he's going to land in a couple of hours  he's going to rent a car  and he's going to come to Long Beach  and he's going to attend one of these fabulous TED dinners tonight. And he doesn't know that he's infected with a paralytic disease  and we don't either because that's the way the world works. That's the planet we live on. Don't pretend it isn't. Now  we love to wrap ourselves in lies. We love to do it. Everyone take their vitamins this morning  Echinacea  a little antioxidant to get you going. I know you did because half of Americans do every day. They take the stuff  and they take alternative medicines  and it doesn't matter how often we find out that they're useless. The data says it all the time. They darken your urine. They almost never do more than that. It's okay  you want to pay    billion dollars for dark urine  I'm totally with you. Dark urine. Dark. Why do we do that  Why do we do that  Well  I think I understand  we hate Big Pharma. We hate Big Government. We don't trust the Man. And we shouldn't  Our health care system sucks. It's cruel to millions of people. It's absolutely astonishingly cold and soul bending to those of us who can even afford it. So we run away from it  and where do we run  We leap into the arms of Big Placebo. That's fantastic. I love Big Placebo. But  you know  it's really a serious thing because this stuff is crap  and we spend billions of dollars on it. And I have all sorts of little props here. None of it ... ginkgo  fraud  echinacea  fraud  acai    I don't even know what that is but we're spending billions of dollars on it    it's fraud. And you know what  When I say this stuff  people scream at me  and they say   What do you care  Let people do what they want to do. It makes them feel good.  And you know what  You're wrong. Because I don't care if it's the secretary of HHS who's saying   Hmm  I'm not going to take the evidence of my experts on mammograms   or some cancer quack who wants to treat his patient with coffee enemas. When you start down the road where belief and magic replace evidence and science  you end up in a place you don't want to be. You end up in Thabo Mbeki South Africa. He killed         of his people by insisting that beetroot  garlic and lemon oil were much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs we know can slow the course of AIDS. Hundreds of thousands of needless deaths in a country that has been plagued worse than any other by this disease. Please  don't tell me there are no consequences to these things. There are. There always are. Now  the most mindless epidemic we're in the middle of right now is this absurd battle between proponents of genetically engineered food and the organic elite. It's an idiotic debate. It has to stop. It's a debate about words  about metaphors. It's ideology  it's not science. Every single thing we eat  every grain of rice  every sprig of parsley  every Brussels sprout has been modified by man. You know  there weren't tangerines in the garden of Eden. There wasn't any cantaloupe.  Laughter  There weren't Christmas trees. We made it all. We made it over the last        years. And some of it worked  and some of it didn't. We got rid of the stuff that didn't. Now we can do it in a more precise way    and there are risks  absolutely    but we can put something like vitamin A into rice  and that stuff can help millions of people  millions of people  prolong their lives. You don't want to do that  I have to say  I don't understand it. We object to genetically engineered food. Why do we do that  Well  the things I constantly hear are  Too many chemicals  pesticides  hormones  monoculture  we don't want giant fields of the same thing  that's wrong. We don't companies patenting life. We don't want companies owning seeds. And you know what my response to all of that is  Yes  you're right. Let's fix it. It's true  we've got a huge food problem  but this isn't science. This has nothing to do with science. It's law  it's morality  it's patent stuff. You know science isn't a company. It's not a country. It's not even an idea  it's a process. It's a process  and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't  but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we're afraid  is really very deadening  and it's preventing millions of people from prospering. You know  in the next    years we're going to have to grow    percent more food than we do right now     percent. This investment in Africa over the last    years. Disgraceful. Disgraceful. They need it  and we're not giving it to them. And why  Genetically engineered food. We don't want to encourage people to eat that rotten stuff  like cassava for instance. Cassava's something that half a billion people eat. It's kind of like a potato. It's just a bunch of calories. It sucks. It doesn't have nutrients  it doesn't have protein  and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now. And then people would be able to eat it and they'd be able to not go blind. They wouldn't starve  and you know what  That would be nice. It wouldn't be Chez Panisse  but it would be nice. And all I can say about this is  Why are we fighting it  I mean  let's ask ourselves  Why are we fighting it  Because we don't want to move genes around  This is about moving genes around. It's not about chemicals. It's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones  our insistence on having bigger food  better food  singular food. This isn't about Rice Krispies  this is about keeping people alive  and it's about time we started to understand what that meant. Because  you know something  If we don't  if we continue to act the way we're acting  we're guilty of something that I don't think we want to be guilty of  high tech colonialism. There's no other way to describe what's going on here. It's selfish  it's ugly  it's beneath us  and we really have to stop it. So after this amazingly fun conversation  you might want to say   So  you still want to get in this ridiculous time machine and go forward   Absolutely. Absolutely  I do. It's stuck in the present right now  but we have an amazing opportunity. We can set that time machine on anything we want. We can move it where we want to move it  and we're going to move it where we want to move it. We have to have these conversations and we have to think  but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead  we're going to be happy we do. I know that we can  and as far as I'm concerned  that's something the world needs right now. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. In my industry  we believe that images can change the world. Okay  we're naive  we're bright eyed and bushy tailed. The truth is that we know that the images themselves don't change the world  but we're also aware that  since the beginning of photography  images have provoked reactions in people  and those reactions have caused change to happen. So let's begin with a group of images. I'd be extremely surprised if you didn't recognize many or most of them. They're best described as iconic  so iconic  perhaps  they're cliches. In fact  they're so well known that you might even recognize them in a slightly or somewhat different form. But I think we're looking for something more. We're looking for something more. We're looking for images that shine an uncompromising light on crucial issues  images that transcend borders  that transcend religions  images that provoke us to step up and do something    in other words  to act. Well  this image you've all seen. It changed our view of the physical world. We had never seen our planet from this perspective before. Many people credit a lot of the birth of the environmental movement to our seeing the planet like this for the first time    its smallness  its fragility. Forty years later  this group  more than most  are well aware of the destructive power that our species can wield over our environment. And at last  we appear to be doing something about it. This destructive power takes many different forms. For example  these images taken by Brent Stirton in the Congo. These gorillas were murdered  some would even say crucified  and unsurprisingly  they sparked international outrage. Most recently  we've been tragically reminded of the destructive power of nature itself with the recent earthquake in Haiti. Well  I think what is far worse is man's destructive power over man. Samuel Pisar  an Auschwitz survivor  said  and I'll quote him   The Holocaust teaches us that nature  even in its cruelest moments  is benign in comparison with man  when he loses his moral compass and his reason.  There's another kind of crucifixion. The horrifying images from Abu Ghraib as well as the images from Guantanamo had a profound impact. The publication of those images  as opposed to the images themselves  caused a government to change its policies. Some would argue that it is those images that did more to fuel the insurgency in Iraq than virtually any other single act. Furthermore  those images forever removed the so called moral high ground of the occupying forces. Let's go back a little. In the     s and     s  the Vietnam War was basically shown in America's living rooms day in  day out. News photos brought people face to face with the victims of the war  a little girl burned by napalm  a student killed by the National Guard at Kent State University in Ohio during a protest. In fact  these images became the voices of protest themselves. Now  images have power to shed light of understanding on suspicion  ignorance  and in particular    I've given a lot of talks on this but I'll just show one image    the issue of HIV AIDS. In the     s  the stigmatization of people with the disease was an enormous barrier to even discussing or addressing it. A simple act  in       of the most famous woman in the world  the Princess of Wales  touching an HIV AIDS infected baby did a great deal  especially in Europe  to stop that. She  better than most  knew the power of an image. So when we are confronted by a powerful image  we all have a choice  We can look away  or we can address the image. Thankfully  when these photos appeared in The Guardian in       they put a lot of focus and attention and  in the end  a lot of money towards the Sudan famine relief efforts. Did the images change the world  No  but they had a major impact. Images often push us to question our core beliefs and our responsibilities to each other. We all saw those images after Katrina  and I think for millions of people they had a very strong impact. And I think it's very unlikely that they were far from the minds of Americans when they went to vote in November     . Unfortunately  some very important images are deemed too graphic or disturbing for us to see them. I'll show you one photo here  and it's a photo by Eugene Richards of an Iraq War veteran from an extraordinary piece of work  which has never been published  called War Is Personal. But images don't need to be graphic in order to remind us of the tragedy of war. John Moore set up this photo at Arlington Cemetery. After all the tense moments of conflict in all the conflict zones of the world  there's one photograph from a much quieter place that haunts me still  much more than the others. Ansel Adams said  and I'm going to disagree with him   You don't take a photograph  you make it.  In my view  it's not the photographer who makes the photo  it's you. We bring to each image our own values  our own belief systems  and as a result of that  the image resonates with us. My company has    million images. I have one image in my office. Here it is. I hope that the next time you see an image that sparks something in you  you'll better understand why  and I know that speaking to this audience  you'll definitely do something about it. And thank you to all the photographers. First of all  I'm a geek. I'm an organic food eating  carbon footprint minimizing  robotic surgery geek. And I really want to build green  but I'm very suspicious of all of these well meaning articles  people long on moral authority and short on data  telling me how to do these kinds of things. And so I have to figure this out for myself. For example  Is this evil  I have dropped a blob of organic yogurt from happy self actualized local cows on my counter top  and I grab a paper towel and I want to wipe it up. But can I use a paper towel   Laughter  The answer to this can be found in embodied energy. This is the amount of energy that goes into any paper towel or embodied water  and every time I use a paper towel  I am using this much virtual energy and water. Wipe it up  throw it away. Now  if I compare that to a cotton towel that I can use a thousand times  I don't have a whole lot of embodied energy until I wash that yogurty towel. This is now operating energy. So if I throw my towel in the washing machine  I've now put energy and water back into that towel ... unless I use a front loading  high efficiency washing machine   Laughter  and then it looks a little bit better. But what about a recycled paper towel that comes in those little half sheets  Well  now a paper towel looks better. Screw the paper towels. Let's go to a sponge. I wipe it up with a sponge  and I put it under the running water  and I have a lot less energy and a lot more water. Unless you're like me and you leave the handle in the position of hot even when you turn it on  and then you start to use more energy. Or worse  you let it run until it's warm to rinse out your towel. And now all bets are off. So what this says is that sometimes the things that you least expect    the position in which you put the handle    have a bigger effect than any of those other things that you were trying to optimize. Now imagine someone as twisted as me trying to build a house. That's what my husband and I are doing right now. And so  we wanted to know  how green could we be  And there's a thousand and one articles out there telling us how to make all these green trade offs. And they are just as suspect in telling us to optimize these little things around the edges and missing the elephant in the living room. Now  the average house has about     megawatt hours of embodied energy in it  this is the energy it takes to make it    millions and millions of paper towels. We wanted to know how much better we could do. And so  like many people  we start with a house on a lot  and I'm going to show you a typical construction on the top and what we're doing on the bottom. So first  we demolish it. It takes some energy  but if you deconstruct it    you take it all apart  you use the bits    you can get some of that energy back. We then dug a big hole to put in a rainwater catchment tank to take our yard water independent. And then we poured a big foundation for passive solar. Now  you can reduce the embodied energy by about    percent by using high fly ash concrete. We then put in framing. And so this is framing    lumber  composite materials    and it's kind of hard to get the embodied energy out of that  but it can be a sustainable resource if you use FSC certified lumber. We then go on to the first thing that was very surprising. If we put aluminum windows in this house  we would double the energy use right there. Now  PVC is a little bit better  but still not as good as the wood that we chose. We then put in plumbing  electrical and HVAC  and insulate. Now  spray foam is an excellent insulator    it fills in all the cracks    but it is pretty high embodied energy  and  sprayed in cellulose or blue jeans is a much lower energy alternative to that. We also used straw bale infill for our library  which has zero embodied energy. When it comes time to sheetrock  if you use EcoRock it's about a quarter of the embodied energy of standard sheetrock. And then you get to the finishes  the subject of all of those  go green  articles  and on the scale of a house they almost make no difference at all. And yet  all the press is focused on that. Except for flooring. If you put carpeting in your house  it's about a tenth of the embodied energy of the entire house  unless you use concrete or wood for a much lower embodied energy. So now we add in the final construction energy  we add it all up  and we've built a house for less than half of the typical embodied energy for building a house like this. But before we pat ourselves too much on the back  we have poured     megawatt hours of energy into constructing this house when there was a house there before. And so the question is  How could we make that back  And so if I run my new energy efficient house forward  compared with the old  non energy efficient house  we make it back in about six years. Now  I probably would have upgraded the old house to be more energy efficient  and in that case  it would take me more about    years to break even. Now  if I hadn't paid attention to embodied energy  it would have taken us over    years to break even compared to the upgraded house. So what does this mean  On the scale of my portion of the house  this is equivalent to about as much as I drive in a year  it's about five times as much as if I went entirely vegetarian. But my elephant in the living room flies. Clearly  I need to walk home from TED. But all the calculations for embodied energy are on the blog. And  remember  it's sometimes the things that you are not expecting to be the biggest changes that are. Thank you.  Applause  The brilliant playwright  Adrienne Kennedy  wrote a volume called  People Who Led to My Plays.  And if I were to write a volume  it would be called   Artists Who Have Led My Exhibitions  because my work  in understanding art and in understanding culture  has come by following artists  by looking at what artists mean and what they do and who they are. J.J. from  Good Times   significant to many people of course because of  Dy no mite   but perhaps more significant as the first  really  black artist on primetime TV. Jean Michel Basquiat  important to me because  he was  the first black artist in real time that showed me the possibility of who and what I was about to enter into. My overall project is about art    specifically  about black artists    very generally about the way in which art can change the way we think about culture and ourselves. My interest is in artists who understand and rewrite history  who think about themselves within the narrative of the larger world of art  but who have created new places for us to see and understand. I'm showing two artists here   Glenn Ligon and Kara Walker  two of many who really form for me the essential questions that I wanted to bring as a curator to the world. I was interested in the idea of why and how I could create a new story  a new narrative in art history and a new narrative in the world. And to do this  I knew that I had to see the way in which artists work  understand the artist's studio as a laboratory  imagine  then  reinventing the museum as a think tank and looking at the exhibition as the ultimate white paper    asking questions  providing the space to look and to think about answers. In       when I was a curator at the Whitney Museum  I made an exhibition called Black Male. It looked at the intersection of race and gender in contemporary American art. It sought to express the ways in which art could provide a space for dialogue    complicated dialogue  dialogue with many  many points of entry    and how the museum could be the space for this contest of ideas. This exhibition included over    artists of various ages and races  but all looking at black masculinity from a very particular point of view. What was significant about this exhibition is the way in which it engaged me in my role as a curator  as a catalyst  for this dialogue. One of the things that happened very distinctly in the course of this exhibition is I was confronted with the idea of how powerful images can be in people's understanding  of themselves and each other. I'm showing you two works  one on the right by Leon Golub  one on the left by Robert Colescott. And in the course of the exhibition    which was contentious  controversial and ultimately  for me  life changing in my sense of what art could be    a woman came up to me on the gallery floor to express her concern about the nature of how powerful images could be and how we understood each other. And she pointed to the work on the left to tell me how problematic this image was  as it related  for her  to the idea of how black people had been represented. And she pointed to the image on the right as an example  to me  of the kind of dignity that needed to be portrayed to work against those images in the media. She then assigned these works racial identities  basically saying to me that the work on the right  clearly  was made by a black artist  the work on the left  clearly  by a white artist  when  in effect  that was the opposite case  Bob Colescott  African American artist  Leon Golub  a white artist. The point of that for me was to say    in that space  in that moment    that I really  more than anything  wanted to understand how images could work  how images did work  and how artists provided a space bigger than one that we could imagine in our day to day lives to work through these images. Fast forward and I end up in Harlem  home for many of black America  very much the psychic heart of the black experience  really the place where the Harlem Renaissance existed. Harlem now  sort of explaining and thinking of itself in this part of the century  looking both backwards and forwards ... I always say Harlem is an interesting community because  unlike many other places  it thinks of itself in the past  present and the future simultaneously  no one speaks of it just in the now. It's always what it was and what it can be. And  in thinking about that  then my second project  the second question I ask is  Can a museum be a catalyst in a community  Can a museum house artists and allow them to be change agents as communities rethink themselves  This is Harlem  actually  on January   th  thinking about itself in a very wonderful way. So I work now at The Studio Museum in Harlem  thinking about exhibitions there  thinking about what it means to discover art's possibility. Now  what does this mean to some of you  In some cases  I know that many of you are involved in cross cultural dialogues  you're involved in ideas of creativity and innovation. Think about the place that artists can play in that    that is the kind of incubation and advocacy that I work towards  in working with young  black artists. Think about artists  not as content providers  though they can be brilliant at that  but  again  as real catalysts. The Studio Museum was founded in the late   s. And I bring this up because it's important to locate this practice in history. To look at       in the incredible historic moment that it is  and think of the arc that has happened since then  to think of the possibilities that we are all privileged to stand in today and imagine that this museum that came out of a moment of great protest and one that was so much about examining the history and the legacy of important African American artists to the history of art in this country like Jacob Lawrence  Norman Lewis  Romare Bearden. And then  of course  to bring us to today. In       Muhammad Ali gave a lecture at Harvard University. After his lecture  a student got up and said to him   Give us a poem.  And Mohammed Ali said   Me  we.  A profound statement about the individual and the community. The space in which now  in my project of discovery  of thinking about artists  of trying to define what might be black art cultural movement of the   st century. What that might mean for cultural movements all over this moment  the  me  we  seems incredibly prescient totally important. To this end  the specific project that has made this possible for me is a series of exhibitions  all titled with an F    Freestyle  Frequency and Flow    which have set out to discover and define the young  black artists working in this moment who I feel strongly will continue to work over the next many years. This series of exhibitions was made specifically to try and question the idea of what it would mean now  at this point in history  to see art as a catalyst  what it means now  at this point in history  as we define and redefine culture  black culture specifically in my case  but culture generally. I named this group of artists around an idea  which I put out there called post black  really meant to define them as artists who came and start their work now  looking back at history but start in this moment  historically. It is really in this sense of discovery that I have a new set of questions that I'm asking. This new set of questions is  What does it mean  right now  to be African American in America  What can artwork say about this  Where can a museum exist as the place for us all to have this conversation  Really  most exciting about this is thinking about the energy and the excitement that young artists can bring. Their works for me are about  not always just simply about the aesthetic innovation that their minds imagine  that their visions create and put out there in the world  but more  perhaps  importantly  through the excitement of the community that they create as important voices that would allow us right now to understand our situation  as well as in the future. I am continually amazed by the way in which the subject of race can take itself in many places that we don't imagine it should be. I am always amazed by the way in which artists are willing to do that in their work. It is why I look to art. It's why I ask questions of art. It is why I make exhibitions. Now  this exhibition  as I said     young artists done over the course of eight years  and for me it's about considering the implications. It's considering the implications of what this generation has to say to the rest of us. It's considering what it means for these artists to be both out in the world as their work travels  but in their communities as people who are seeing and thinking about the issues that face us. It's also about thinking about the creative spirit and nurturing it  and imagining  particularly in urban America  about the nurturing of the spirit. Now  where  perhaps  does this end up right now  For me  it is about re imagining this cultural discourse in an international context. So the last iteration of this project has been called Flow  with the idea now of creating a real network of artists around the world  really looking  not so much from Harlem and out  but looking across  and Flow looked at artists all born on the continent of Africa. And as many of us think about that continent and think about what if means to us all in the   st century  I have begun that looking through artists  through artworks  and imagining what they can tell us about the future  what they tell us about our future  and what they create in their sense of offering us this great possibility of watching that continent emerge as part of our bigger dialogue. So  what do I discover when I look at artworks  What do I think about when I think about art  I feel like the privilege I've had as a curator is not just the discovery of new works  the discovery of exciting works. But  really  it has been what I've discovered about myself and what I can offer in the space of an exhibition  to talk about beauty  to talk about power  to talk about ourselves  and to talk and speak to each other. That's what makes me get up every day and want to think about this generation of black artists and artists around the world. Thank you.  Applause  In the spirit of Jacques Cousteau  who said   People protect what they love   I want to share with you today what I love most in the ocean  and that's the incredible number and variety of animals in it that make light. My addiction began with this strange looking diving suit called Wasp  that's not an acronym    just somebody thought it looked like the insect. It was actually developed for use by the offshore oil industry for diving on oil rigs down to a depth of       feet. Right after I completed my Ph.D.  I was lucky enough to be included with a group of scientists that was using it for the first time as a tool for ocean exploration. We trained in a tank in Port Hueneme  and then my first open ocean dive was in Santa Barbara Channel. It was an evening dive. I went down to a depth of     feet and turned out the lights. And the reason I turned out the lights is because I knew I would see this phenomenon of animals making light called bioluminescence. But I was totally unprepared for how much there was and how spectacular it was. I saw chains of jellyfish called siphonophores that were longer than this room  pumping out so much light that I could read the dials and gauges inside the suit without a flashlight  and puffs and billows of what looked like luminous blue smoke  and explosions of sparks that would swirl up out of the thrusters    just like when you throw a log on a campfire and the embers swirl up off the campfire  but these were icy  blue embers. It was breathtaking. Now  usually if people are familiar with bioluminescence at all  it's these guys  it's fireflies. And there are a few other land dwellers that can make light    some insects  earthworms  fungi    but in general  on land  it's really rare. In the ocean  it's the rule rather than the exception. If I go out in the open ocean environment  virtually anywhere in the world  and I drag a net from       feet to the surface  most of the animals    in fact  in many places     to    percent of the animals that I bring up in that net    make light. This makes for some pretty spectacular light shows. Now I want to share with you a little video that I shot from a submersible. I first developed this technique working from a little single person submersible called Deep Rover and then adapted it for use on the Johnson Sea Link  which you see here. So  mounted in front of the observation sphere  there's a a three foot diameter hoop with a screen stretched across it. And inside the sphere with me is an intensified camera that's about as sensitive as a fully dark adapted human eye  albeit a little fuzzy. So you turn on the camera  turn out the lights. That sparkle you're seeing is not luminescence  that's just electronic noise on these super intensified cameras. You don't see luminescence until the submersible begins to move forward through the water  but as it does  animals bumping into the screen are stimulated to bioluminesce. Now  when I was first doing this  all I was trying to do was count the numbers of sources. I knew my forward speed  I knew the area  and so I could figure out how many hundreds of sources there were per cubic meter. But I started to realize that I could actually identify animals by the type of flashes they produced. And so  here  in the Gulf of Maine at     feet  I can name pretty much everything you're seeing there to the species level. Like those big explosions  sparks  are from a little comb jelly  and there's krill and other kinds of crustaceans  and jellyfish. There was another one of those comb jellies. And so I've worked with computer image analysis engineers to develop automatic recognition systems that can identify these animals and then extract the XYZ coordinate of the initial impact point. And we can then do the kinds of things that ecologists do on land  and do nearest neighbor distances. But you don't always have to go down to the depths of the ocean to see a light show like this. You can actually see it in surface waters. This is some shot  by Dr. Mike Latz at Scripps Institution  of a dolphin swimming through bioluminescent plankton. And this isn't someplace exotic like one of the bioluminescent bays in Puerto Rico  this was actually shot in San Diego Harbor. And sometimes you can see it even closer than that  because the heads on ships    that's toilets  for any land lovers that are listening    are flushed with unfiltered seawater that often has bioluminescent plankton in it. So  if you stagger into the head late at night and you're so toilet hugging sick that you forget to turn on the light  you may think that you're having a religious experience.  Laughter  So  how does a living creature make light  Well  that was the question that   th century French physiologist Raphael Dubois  asked about this bioluminescent clam. He ground it up and he managed to get out a couple of chemicals  one  the enzyme  he called luciferase  the substrate  he called luciferin after Lucifer the Lightbearer. That terminology has stuck  but it doesn't actually refer to specific chemicals because these chemicals come in a lot of different shapes and forms. In fact  most of the people studying bioluminescence today are focused on the chemistry  because these chemicals have proved so incredibly valuable for developing antibacterial agents  cancer fighting drugs  testing for the presence of life on Mars  detecting pollutants in our waters    which is how we use it at ORCA. In       the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded for work done on a molecule called green fluorescent protein that was isolated from the bioluminescent chemistry of a jellyfish  and it's been equated to the invention of the microscope  in terms of the impact that it has had on cell biology and genetic engineering. Another thing all these molecules are telling us that  apparently  bioluminescence has evolved at least    times  maybe as many as    separate times in evolutionary history  which is a clear indication of how spectacularly important this trait is for survival. So  what is it about bioluminescence that's so important to so many animals  Well  for animals that are trying to avoid predators by staying in the darkness  light can still be very useful for the three basic things that animals have to do to survive  and that's find food  attract a mate and avoid being eaten. So  for example  this fish has a built in headlight behind its eye that it can use for finding food or attracting a mate. And then when it's not using it  it actually can roll it down into its head just like the headlights on your Lamborghini. This fish actually has high beams. And this fish  which is one of my favorites  has three headlights on each side of its head. Now  this one is blue  and that's the color of most bioluminescence in the ocean because evolution has selected for the color that travels farthest through seawater in order to optimize communication. So  most animals make blue light  and most animals can only see blue light  but this fish is a really fascinating exception because it has two red light organs. And I have no idea why there's two  and that's something I want to solve some day    but not only can it see blue light  but it can see red light. So it uses its red bioluminescence like a sniper's scope to be able to sneak up on animals that are blind to red light and be able to see them without being seen. It's also got a little chin barbel here with a blue luminescent lure on it that it can use to attract prey from a long way off. And a lot of animals will use their bioluminescence as a lure. This is another one of my favorite fish. This is a viperfish  and it's got a lure on the end of a long fishing rod that it arches in front of the toothy jaw that gives the viperfish its name. The teeth on this fish are so long that if they closed inside the mouth of the fish  it would actually impale its own brain. So instead  it slides in grooves on the outside of the head. This is a Christmas tree of a fish  everything on this fish lights up  it's not just that lure. It's got a built in flashlight. It's got these jewel like light organs on its belly that it uses for a type of camouflage that obliterates its shadow  so when it's swimming around and there's a predator looking up from below  it makes itself disappear. It's got light organs in the mouth  it's got light organs in every single scale  in the fins  in a mucus layer on the back and the belly  all used for different things    some of which we know about  some of which we don't. And we know a little bit more about bioluminescence thanks to Pixar  and I'm very grateful to Pixar for sharing my favorite topic with so many people. I do wish  with their budget  that they might have spent just a tiny bit more money to pay a consulting fee to some poor  starving graduate student  who could have told them that those are the eyes of a fish that's been preserved in formalin. These are the eyes of a living anglerfish. So  she's got a lure that she sticks out in front of this living mousetrap of needle sharp teeth in order to attract in some unsuspecting prey. And this one has a lure with all kinds of little interesting threads coming off it. Now we used to think that the different shape of the lure was to attract different types of prey  but then stomach content analyses on these fish done by scientists  or more likely their graduate students  have revealed that they all eat pretty much the same thing. So  now we believe that the different shape of the lure is how the male recognizes the female in the anglerfish world  because many of these males are what are known as dwarf males. This little guy has no visible means of self support. He has no lure for attracting food and no teeth for eating it when it gets there. His only hope for existence on this planet is as a gigolo.  Laughter  He's got to find himself a babe and then he's got to latch on for life. So this little guy has found himself this babe  and you will note that he's had the good sense to attach himself in a way that he doesn't actually have to look at her. But he still knows a good thing when he sees it  and so he seals the relationship with an eternal kiss. His flesh fuses with her flesh  her bloodstream grows into his body  and he becomes nothing more than a little sperm sac. Well  this is a deep sea version of Women's Lib. She always knows where he is  and she doesn't have to be monogamous  because some of these females come up with multiple males attached. So they can use it for finding food  for attracting mates. They use it a lot for defense  many different ways. A lot of them can release their luciferin or luferase in the water just the way a squid or an octopus will release an ink cloud. This shrimp is actually spewing light out of its mouth like a fire breathing dragon in order to blind or distract this viperfish so that the shrimp can swim away into the darkness. And there are a lot of different animals that can do this  There's jellyfish  there's squid  there's a whole lot of different crustaceans  there's even fish that can do this. This fish is called the shining tubeshoulder because it actually has a tube on its shoulder that can squirt out light. And I was luck enough to capture one of these when we were on a trawling expedition off the northwest coast of Africa for  Blue Planet   for the deep portion of  Blue Planet.  And we were using a special trawling net that we were able to bring these animals up alive. So we captured one of these  and I brought it into the lab. So I'm holding it  and I'm about to touch that tube on its shoulder  and when I do  you'll see bioluminescence coming out. But to me  what's shocking is not just the amount of light  but the fact that it's not just luciferin and luciferase. For this fish  it's actually whole cells with nuclei and membranes. It's energetically very costly for this fish to do this  and we have no idea why it does it    another one of these great mysteries that needs to be solved. Now  another form of defense is something called a burglar alarm    same reason you have a burglar alarm on your car  the honking horn and flashing lights are meant to attract the attention of  hopefully  the police that will come and take the burglar away    when an animal's caught in the clutches of a predator  its only hope for escape may be to attract the attention of something bigger and nastier that will attack their attacker  thereby affording them a chance for escape. This jellyfish  for example  has a spectacular bioluminescent display. This is us chasing it in the submersible. That's not luminescence  that's reflected light from the gonads. We capture it in a very special device on the front of the submersible that allows us to bring it up in really pristine condition  bring it into the lab on the ship. And then to generate the display you're about to see  all I did was touch it once per second on its nerve ring with a sharp pick that's sort of like the sharp tooth of a fish. And once this display gets going  I'm not touching it anymore. This is an unbelievable light show. It's this pinwheel of light  and I've done calculations that show that this could be seen from as much as     feet away by a predator. And I thought   You know  that might actually make a pretty good lure.  Because one of the things that's frustrated me as a deep sea explorer is how many animals there probably are in the ocean that we know nothing about because of the way we explore the ocean. The primary way that we know about what lives in the ocean is we go out and drag nets behind ships. And I defy you to name any other branch of science that still depends on hundreds of year old technology. The other primary way is we go down with submersibles and remote operated vehicles. I've made hundreds of dives in submersibles. When I'm sitting in a submersible though  I know that I'm not unobtrusive at all    I've got bright lights and noisy thrusters    any animal with any sense is going to be long gone. So  I've wanted for a long time to figure out a different way to explore. And so  sometime ago  I got this idea for a camera system. It's not exactly rocket science. We call this thing Eye in the Sea. And scientists have done this on land for years  we just use a color that the animals can't see and then a camera that can see that color. You can't use infrared in the sea. We use far red light  but even that's a problem because it gets absorbed so quickly. Made an intensified camera  wanted to make this electronic jellyfish. Thing is  in science  you basically have to tell the funding agencies what you're going to discover before they'll give you the money. And I didn't know what I was going to discover  so I couldn't get the funding for this. So I kluged this together  I got the Harvey Mudd Engineering Clinic to actually do it as an undergraduate student project initially  and then I kluged funding from a whole bunch of different sources. Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute gave me time with their ROV so that I could test it and we could figure out  you know  for example  which colors of red light we had to use so that we could see the animals  but they couldn't see us    get the electronic jellyfish working. And you can see just what a shoestring operation this really was  because we cast these    blue LEDs in epoxy and you can see in the epoxy mold that we used  the word Ziploc is still visible. Needless to say  when it's kluged together like this  there were a lot of trials and tribulations getting this working. But there came a moment when it all came together  and everything worked. And  remarkably  that moment got caught on film by photographer Mark Richards  who happened to be there at the precise moment that we discovered that it all came together. That's me on the left  my graduate student at the time  Erika Raymond  and Lee Fry  who was the engineer on the project. And we have this photograph posted in our lab in a place of honor with the caption   Engineer satisfying two women at once.   Laughter  And we were very  very happy. So now we had a system that we could actually take to some place that was kind of like an oasis on the bottom of the ocean that might be patrolled by large predators. And so  the place that we took it to was this place called a Brine Pool  which is in the northern part of the Gulf of Mexico. It's a magical place. And I know this footage isn't going to look like anything to you    we had a crummy camera at the time    but I was ecstatic. We're at the edge of the Brine Pool  there's a fish that's swimming towards the camera. It's clearly undisturbed by us. And I had my window into the deep sea. I  for the first time  could see what animals were doing down there when we weren't down there disturbing them in some way. Four hours into the deployment  we had programmed the electronic jellyfish to come on for the first time. Eighty six seconds after it went into its pinwheel display  we recorded this  This is a squid  over six feet long  that is so new to science  it cannot be placed in any known scientific family. I could not have asked for a better proof of concept. And based on this  I went back to the National Science Foundation and said   This is what we will discover.  And they gave me enough money to do it right  which has involved developing the world's first deep sea webcam    which has been installed in the Monterey Canyon for the past year    and now  more recently  a modular form of this system  a much more mobile form that's a lot easier to launch and recover  that I hope can be used on Sylvia's  hope spots  to help explore and protect these areas  and  for me  learn more about the bioluminescence in these  hope spots.  So one of these take home messages here is  there is still a lot to explore in the oceans. And Sylvia has said that we are destroying the oceans before we even know what's in them  and she's right. So if you ever  ever get an opportunity to take a dive in a submersible  say yes    a thousand times  yes    and please turn out the lights. I promise  you'll love it. Thank you. Good morning. Happy to see so many fine folks out here and so many smiling faces. I have a very peculiar background  attitude and approach to the real world because I am a conjurer. Now  I prefer that term over magician  because if I were a magician  that would mean that I use spells and incantations and weird gestures in order to accomplish real magic. No  I don't do that  I'm a conjurer  who is someone who pretends to be a real magician.  Laughter  Now  how do we go about that sort of thing  We depend on the fact that audiences  such as yourselves  will make assumptions. For example  when I walked up here and I took the microphone from the stand and switched it on  you assumed this was a microphone  which it is not. As a matter of fact  this is something that about half of you  more than half of you will not be familiar with. It's a beard trimmer  you see  And it makes a very bad microphone  I've tried it many times.  Laughter  The other assumption that you made    and this little lesson is to show you that you will make assumptions. Not only that you can  but that you will when they are properly suggested to you. You believe I'm looking at you. Wrong. I'm not looking at you. I can't see you. I know you're out there  they told me backstage  it's a full house and such. I know you're there because I can hear you  but I can't see you because I normally wear glasses. These are not glasses  these are empty frames.  Laughter  Quite empty frames. Now why would a grown man appear before you wearing empty frames on his face  To fool you  ladies and gentlemen  to deceive you  to show that you  too  can make assumptions. Don't you ever forget that. Now  I have to do something    first of all  switch to real glasses so I can actually see you  which would probably be a convenience. I don't know. I haven't had a good look. Well  it's not that great a convenience. I have to do something now  which seems a little bit strange for a magician. But I'm going to take some medication. This is a full bottle of Calms Forte. I'll explain that in just a moment. Ignore the instructions  that's what the government has to put in there to confuse you  I'm sure. I will take enough of these. Mm. Indeed  the whole container. Thirty two tablets of Calms Forte. Now that I've done that    I'll explain it in a moment    I must tell you that I am an actor. I'm an actor who plays a specific part. I play the part of a magician  a wizard  if you will  a real wizard. If someone were to appear on this stage in front of me and actually claim to be an ancient prince of Denmark named Hamlet  you would be insulted and rightly so. Why would a man assume that you would believe something bizarre like this  But there exists out there a very large population of people who will tell you that they have psychic  magical powers that they can predict the future  that they can make contact with the deceased. Oh  they also say they will sell you astrology or other fortunetelling methods. Oh  they gladly sell you that  yes. And they also say that they can give you perpetual motion machines and free energy systems. They claim to be psychics  or sensitives  whatever they can. But the one thing that has made a big comeback just recently is this business of speaking with the dead. Now  to my innocent mind  dead implies incapable of communicating.  Laughter  You might agree with me on that. But these people  they tend to tell you that not only can they communicate with the dead     Hi  there     but they can hear the dead as well  and they can relay this information back to the living. I wonder if that's true. I don't think so  because this subculture of people use exactly the same gimmicks that we magicians do  exactly the same    the same physical methods  the same psychological methods    and they effectively and profoundly deceive millions of people around the earth  to their detriment. They deceive these people  costs them a lot of money  cost them a lot of emotional anguish. Billions of dollars are spent every year  all over the globe  on these charlatans. Now  I have two questions I would like to ask these people if I had the opportunity to do so. First question  If I want to ask them to call up    because they do hear them through the ear. They listen to the spirits like this    I'm going to ask you to call up the ghost of my grandmother because  when she died  she had the family will  and she secreted it someplace. We don't know where it is  so we ask Granny   Where is the will  Granny   What does Granny say  She says   I'm in heaven and it's wonderful. I'm here with all my old friends  my deceased friends  and my family and all the puppy dogs and the kittens that I used to have when I was a little girl. And I love you  and I'll always be with you. Good bye.  And she didn't answer the damn question  Where is the will  Now  she could easily have said   Oh  it's in the library on the second shelf  behind the encyclopedia   but she doesn't say that. No  she doesn't. She doesn't bring any useful information to us. We paid a lot of money for that information  be we didn't get it. The second question that I'd like to ask  rather simple  Suppose I ask them to contact the spirit of my deceased father in law  as an example. Why do they insist on saying    remember  they speak into this ear    why do they say   My name starts with J or M   Is this a hunting game  Hunting and fishing  What is it  Is it    questions  No  it's more like     questions. But it is a cruel  vicious  absolutely conscienceless    I'll be all right  keep your seats  Laughter     game that these people play. And they take advantage of the innocent  the naive  the grieving  the needy people out there. Now  this is a process that is called cold reading. There's one fellow out there  Van Praagh is his name  James Van Praagh. He's one of the big practitioners of this sort of thing. John Edward  Sylvia Browne and Rosemary Altea  they are other operators. There are hundreds of them all over the earth  but in this country  James Van Praagh is very big. And what does he do  He likes to tell you how the deceased got deceased  the people he's talking to through his ear  you see  So what he says is  very often  is like this  he says   He tells me  he tells me  before he passed  that he had trouble breathing.  Folks  that's what dying is all about  You stop breathing  and then you're dead. It's that simple. And that's the kind of information they're going to bring back to you  I don't think so. Now  these people will make guesses  they'll say things like   Why am I getting electricity  He's saying to me  'Electricity.' Was he an electrician    No.   Did he ever have an electric razor    No.  It was a game of hunting questions like this. This is what they go through. Now  folks often ask us at the James Randi Educational Foundation  they call me  they say   Why are you so concerned about this  Mr. Randi  Isn't it just a lot of fun   No  it is not fun. It is a cruel farce. Now  it may bring a certain amount of comfort  but that comfort lasts only about    minutes or so. And then the people look in the mirror  and they say  I just paid a lot of money for that reading. And what did she say to me  'I love you '  They always say that. They don't get any information  they don't get any value for what they spend. Now  Sylvia Browne is the big operator. We call her  The Talons.  Sylvia Browne    thank you    Sylvia Browne is the big operator in this field at this very moment. Now  Sylvia Browne    just to show you    she actually gets     dollars for a    minute reading over the telephone  she doesn't even go there in person  and you have to wait up to two years because she's booked ahead that amount of time. You pay by credit card or whatever  and then she will call you sometime in the next two years. You can tell it's her.  Hello  this is Sylvia Browne.  That's her  you can tell right away. Now  Montel Williams is an intelligent man. We all know who he is on television. He's well educated  he's smart  he knows what Sylvia Browne is doing but he doesn't give a damn. He just doesn't care. Because  the bottom line is  the sponsors love it  and he will expose her to television publicity all the time. Now  what does Sylvia Browne give you for that     dollars  She gives you the names of your guardian angels  that's first. Now  without that  how could we possibly function   Laughter  She gives you the names of previous lives  who you were in previous lives. Duh. It turns out that the women that she gives readings for were all Babylonian princesses  or something like that. And the men were all Grecian warriors fighting with Agamemnon. Nothing is ever said about a    year old bootblack in the streets of London who died of consumption. He isn't worth bringing back  obviously. And the strange thing    folks  you may have noticed this too. You see these folks on television    they never call anybody back from hell.  Laughter  Everyone comes back from heaven  but never from hell. If they call back any of my friends  they're not going to... Well  you see the story. Now  Sylvia Browne is an exception  an exception in one way  because the James Randi Educational Foundation  my foundation  offers a one million dollar prize in negotiable bonds. Very simply won. All you have to do is prove any paranormal  occult or supernatural event or power of any kind under proper observing conditions. It's very easy  win the million dollars. Sylvia Browne is an exception in that she's the only professional psychic in the whole world that has accepted our challenge. She did this on the  Larry King Live  show on CNN six and a half years ago. And we haven't heard from her since. Strange. She said that  first of all  that she didn't know how to contact me. Duh. A professional psychic who speaks to dead people  she can't reach me  I'm alive  you may have noticed. Well  pretty well anyway. She couldn't reach me. Now she says she doesn't want to reach me because I'm a godless person. All the more reason to take the million dollars  wouldn't you think  Sylvia  Now these people need to be stopped  seriously now. They need to be stopped because this is a cruel farce. We get people coming to the foundation all the time. They're ruined financially and emotionally because they've given their money and their faith to these people. Now  I popped some pills earlier. I have to explain that to you. Homeopathy  let's find out what that's all about. Hmm. You've heard of it. It's an alternative form of healing  right  Homeopathy actually consists    and that's what this is. This is Calms Forte     caplets of sleeping pills  I forgot to tell you that. I just ingested six and a half days worth of sleeping pills. Six and a half days  that certainly is a fatal dose. It says right on the back here   In case of overdose  contact your poison control center immediately   and it gives an     number. Keep your seats    it's going to be okay. I don't really need it because I've been doing this stunt for audiences all over the world for the last eight or    years  taking fatal doses of homeopathic sleeping pills. Why don't they affect me  The answer may surprise you. What is homeopathy  It's taking a medicine that really works and diluting it down well beyond Avogadro's limit. Diluting it down to the point where there's none of it left.  Laughter  Now folks  this is not just a metaphor I'm going to give you now  it's true. It's exactly equivalent to taking one     milligram aspirin tablet  throwing it into the middle of Lake Tahoe  and then stirring it up  obviously with a very big stick  and waiting two years or so until the solution is homogeneous. Then  when you get a headache  you take a sip of this water  and    voila     it is gone. Now that is true. That is what homeopathy is all about. And another claim that they make    you'll love this one    the more dilute the medicine is  they say  the more powerful it is. Now wait a minute  we heard about a guy in Florida. The poor man  he was on homeopathic medicine. He died of an overdose. He forgot to take his pill. Work on it. Work on it. It's a ridiculous thing. It is absolutely ridiculous. I don't know what we're doing  believing in all this nonsense over all these years. Now  let me tell you  The James Randi Educational Foundation is waving this very big carrot  but I must say  the fact that nobody has taken us up on this offer doesn't mean that the powers don't exist. They might  some place out there. Maybe these people are just independently wealthy. Well  with Sylvia Browne I would think so. You know      dollars for a    minute reading over the telephone    that's more than lawyers make  I mean that's a fabulous amount of money. These people don't need the million dollars perhaps  but wouldn't you think they'd like to take it just to make me look silly  Just to get rid of this godless person out there that Sylvia Browne talks about all the time  I think that something needs to be done about this. We really would love to have suggestions from you folks on how to contact federal  state and local authorities to get them to do something. If you find out    now I understand. We've seen people  even today  speaking to us about AIDS epidemics and starving kids around the world and impure water supplies that people have to suffer with. Those are very important  critically important to us. And we must do something about those problems. But at the same time  as Arthur C. Clarke said  The rotting of the human mind  the business of believing in the paranormal and the occult and the supernatural    all of this total nonsense  this medieval thinking    I think something should be done about that  and it all lies in education. Largely  it's the media who are to blame for this sort of thing. They shamelessly promote all kinds of nonsense of this sort because it pleases the sponsors. It's the bottom line  the dollar line. That's what they're looking at. We really must do something about this. I'm willing to take your suggestions  and I'm willing to have you tune in to our webpage. It's www.randi.org. Go in there and look at the archives  and you will begin to understand much more of what I've been talking about today. You will see the records that we have. There's nothing like sitting in that library and having a family appear there and say that Mum gave away all the family fortune. She cashed in the CDs  she gave away the stocks and the certificates. That's really sad to hear  and it hasn't helped them one bit  hasn't solved any of their problems. Yes  there could be a rotting of the American mind  and of the minds all the way around the earth  if we don't start to think sensibly about these things. Now  we've offered this carrot  as I say  we've dangled the carrot. We're waiting for the psychics to come forth and snap at it. Oh  we get lots of them  hundreds of them every year come by. These are dowsers and people who think that they can talk to the dead as well  but they're amateurs  they don't know how to evaluate their own so called powers. The professionals never come near us  except in that case of Sylvia Browne that I told you about a moment ago. She did accept and then backed away. Ladies and gentlemen  I'm James Randi  and I'm waiting. Thank you. The greatest irony in global health is that the poorest countries carry the largest disease burden. If we resize the countries of the globe in proportion to the subject of interest  we see that Sub Saharan Africa is the worst hit region by HIV AIDS. This is the most devastating epidemic of our time. We also see that this region has the least capability in terms of dealing with the disease. There are very few doctors and  quite frankly  these countries do not have the resources that are needed to cope with such epidemics. So what the Western countries  developed countries  have generously done is they have proposed to provide free drugs to all people in Third World countries who actually can't afford these medications. And this has already saved millions of lives  and it has prevented entire economies from capsizing in Sub Saharan Africa. But there is a fundamental problem that is killing the efforts in fighting this disease  because if you keep throwing drugs out at people who don't have diagnostic services  you end up creating a problem of drug resistance. This is already beginning to happen in Sub Saharan Africa. The problem is that  what begins as a tragedy in the Third World could easily become a global problem. And the last thing we want to see is drug resistant strains of HIV popping up all over the world  because it will make treatment more expensive and it could also restore the pre ARV carnage of HIV AIDS. I experienced this firsthand as a high school student in Uganda. This was in the   s during the peak of the HIV epidemic  before there were any ARVs in Sub Saharan Africa. And during that time  I actually lost more relatives  as well as the teachers who taught me  to HIV AIDS. So this became one of the driving passions of my life  to help find real solutions that could address these kinds of problems. We all know about the miracle of miniaturization. Back in the day  computers used to fill this entire room  and people actually used to work inside the computers. But what electronic miniaturization has done is that it has allowed people to shrink technology into a cell phone. And I'm sure everyone here enjoys cell phones that can actually be used in the remote areas of the world  in the Third World countries. The good news is that the same technology that allowed miniaturization of electronics is now allowing us to miniaturize biological laboratories. So  right now  we can actually miniaturize biological and chemistry laboratories onto microfluidic chips. I was very lucky to come to the US right after high school  and was able to work on this technology and develop some devices. This is a microfluidic chip that I developed. A close look at how the technology works  These are channels that are about the size of a human hair    so you have integrated valves  pumps  mixers and injectors    so you can fit entire diagnostic experiments onto a microfluidic system. So what I plan to do with this technology is to actually take the current state of the technology and build an HIV kit in a microfluidic system. So  with one microfluidic chip  which is the size of an iPhone  you can actually diagnose     patients at the same time. For each patient  we will be able to do up to     different viral loads per patient. And this is only done in four hours     times faster than the current state of the art  at a cost that will be five to     times cheaper than the current options. So this will allow us to create personalized medicines in the Third World at a cost that is actually achievable and make the world a safer place. I invite your interest as well as your involvement in driving this vision to a point of practical reality. Thank you very much. Several years ago here at TED  Peter Skillman introduced a design challenge called the marshmallow challenge. And the idea's pretty simple  Teams of four have to build the tallest free standing structure out of    sticks of spaghetti  one yard of tape  one yard of string and a marshmallow. The marshmallow has to be on top. And  though it seems really simple  it's actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly. And so  I thought this was an interesting idea  and I incorporated it into a design workshop. And it was a huge success. And since then  I've conducted about    design workshops across the world with students and designers and architects  even the CTOs of the Fortune     and there's something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration  and I'd like to share some of them with you. So  normally  most people begin by orienting themselves to the task. They talk about it  they figure out what it's going to look like  they jockey for power. Then they spend some time planning  organizing  they sketch and they lay out spaghetti. They spend the majority of their time assembling the sticks into ever growing structures. And then finally  just as they're running out of time  someone takes out the marshmallow  and then they gingerly put it on top  and then they stand back  and    ta da     they admire their work. But what really happens  most of the time  is that the  ta da  turns into an  uh oh   because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure to buckle and to collapse. So there are a number of people who have a lot more  uh oh  moments than others  and among the worst are recent graduates of business school. They lie  they cheat  they get distracted and they produce really lame structures. And of course there are teams that have a lot more  ta da  structures  and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten. And it's pretty amazing. As Peter tells us  not only do they produce the tallest structures  but they're the most interesting structures of them all. So the question you want to ask is  How come  Why  What is it about them  And Peter likes to say that none of the kids spend any time trying to be CEO of Spaghetti  Inc. Right  They don't spend time jockeying for power. But there's another reason as well. And the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan  right  And then they execute on it. And then what happens is  when they put the marshmallow on the top  they run out of time and what happens  It's a crisis. Sound familiar  Right. What kindergarteners do differently is that they start with the marshmallow  and they build prototypes  successive prototypes  always keeping the marshmallow on top  so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way. Designers recognize this type of collaboration as the essence of the iterative process. And with each version  kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesn't work. So the capacity to play in prototype is really essential  but let's look at how different teams perform. So the average for most people is around    inches  business schools students  about half of that  lawyers  a little better  but not much better than that  kindergarteners  better than most adults. Who does the very best  Architects and engineers  thankfully. Thirty nine inches is the tallest structure I've seen. And why is it  Because they understand triangles and self reinforcing geometrical patterns are the key to building stable structures. So CEOs  a little bit better than average  but here's where it gets interesting. If you put you put an executive admin. on the team  they get significantly better. It's incredible. You know  you look around  you go   Oh  that team's going to win.  You can just tell beforehand. And why is that  Because they have special skills of facilitation. They manage the process  they understand the process. And any team who manages and pays close attention to work will significantly improve the team's performance. Specialized skills and facilitation skills are the combination that leads to strong success. If you have    teams that typically perform  you'll get maybe six or so that have standing structures. And I tried something interesting. I thought  let's up the ante  once. So I offered a        dollar prize of software to the winning team. So what do you think happened to these design students  What was the result  Here's what happened  Not one team had a standing structure. If anyone had built  say  a one inch structure  they would have taken home the prize. So  isn't that interesting  That high stakes have a strong impact. We did the exercise again with the same students. What do you think happened then  So now they understand the value of prototyping. So the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best. They produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time. So there's deep lessons for us about the nature of incentives and success. So  you might ask  Why would anyone actually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge  And the reason is  I help create digital tools and processes to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects. And what the marshmallow challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions. Because  frankly  every project has its own marshmallow  doesn't it  The challenge provides a shared experience  a common language  a common stance to build the right prototype. And so  this is the value of the experience  of this so simple exercise. And those of you who are interested may want to go to MarshmallowChallenge.com. It's a blog that you can look at how to build the marshmallows. There's step by step instructions on this. There are crazy examples from around the world of how people tweak and adjust the system. There's world records that are on this as well. And the fundamental lesson  I believe  is that design truly is a contact sport. It demands that we bring all of our senses to the task  and that we apply the very best of our thinking  our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand. And sometimes  a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an  uh oh  moment to a  ta da  moment. And that can make a big difference. Thank you very much. One of the things that defines a TEDster is you've taken your passion  and you've turned it into stewardship. You actually put action to the issues you care about. But what you're going to find eventually is you may need to actually get elected officials to help you out. So  how do you do that  One of the things I should probably tell you is  I worked for the Discovery Channel early in my career  and that sort of warped my framework. So  when you start to think about politicians  you've got to realize these are strange creatures. Other than the fact that they can't tell directions  and they have very strange breeding habits  how do you actually work with these things   Laughter  What we need to understand is  What drives the political creature  And there are two things that are primary in a politician's heart  One is reputation and influence. These are the primary tools by which a politician can do his job. The second one    unlike most animals  which is survival of the species    this is preservation of self. Now you may think it's money  but that's actually sort of a proxy to what I can do to preserve myself. Now  the challenge with you moving your issue forward is these animals are getting broadcast to all the time. So  what doesn't work  in terms of getting your issue to be important  You can send them an email. Well  unfortunately  I've got so many Viagra ads coming at me  your email is lost. It doesn't matter  it's spam. How about you get on the phone  Well  chances are I've got a droid who's picking up the phone   Yes  they called  and they said they didn't like it.  That doesn't move. Face to face would work  but it's hard to set it up. It's hard to get the context and actually get the communication to work. Yes  contributions actually do make a difference and they set a context for having a conversation  but it takes some time to build up. So what actually works  And the answer is rather strange. It's a letter. We live in a digital world  but we're fairly analog creatures. Letters actually work. Even the top dog himself takes time every day to read    letters that are picked out by staff. I can tell you that every official that I've ever worked with will tell you about the letters they get and what they mean. So  how are you going to write your letter  First of all  you're going to pick up an analog device  a pen. I know these are tough  and you may have a hard time getting your hand bent around it   Laughter  but this is actually critical. And it is critical that you actually handwrite your letter. It is so novel to see this  that somebody actually picked up an analog device and has written to me. Second of all  I'm going to recommend that you get into a proactive stance and write to your elected officials at least once a month. Here's my promise to you  If you are consistent and do this  within three months the elected official will start calling you when that issue comes up and say   What do you think   Now  I'm going to give you a four paragraph format to work with. Now  when you approach these animals  you need to understand there's a dangerous end to them  and you also need to approach them with some level of respect and a little bit of wariness. So in paragraph number one  what I'm going to tell you to do is very simply this  You appreciate them. You may not appreciate the person  you may not appreciate anything else  but maybe you appreciate the fact that they've got a tough gig. When animals are going to make a point  they make the point. They don't spend a lot of time dicking around. So  here you go.  Laughter  Paragraph number two  You may actually have to just get very blunt and say what's really on your mind. When you do this  don't attack people  you attack tactics. Ad hominem attacks will get you nowhere. Paragraph number three  When animals are attacked or cornered  they will fight to the death  so you have to give them an exit. Most of the time  if they have an exit strategy  they should take it.  Obviously  you're intelligent. If you had the right information  you would have done the right thing.   Laughter  Lastly  you want to be the nurturing agent. You're the safe place to come in to. So  in paragraph number four  you're going to tell people   If no one is providing you with this information  let me help.   Laughter  Animals do displays. They do two things  They warn you or they try to attract you and say   We need to mate.  You're going to do that by the way you sign your letter. You do a number of things  you're a vice president  you volunteer  you do something else. Why is is this important  Because this establishes the two primary criteria for the political creature  that you have influence in a large sphere  and that my preservation depends on you. Here is one very quick hack  especially for the feds in the audience. Here's how you mail your letter. First of all  you send the original to the district office. So  you send the copy to the main office. If they follow protocol  they'll pick up the phone and say   Hey  do you have the original   Then some droid in the back puts the name on a tickler and says   Oh  this is an important letter.  And you actually get into the folder that the elected official actually has to read. So  what your letter means  I've got to tell you  we are all in a party  and political officials are the pinatas. We are harangued  lectured to  sold  marketed  but a letter is actually one of the few times that we have honest communication. I got this letter when I was first elected  and I still carry it to every council meeting I go to. This is an opportunity at real dialogue  and if you have stewardship and want to communicate  that dialogue is incredibly powerful. So when you do that  here's what I can promise  You're going to be the     pound gorilla in the forest. Get writing. Salaam. Namaskar. Good morning. Given my TED profile  you might be expecting that I'm going to speak to you about the latest philanthropic trends    the one that's currently got Wall Street and the World Bank buzzing    how to invest in women  how to empower them  how to save them. Not me. I am interested in how women are saving us. They're saving us by redefining and re imagining a future that defies and blurs accepted polarities  polarities we've taken for granted for a long time  like the ones between modernity and tradition  First World and Third World  oppression and opportunity. In the midst of the daunting challenges we face as a global community  there's something about this third way raga that is making my heart sing. What intrigues me most is how women are doing this  despite a set of paradoxes that are both frustrating and fascinating. Why is it that women are  on the one hand  viciously oppressed by cultural practices  and yet at the same time  are the preservers of cultures in most societies  Is the hijab or the headscarf a symbol of submission or resistance  When so many women and girls are beaten  raped  maimed on a daily basis in the name of all kinds of causes    honor  religion  nationality    what allows women to replant trees  to rebuild societies  to lead radical  non violent movements for social change  Is it different women who are doing the preserving and the radicalizing  Or are they one and the same  Are we guilty  as Chimamanda Adichie reminded us at the TED conference in Oxford  of assuming that there is a single story of women's struggles for their rights while there are  in fact  many  And what  if anything  do men have to do with it  Much of my life has been a quest to get some answers to these questions. It's taken me across the globe and introduced me to some amazing people. In the process  I've gathered a few fragments that help me shed some light on this puzzle. Among those who've helped open my eyes to a third way are  a devout Muslim in Afghanistan  a group of harmonizing lesbians in Croatia and a taboo breaker in Liberia. I'm indebted to them  as I am to my parents  who for some set of misdemeanors in their last life  were blessed with three daughters in this one. And for reasons equally unclear to me  seem to be inordinately proud of the three of us. I was born and raised here in India  and I learned from an early age to be deeply suspicious of the aunties and uncles who would bend down  pat us on the head and then say to my parents with no problem at all   Poor things. You only have three daughters. But you're young  you could still try again.  My sense of outrage about women's rights was brought to a boil when I was about   . My aunt  an incredibly articulate and brilliant woman  was widowed early. A flock of relatives descended on her. They took off her colorful sari. They made her wear a white one. They wiped her bindi off her forehead. They broke her bangles. Her daughter  Rani  a few years older than me  sat in her lap bewildered  not knowing what had happened to the confident woman she once knew as her mother. Late that night  I heard my mother begging my father   Please do something Ramu. Can't you intervene   And my father  in a low voice  muttering   I'm just the youngest brother  there's nothing I can do. This is tradition.  That's the night I learned the rules about what it means to be female in this world. Women don't make those rules  but they define us  and they define our opportunities and our chances. And men are affected by those rules too. My father  who had fought in three wars  could not save his own sister from this suffering. By     under the excellent tutelage of my mother  I was therefore  as you might expect  defiantly feminist. On the streets chanting    Hindi   Hindi  We are the women of India. We are not flowers  we are sparks of change.  By the time I got to Beijing in       it was clear to me  the only way to achieve gender equality was to overturn centuries of oppressive tradition. Soon after I returned from Beijing  I leapt at the chance to work for this wonderful organization  founded by women  to support women's rights organizations around the globe. But barely six months into my new job  I met a woman who forced me to challenge all my assumptions. Her name is Sakena Yacoobi. She walked into my office at a time when no one knew where Afghanistan was in the United States. She said to me   It is not about the burka.  She was the most determined advocate for women's rights I had ever heard. She told me women were running underground schools in her communities inside Afghanistan  and that her organization  the Afghan Institute of Learning  had started a school in Pakistan. She said   The first thing anyone who is a Muslim knows is that the Koran requires and strongly supports literacy. The prophet wanted every believer to be able to read the Koran for themselves.  Had I heard right  Was a women's rights advocate invoking religion  But Sakena defies labels. She always wears a headscarf  but I've walked alongside with her on a beach with her long hair flying in the breeze. She starts every lecture with a prayer  but she's a single  feisty  financially independent woman in a country where girls are married off at the age of   . She is also immensely pragmatic.  This headscarf and these clothes   she says   give me the freedom to do what I need to do to speak to those whose support and assistance are critical for this work. When I had to open the school in the refugee camp  I went to see the imam. I told him  'I'm a believer  and women and children in these terrible conditions need their faith to survive.'  She smiles slyly.  He was flattered. He began to come twice a week to my center because women could not go to the mosque. And after he would leave  women and girls would stay behind. We began with a small literacy class to read the Koran  then a math class  then an English class  then computer classes. In a few weeks  everyone in the refugee camp was in our classes.  Sakena is a teacher at a time when to educate women is a dangerous business in Afghanistan. She is on the Taliban's hit list. I worry about her every time she travels across that country. She shrugs when I ask her about safety.  Kavita jaan  we cannot allow ourselves to be afraid. Look at those young girls who go back to school when acid is thrown in their face.  And I smile  and I nod  realizing I'm watching women and girls using their own religious traditions and practices  turning them into instruments of opposition and opportunity. Their path is their own and it looks towards an Afghanistan that will be different. Being different is something the women of Lesbor in Zagreb  Croatia know all too well. To be a lesbian  a dyke  a homosexual in most parts of the world  including right here in our country  India  is to occupy a place of immense discomfort and extreme prejudice. In post conflict societies like Croatia  where a hyper nationalism and religiosity have created an environment unbearable for anyone who might be considered a social outcast. So enter a group of out dykes  young women who love the old music that once spread across that region from Macedonia to Bosnia  from Serbia to Slovenia. These folk singers met at college at a gender studies program. Many are in their   s  some are mothers. Many have struggled to come out to their communities  in families whose religious beliefs make it hard to accept that their daughters are not sick  just queer. As Leah  one of the founders of the group  says   I like traditional music very much. I also like rock and roll. So Lesbor  we blend the two. I see traditional music like a kind of rebellion  in which people can really speak their voice  especially traditional songs from other parts of the former Yugoslav Republic. After the war  lots of these songs were lost  but they are a part of our childhood and our history  and we should not forget them.  Improbably  this LGBT singing choir has demonstrated how women are investing in tradition to create change  like alchemists turning discord into harmony. Their repertoire includes the Croatian national anthem  a Bosnian love song and Serbian duets. And  Leah adds with a grin   Kavita  we especially are proud of our Christmas music  because it shows we are open to religious practices even though Catholic Church hates us LGBT.  Their concerts draw from their own communities  yes  but also from an older generation  a generation that might be suspicious of homosexuality  but is nostalgic for its own music and the past it represents. One father  who had initially balked at his daughter coming out in such a choir  now writes songs for them. In the Middle Ages  troubadours would travel across the land singing their tales and sharing their verses  Lesbor travels through the Balkans like this  singing  connecting people divided by religion  nationality and language. Bosnians  Croats and Serbs find a rare shared space of pride in their history  and Lesbor reminds them that the songs one group often claims as theirs alone really belong to them all. Yesterday  Mallika Sarabhai showed us that music can create a world more accepting of difference than the one we have been given. The world Leymah Gbowee was given was a world at war. Liberia had been torn apart by civil strife for decades. Leymah was not an activist  she was a mother of three. But she was sick with worry  She worried her son would be abducted and taken off to be a child soldier  she worried her daughters would be raped  she worried for their lives. One night  she had a dream. She dreamt she and thousands of other women ended the bloodshed. The next morning at church  she asked others how they felt. They were all tired of the fighting. We need peace  and we need our leaders to know we will not rest until there is peace. Among Leymah's friends was a policewoman who was Muslim. She promised to raise the issue with her community. At the next Friday sermon  the women who were sitting in the side room of the mosque began to share their distress at the state of affairs.  What does it matter   they said   A bullet doesn't distinguish between a Muslim and a Christian.  This small group of women  determined to bring an end to the war  and they chose to use their traditions to make a point  Liberian women usually wear lots of jewelry and colorful clothing. But no  for the protest  they dressed all in white  no makeup. As Leymah said   We wore the white saying we were out for peace.  They stood on the side of the road on which Charles Taylor's motorcade passed every day. They stood for weeks    first just     then     then     then hundreds of women    wearing white  singing  dancing  saying they were out for peace. Eventually  opposing forces in Liberia were pushed to hold peace talks in Ghana. The peace talks dragged on and on and on. Leymah and her sisters had had enough. With their remaining funds  they took a small group of women down to the venue of the peace talks and they surrounded the building. In a now famous CNN clip  you can see them sitting on the ground  their arms linked. We know this in India. It's called a  Hindi . Then things get tense. The police are called in to physically remove the women. As the senior officer approaches with a baton  Leymah stands up with deliberation  reaches her arms up over her head  and begins  very slowly  to untie her headdress that covers her hair. You can see the policeman's face. He looks embarrassed. He backs away. And the next thing you know  the police have disappeared. Leymah said to me later   It's a taboo  you know  in West Africa. If an older woman undresses in front of a man because she wants to  the man's family is cursed.  She said   I don't know if he did it because he believed  but he knew we were not going to leave. We were not going to leave until the peace accord was signed.  And the peace accord was signed. And the women of Liberia then mobilized in support of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf  a woman who broke a few taboos herself becoming the first elected woman head of state in Africa in years. When she made her presidential address  she acknowledged these brave women of Liberia who allowed her to win against a football star    that's soccer for you Americans    no less. Women like Sakena and Leah and Leymah have humbled me and changed me and made me realize that I should not be so quick to jump to assumptions of any kind. They've also saved me from my righteous anger by offering insights into this third way. A Filipina activist once said to me   How do you cook a rice cake  With heat from the bottom and heat from the top.  The protests  the marches  the uncompromising position that women's rights are human rights  full stop. That's the heat from the bottom. That's Malcolm X and the suffragists and gay pride parades. But we also need the heat from the top. And in most parts of the world  that top is still controlled by men. So to paraphrase Marx  Women make change  but not in circumstances of their own choosing. They have to negotiate. They have to subvert tradition that once silenced them in order to give voice to new aspirations. And they need allies from their communities. Allies like the imam  allies like the father who now writes songs for a lesbian group in Croatia  allies like the policeman who honored a taboo and backed away  allies like my father  who couldn't help his sister but has helped three daughters pursue their dreams. Maybe this is because feminism  unlike almost every other social movement  is not a struggle against a distinct oppressor    it's not the ruling class or the occupiers or the colonizers    it's against a deeply held set of beliefs and assumptions that we women  far too often  hold ourselves. And perhaps this is the ultimate gift of feminism  that the personal is in fact the political. So that  as Eleanor Roosevelt said once of human rights  the same is true of gender equality  that it starts in small places  close to home. On the streets  yes  but also in negotiations at the kitchen table and in the marital bed and in relationships between lovers and parents and sisters and friends. And then you realize that by integrating aspects of tradition and community into their struggles  women like Sakena and Leah and Leymah    but also women like Sonia Gandhi here in India and Michelle Bachelet in Chile and Shirin Ebadi in Iran    are doing something else. They're challenging the very notion of Western models of development. They are saying  we don't have to be like you to make change. We can wear a sari or a hijab or pants or a boubou  and we can be party leaders and presidents and human rights lawyers. We can use our tradition to navigate change. We can demilitarize societies and pour resources  instead  into reservoirs of genuine security. It is in these little stories  these individual stories  that I see a radical epic being written by women around the world. It is in these threads that are being woven into a resilient fabric that will sustain communities  that I find hope. And if my heart is singing  it's because in these little fragments  every now and again  you catch a glimpse of a whole  of a whole new world. And she is definitely on her way. Thank you. So I want to talk today about an idea. It's a big idea. Actually  I think it'll eventually be seen as probably the single biggest idea that's emerged in the past century. It's the idea of computation. Now  of course  that idea has brought us all of the computer technology we have today and so on. But there's actually a lot more to computation than that. It's really a very deep  very powerful  very fundamental idea  whose effects we've only just begun to see. Well  I myself have spent the past    years of my life working on three large projects that really try to take the idea of computation seriously. So I started off at a young age as a physicist using computers as tools. Then  I started drilling down  thinking about the computations I might want to do  trying to figure out what primitives they could be built up from and how they could be automated as much as possible. Eventually  I created a whole structure based on symbolic programming and so on that let me build Mathematica. And for the past    years  at an increasing rate  we've been pouring more and more ideas and capabilities and so on into Mathematica  and I'm happy to say that that's led to many good things in R   D and education  lots of other areas. Well  I have to admit  actually  that I also had a very selfish reason for building Mathematica  I wanted to use it myself  a bit like Galileo got to use his telescope     years ago. But I wanted to look not at the astronomical universe  but at the computational universe. So we normally think of programs as being complicated things that we build for very specific purposes. But what about the space of all possible programs  Here's a representation of a really simple program. So  if we run this program  this is what we get. Very simple. So let's try changing the rule for this program a little bit. Now we get another result  still very simple. Try changing it again. You get something a little bit more complicated. But if we keep running this for a while  we find out that although the pattern we get is very intricate  it has a very regular structure. So the question is  Can anything else happen  Well  we can do a little experiment. Let's just do a little mathematical experiment  try and find out. Let's just run all possible programs of the particular type that we're looking at. They're called cellular automata. You can see a lot of diversity in the behavior here. Most of them do very simple things  but if you look along all these different pictures  at rule number     you start to see something interesting going on. So let's take a closer look at rule number    here. So here it is. We're just following this very simple rule at the bottom here  but we're getting all this amazing stuff. It's not at all what we're used to  and I must say that  when I first saw this  it came as a huge shock to my intuition. And  in fact  to understand it  I eventually had to create a whole new kind of science. This science is different  more general  than the mathematics based science that we've had for the past     or so years. You know  it's always seemed like a big mystery  how nature  seemingly so effortlessly  manages to produce so much that seems to us so complex. Well  I think we've found its secret  It's just sampling what's out there in the computational universe and quite often getting things like Rule    or like this. And knowing that starts to explain a lot of long standing mysteries in science. It also brings up new issues  though  like computational irreducibility. I mean  we're used to having science let us predict things  but something like this is fundamentally irreducible. The only way to find its outcome is  effectively  just to watch it evolve. It's connected to  what I call  the principle of computational equivalence  which tells us that even incredibly simple systems can do computations as sophisticated as anything. It doesn't take lots of technology or biological evolution to be able to do arbitrary computation  just something that happens  naturally  all over the place. Things with rules as simple as these can do it. Well  this has deep implications about the limits of science  about predictability and controllability of things like biological processes or economies  about intelligence in the universe  about questions like free will and about creating technology. You know  in working on this science for many years  I kept wondering   What will be its first killer app   Well  ever since I was a kid  I'd been thinking about systematizing knowledge and somehow making it computable. People like Leibniz had wondered about that too     years earlier. But I'd always assumed that to make progress  I'd essentially have to replicate a whole brain. Well  then I got to thinking  This scientific paradigm of mine suggests something different    and  by the way  I've now got huge computation capabilities in Mathematica  and I'm a CEO with some worldly resources to do large  seemingly crazy  projects    So I decided to just try to see how much of the systematic knowledge that's out there in the world we could make computable. So  it's been a big  very complex project  which I was not sure was going to work at all. But I'm happy to say it's actually going really well. And last year we were able to release the first website version of Wolfram Alpha. Its purpose is to be a serious knowledge engine that computes answers to questions. So let's give it a try. Let's start off with something really easy. Hope for the best. Very good. Okay. So far so good. Let's try something a little bit harder. Let's do some mathy thing  and with luck it'll work out the answer and try and tell us some interesting things things about related math. We could ask it something about the real world. Let's say    I don't know    what's the GDP of Spain  And it should be able to tell us that. Now we could compute something related to this  let's say ... the GDP of Spain divided by  I don't know  the    hmmm ... let's say the revenue of Microsoft. The idea is that we can just type this in  this kind of question in  however we think of it. So let's try asking a question  like a health related question. So let's say we have a lab finding that ... you know  we have an LDL level of     for a male aged   . So let's type that in  and now Wolfram Alpha will go and use available public health data and try and figure out what part of the population that corresponds to and so on. Or let's try asking about  I don't know  the International Space Station. And what's happening here is that Wolfram Alpha is not just looking up something  it's computing  in real time  where the International Space Station is right now at this moment  how fast it's going  and so on. So Wolfram Alpha knows about lots and lots of kinds of things. It's got  by now  pretty good coverage of everything you might find in a standard reference library. But the goal is to go much further and  very broadly  to democratize all of this knowledge  and to try and be an authoritative source in all areas. To be able to compute answers to specific questions that people have  not by searching what other people may have written down before  but by using built in knowledge to compute fresh new answers to specific questions. Now  of course  Wolfram Alpha is a monumentally huge  long term project with lots and lots of challenges. For a start  one has to curate a zillion different sources of facts and data  and we built quite a pipeline of Mathematica automation and human domain experts for doing this. But that's just the beginning. Given raw facts or data to actually answer questions  one has to compute  one has to implement all those methods and models and algorithms and so on that science and other areas have built up over the centuries. Well  even starting from Mathematica  this is still a huge amount of work. So far  there are about   million lines of Mathematica code in Wolfram Alpha built by experts from many  many different fields. Well  a crucial idea of Wolfram Alpha is that you can just ask it questions using ordinary human language  which means that we've got to be able to take all those strange utterances that people type into the input field and understand them. And I must say that I thought that step might just be plain impossible. Two big things happened  First  a bunch of new ideas about linguistics that came from studying the computational universe  and second  the realization that having actual computable knowledge completely changes how one can set about understanding language. And  of course  now with Wolfram Alpha actually out in the wild  we can learn from its actual usage. And  in fact  there's been an interesting coevolution that's been going on between Wolfram Alpha and its human users  and it's really encouraging. Right now  if we look at web queries  more than    percent of them get handled successfully the first time. And if you look at things like the iPhone app  the fraction is considerably larger. So  I'm pretty pleased with it all. But  in many ways  we're still at the very beginning with Wolfram Alpha. I mean  everything is scaling up very nicely and we're getting more confident. You can expect to see Wolfram Alpha technology showing up in more and more places  working both with this kind of public data  like on the website  and with private knowledge for people and companies and so on. You know  I've realized that Wolfram Alpha actually gives one a whole new kind of computing that one can call knowledge based computing  in which one's starting not just from raw computation  but from a vast amount of built in knowledge. And when one does that  one really changes the economics of delivering computational things  whether it's on the web or elsewhere. You know  we have a fairly interesting situation right now. On the one hand  we have Mathematica  with its sort of precise  formal language and a huge network of carefully designed capabilities able to get a lot done in just a few lines. Let me show you a couple of examples here. So here's a trivial piece of Mathematica programming. Here's something where we're sort of integrating a bunch of different capabilities here. Here we'll just create  in this line  a little user interface that allows us to do something fun there. If you go on  that's a slightly more complicated program that's now doing all sorts of algorithmic things and creating user interface and so on. But it's something that is very precise stuff. It's a precise specification with a precise formal language that causes Mathematica to know what to do here. Then on the other hand  we have Wolfram Alpha  with all the messiness of the world and human language and so on built into it. So what happens when you put these things together  I think it's actually rather wonderful. With Wolfram Alpha inside Mathematica  you can  for example  make precise programs that call on real world data. Here's a real simple example. You can also just sort of give vague input and then try and have Wolfram Alpha figure out what you're talking about. Let's try this here. But actually I think the most exciting thing about this is that it really gives one the chance to democratize programming. I mean  anyone will be able to say what they want in plain language. Then  the idea is that Wolfram Alpha will be able to figure out what precise pieces of code can do what they're asking for and then show them examples that will let them pick what they need to build up bigger and bigger  precise programs. So  sometimes  Wolfram Alpha will be able to do the whole thing immediately and just give back a whole big program that you can then compute with. Here's a big website where we've been collecting lots of educational and other demonstrations about lots of kinds of things. I'll show you one example here. This is just an example of one of these computable documents. This is probably a fairly small piece of Mathematica code that's able to be run here. Okay. Let's zoom out again. So  given our new kind of science  is there a general way to use it to make technology  So  with physical materials  we're used to going around the world and discovering that particular materials are useful for particular technological purposes. Well  it turns out we can do very much the same kind of thing in the computational universe. There's an inexhaustible supply of programs out there. The challenge is to see how to harness them for human purposes. Something like Rule     for example  turns out to be a really good randomness generator. Other simple programs are good models for processes in the natural or social world. And  for example  Wolfram Alpha and Mathematica are actually now full of algorithms that we discovered by searching the computational universe. And  for example  this    if we go back here    this has become surprisingly popular among composers finding musical forms by searching the computational universe. In a sense  we can use the computational universe to get mass customized creativity. I'm hoping we can  for example  use that even to get Wolfram Alpha to routinely do invention and discovery on the fly  and to find all sorts of wonderful stuff that no engineer and no process of incremental evolution would ever come up with. Well  so  that leads to kind of an ultimate question  Could it be that someplace out there in the computational universe we might find our physical universe  Perhaps there's even some quite simple rule  some simple program for our universe. Well  the history of physics would have us believe that the rule for the universe must be pretty complicated. But in the computational universe  we've now seen how rules that are incredibly simple can produce incredibly rich and complex behavior. So could that be what's going on with our whole universe  If the rules for the universe are simple  it's kind of inevitable that they have to be very abstract and very low level  operating  for example  far below the level of space or time  which makes it hard to represent things. But in at least a large class of cases  one can think of the universe as being like some kind of network  which  when it gets big enough  behaves like continuous space in much the same way as having lots of molecules can behave like a continuous fluid. Well  then the universe has to evolve by applying little rules that progressively update this network. And each possible rule  in a sense  corresponds to a candidate universe. Actually  I haven't shown these before  but here are a few of the candidate universes that I've looked at. Some of these are hopeless universes  completely sterile  with other kinds of pathologies like no notion of space  no notion of time  no matter  other problems like that. But the exciting thing that I've found in the last few years is that you actually don't have to go very far in the computational universe before you start finding candidate universes that aren't obviously not our universe. Here's the problem  Any serious candidate for our universe is inevitably full of computational irreducibility. Which means that it is irreducibly difficult to find out how it will really behave  and whether it matches our physical universe. A few years ago  I was pretty excited to discover that there are candidate universes with incredibly simple rules that successfully reproduce special relativity  and even general relativity and gravitation  and at least give hints of quantum mechanics. So  will we find the whole of physics  I don't know for sure  but I think at this point it's sort of almost embarrassing not to at least try. Not an easy project. One's got to build a lot of technology. One's got to build a structure that's probably at least as deep as existing physics. And I'm not sure what the best way to organize the whole thing is. Build a team  open it up  offer prizes and so on. But I'll tell you  here today  that I'm committed to seeing this project done  to see if  within this decade  we can finally hold in our hands the rule for our universe and know where our universe lies in the space of all possible universes ... and be able to type into Wolfram Alpha   the theory of the universe   and have it tell us. So I've been working on the idea of computation now for more than    years  building tools and methods and turning intellectual ideas into millions of lines of code and grist for server farms and so on. With every passing year  I realize how much more powerful the idea of computation really is. It's taken us a long way already  but there's so much more to come. From the foundations of science to the limits of technology to the very definition of the human condition  I think computation is destined to be the defining idea of our future. Thank you. Chris Anderson  That was astonishing. Stay here. I've got a question. So  that was  fair to say  an astonishing talk. Are you able to say in a sentence or two how this type of thinking could integrate at some point to things like string theory or the kind of things that people think of as the fundamental explanations of the universe  Stephen Wolfram  Well  the parts of physics that we kind of know to be true  things like the standard model of physics  what I'm trying to do better reproduce the standard model of physics or it's simply wrong. The things that people have tried to do in the last    years or so with string theory and so on have been an interesting exploration that has tried to get back to the standard model  but hasn't quite gotten there. My guess is that some great simplifications of what I'm doing may actually have considerable resonance with what's been done in string theory  but that's a complicated math thing that I don't yet know how it's going to work out. CA  Benoit Mandelbrot is in the audience. He also has shown how complexity can arise out of a simple start. Does your work relate to his  SW  I think so. I view Benoit Mandelbrot's work as one of the founding contributions to this kind of area. Benoit has been particularly interested in nested patterns  in fractals and so on  where the structure is something that's kind of tree like  and where there's sort of a big branch that makes little branches and even smaller branches and so on. That's one of the ways that you get towards true complexity. I think things like the Rule    cellular automaton get us to a different level. In fact  in a very precise way  they get us to a different level because they seem to be things that are capable of complexity that's sort of as great as complexity can ever get ... I could go on about this at great length  but I won't.  Laughter   Applause  CA  Stephen Wolfram  thank you. Hi  my name is Roz Savage and I row across oceans. Four years ago  I rowed solo across the Atlantic  and since then  I've done two out of three stages across the Pacific  from San Francisco to Hawaii and from Hawaii to Kiribati. And tomorrow  I'll be leaving this boat to fly back to Kiribati to continue with the third and final stage of my row across the Pacific. Cumulatively  I will have rowed over       miles  taken over three million oar strokes and spent more than     days alone on the ocean on a    foot rowboat. This has given me a very special relationship with the ocean. We have a bit of a love hate thing going on. I feel a bit about it like I did about a very strict math teacher that I once had at school. I didn't always like her  but I did respect her  and she taught me a heck of a lot. So today I'd like to share with you some of my ocean adventures and tell you a little bit about what they've taught me  and how I think we can maybe take some of those lessons and apply them to this environmental challenge that we face right now. Now  some of you might be thinking   Hold on a minute. She doesn't look very much like an ocean rower. Isn't she meant to be about this tall and about this wide and maybe look a bit more like these guys   You'll notice  they've all got something that I don't. Well  I don't know what you're thinking  but I'm talking about the beards.  Laughter  And no matter how long I've spent on the ocean  I haven't yet managed to muster a decent beard  and I hope that it remains that way. For a long time  I didn't believe that I could have a big adventure. The story that I told myself was that adventurers looked like this. I didn't look the part. I thought there were them and there were us  and I was not one of them. So for    years  I conformed. I did what people from my kind of background were supposed to do. I was working in an office in London as a management consultant. And I think I knew from day one that it wasn't the right job for me. But that kind of conditioning just kept me there for so many years  until I reached my mid   s and I thought   You know  I'm not getting any younger. I feel like I've got a purpose in this life  and I don't know what it is  but I'm pretty certain that management consultancy is not it. So  fast forward a few years. I'd gone through some changes. To try and answer that question of   What am I supposed to be doing with my life   I sat down one day and wrote two versions of my own obituary  the one that I wanted  a life of adventure  and the one that I was actually heading for which was a nice  normal  pleasant life  but it wasn't where I wanted to be by the end of my life. I wanted to live a life that I could be proud of. And I remember looking at these two versions of my obituary and thinking   Oh boy  I'm on totally the wrong track here. If I carry on living as I am now  I'm just not going to end up where I want to be in five years  or    years  or at the end of my life.  I made a few changes  let go of some loose trappings of my old life  and through a bit of a leap of logic  decided to row across the Atlantic Ocean. The Atlantic Rowing Race runs from the Canaries to Antigua  it's about       miles  and it turned out to be the hardest thing I had ever done. Sure  I had wanted to get outside of my comfort zone  but what I'd sort of failed to notice was that getting out of your comfort zone is  by definition  extremely uncomfortable. And my timing was not great either        when I did the Atlantic  was the year of Hurricane Katrina. There were more tropical storms in the North Atlantic than ever before  since records began. And pretty early on  those storms started making their presence known. All four of my oars broke before I reached halfway across. Oars are not supposed to look like this. But what can you do  You're in the middle of the ocean. Oars are your only means of propulsion. So I just had to look around the boat and figure out what I was going to use to fix up these oars so that I could carry on. So I found a boat hook and my trusty duct tape and splintered the boat hook to the oars to reinforce it. Then  when that gave out  I sawed the wheel axles off my spare rowing seat and used those. And then when those gave out  I cannibalized one of the broken oars. I'd never been very good at fixing stuff when I was living my old life  but it's amazing how resourceful you can become when you're in the middle of the ocean and there's only one way to get to the other side. And the oars kind of became a symbol of just in how many ways I went beyond what I thought were my limits. I suffered from tendinitis on my shoulders and saltwater sores on my bottom. I really struggled psychologically  totally overwhelmed by the scale of the challenge  realizing that  if I carried on moving at two miles an hour        miles was going to take me a very  very long time. There were so many times when I thought I'd hit that limit  but had no choice but to just carry on and try and figure out how I was going to get to the other side without driving myself crazy. And eventually after     days at sea  I arrived in Antigua. I don't think I've ever felt so happy in my entire life. It was a bit like finishing a marathon and getting out of solitary confinement and winning an Oscar all rolled into one. I was euphoric. And to see all the people coming out to greet me and standing along the cliff tops and clapping and cheering  I just felt like a movie star. It was absolutely wonderful. And I really learned then that  the bigger the challenge  the bigger the sense of achievement when you get to the end of it. So this might be a good moment to take a quick time out to answer a few FAQs about ocean rowing that might be going through your mind. Number one that I get asked  What do you eat  A few freeze dried meals  but mostly I try and eat much more unprocessed foods. So I grow my own beansprouts. I eat fruits and nut bars  a lot of nuts. And generally arrive about    pounds lighter at the other end. Question number two  How do you sleep  With my eyes shut. Ha ha. I suppose what you mean is  What happens to the boat while I'm sleeping  Well  I plan my route so that I'm drifting with the winds and the currents while I'm sleeping. On a good night  I think my best ever was    miles in the right direction. Worst ever     miles in the wrong direction. That's a bad day at the office. What do I wear  Mostly  a baseball cap  rowing gloves and a smile    or a frown  depending on whether I went backwards overnight    and lots of sun lotion. Do I have a chase boat  No I don't. I'm totally self supporting out there. I don't see anybody for the whole time that I'm at sea  generally. And finally  Am I crazy  Well  I leave that one up to you to judge. So  how do you top rowing across the Atlantic  Well  naturally  you decide to row across the Pacific. Well  I thought the Atlantic was big  but the Pacific is really  really big. I think we tend to do it a little bit of a disservice in our usual maps. I don't know for sure that the Brits invented this particular view of the world  but I suspect we might have done so  we are right in the middle  and we've cut the Pacific in half and flung it to the far corners of the world. Whereas if you look in Google Earth  this is how the Pacific looks. It pretty much covers half the planet. You can just see a little bit of North America up here and a sliver of Australia down there. It is really big       million square miles    and to row in a straight line across it would be about       miles. Unfortunately  ocean rowboats very rarely go in a straight line. By the time I get to Australia  if I get to Australia  I will have rowed probably nine or        miles in all. So  because nobody in their straight mind would row straight past Hawaii without dropping in  I decided to cut this very big undertaking into three segments. The first attempt didn't go so well. In       I did a rather involuntary capsize drill three times in    hours. A bit like being in a washing machine. Boat got a bit dinged up  so did I. I blogged about it. Unfortunately  somebody with a bit of a hero complex decided that this damsel was in distress and needed saving. The first I knew about this was when the Coast Guard plane turned up overhead. I tried to tell them to go away. We had a bit of a battle of wills. I lost and got airlifted. Awful  really awful. It was one of the worst feelings of my life  as I was lifted up on that winch line into the helicopter and looked down at my trusty little boat rolling around in the    foot waves and wondering if I would ever see her again. So I had to launch a very expensive salvage operation and then wait another nine months before I could get back out onto the ocean again. But what do you do  Fall down nine times  get up   . So  the following year  I set out and  fortunately  this time made it safely across to Hawaii. But it was not without misadventure. My watermaker broke  only the most important piece of kit that I have on the boat. Powered by my solar panels  it sucks in saltwater and turns it into freshwater. But it doesn't react very well to being immersed in ocean  which is what happened to it. Fortunately  help was at hand. There was another unusual boat out there at the same time  doing as I was doing  bringing awareness to the North Pacific Garbage Patch  that area in the North Pacific about twice the size of Texas  with an estimated  .  million tons of trash in it  circulating at the center of that North Pacific Gyre. So  to make the point  these guys had actually built their boat out of plastic trash         empty water bottles latched together into two pontoons. They were going very slowly. Partly  they'd had a bit of a delay. They'd had to pull in at Catalina Island shortly after they left Long Beach because the lids of all the water bottles were coming undone  and they were starting to sink. So they'd had to pull in and do all the lids up. But  as I was approaching the end of my water reserves  luckily  our courses were converging. They were running out of food  I was running out of water. So we liaised by satellite phone and arranged to meet up. And it took about a week for us to actually gradually converge. I was doing a pathetically slow speed of about  .  knots  and they were doing only marginally less pathetic speed of about  .   it was like two snails in a mating dance. But  eventually  we did manage to meet up and Joel hopped overboard  caught us a beautiful  big mahi mahi  which was the best food I'd had in  ooh  at least three months. Fortunately  the one that he caught that day was better than this one they caught a few weeks earlier. When they opened this one up  they found its stomach was full of plastic. And this is really bad news because plastic is not an inert substance. It leaches out chemicals into the flesh of the poor critter that ate it  and then we come along and eat that poor critter  and we get some of the toxins accumulating in our bodies as well. So there are very real implications for human health. I eventually made it to Hawaii still alive. And  the following year  set out on the second stage of the Pacific  from Hawaii down to Tarawa. And you'll notice something about Tarawa  it is very low lying. It's that little green sliver on the horizon  which makes them very nervous about rising oceans. This is big trouble for these guys. They've got no points of land more than about six feet above sea level. And also  as an increase in extreme weather events due to climate change  they're expecting more waves to come in over the fringing reef  which will contaminate their fresh water supply. I had a meeting with the president there  who told me about his exit strategy for his country. He expects that within the next    years  the         people that live there will have to relocate to New Zealand or Australia. And that made me think about how would I feel if Britain was going to disappear under the waves  if the places where I'd been born and gone to school and got married  if all those places were just going to disappear forever. How  literally  ungrounded that would make me feel. Very shortly  I'll be setting out to try and get to Australia  and if I'm successful  I'll be the first woman ever to row solo all the way across the Pacific. And I try to use this to bring awareness to these environmental issues  to bring a human face to the ocean. If the Atlantic was about my inner journey  discovering my own capabilities  maybe the Pacific has been about my outer journey  figuring out how I can use my interesting career choice to be of service to the world  and to take some of those things that I've learned out there and apply them to the situation that humankind now finds itself in. I think there are probably three key points here. The first one is about the stories that we tell ourselves. For so long  I told myself that I couldn't have an adventure because I wasn't six foot tall and athletic and bearded. And then that story changed. I found out that people had rowed across oceans. I even met one of them and she was just about my size. So even though I didn't grow any taller  I didn't sprout a beard  something had changed  My interior dialogue had changed. At the moment  the story that we collectively tell ourselves is that we need all this stuff  that we need oil. But what about if we just change that story  We do have alternatives  and we have the power of free will to choose those alternatives  those sustainable ones  to create a greener future. The second point is about the accumulation of tiny actions. We might think that anything that we do as an individual is just a drop in the ocean  that it can't really make a difference. But it does. Generally  we haven't got ourselves into this mess through big disasters. Yes  there have been the Exxon Valdezes and the Chernobyls  but mostly it's been an accumulation of bad decisions by billions of individuals  day after day and year after year. And  by the same token  we can turn that tide. We can start making better  wiser  more sustainable decisions. And when we do that  we're not just one person. Anything that we do spreads ripples. Other people will see if you're in the supermarket line and you pull out your reusable grocery bag. Maybe if we all start doing this  we can make it socially unacceptable to say yes to plastic in the checkout line. That's just one example. This is a world wide community. The other point  It's about taking responsibility. For so much of my life  I wanted something else to make me happy. I thought if I had the right house or the right car or the right man in my life  then I could be happy. But when I wrote that obituary exercise  I actually grew up a little bit in that moment and realized that I needed to create my own future. I couldn't just wait passively for happiness to come and find me. And I suppose I'm a selfish environmentalist. I plan on being around for a long time  and when I'm    years old  I want to be happy and healthy. And it's very difficult to be happy on a planet that's racked with famine and drought. It's very difficult to be healthy on a planet where we've poisoned the earth and the sea and the air. So  shortly  I'm going to be launching a new initiative called Eco Heroes. And the idea here is that all our Eco Heroes will log at least one green deed every day. It's meant to be a bit of a game. We're going to make an iPhone app out of it. We just want to try and create that awareness because  sure  changing a light bulb isn't going to change the world  but that attitude  that awareness that leads you to change the light bulb or take your reusable coffee mug  that is what could change the world. I really believe that we stand at a very important point in history. We have a choice. We've been blessed  or cursed  with free will. We can choose a greener future  and we can get there if we all pull together to take it one stroke at a time. Thank you. Most of the talks that you've heard in the last several fabulous days have been from people who have the characteristic that they have thought about something  they are experts  they know what's going on. All of you know about the topic that I'm supposed to talk about. That is  you know what simplicity is  you know what complexity is. The trouble is  I don't. And what I'm going to do is share with you my ignorance on this subject. I want you to read this  because we're going to come back to it in a moment. The quote is from the fabled Potter Stewart opinion on pornography. And let me just read it  the important details here   Shorthand description   'hardcore pornography'   and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly defining it. But I know it when I see it.  I'm going to come back to that in a moment. So  what is simplicity  It's good to start with some examples. A coffee cup    we don't think about coffee cups  but it's much more interesting than one might think    a coffee cup is a device  which has a container and a handle. The handle enables you to hold it when the container is filled with hot liquid. Why is that important  Well  it enables you to drink coffee. But also  by the way  the coffee is hot  the liquid is sterile  you're not likely to get cholera that way. So the coffee cup  or the cup with a handle  is one of the tools used by society to maintain public health. Scissors are your clothes  glasses enable you to see things and keep you from being eaten by cheetahs or run down by automobiles  and books are  after all  your education. But there's another class of simple things  which are also very important. Simple in function  but not at all simple in how they're constructed. And the two here are just examples. One is the cellphone  which we use every day. And it rests on a complexity  which has some characteristics very different from those that my friend Benoit Mandelbrot discussed  but are very interesting. And the other  of course  is a birth control pill  which  in a very simple way  fundamentally changed the structure of society by changing the role of women in it by providing to them the opportunity to make reproductive choices. So  there are two ways of thinking about this word  I think. And here I've corrupted the Potter Stewart quotation by saying that we can think about something    which spans all the way from scissors to the cell phone  Internet and birth control pills    by saying that they're simple  the functions are simple  and we recognize what that simplicity is when we see it. Or there may be another way of doing it  which is to think about the problem in terms of what    if you associate with moral philosophers    is called the teapot problem. The teapot problem I'll pose this way. Suppose you see a teapot  and the teapot is filled with hot water. And you then ask the question  Why is the water hot  And that's a simple question. It's like  what is simplicity  One answer would be  because the kinetic energy of the water molecules is high and they bounce against things rapidly    that's a kind of physical science argument. A second argument would be  because it was sitting on a stove with the flame on    that's an historical argument. A third is that I wanted hot water for tea    that's an intentional argument. And  since this is coming from a moral philosopher  the fourth would be that it's part of God's plan for the universe. All of these are possibilities. The point is that you get into trouble when you ask a single question with a single box for an answer  in which that single question actually is many questions with quite different meanings  but with the same words. Asking   What is simplicity   I think falls in that category. What is the state of science  And  interestingly  complexity is very highly evolved. We have a lot of interesting information about what complexity is. Simplicity  for reasons that are a little bit obscure  is almost not pursued  at least in the academic world. We academics    I am an academic    we love complexity. You can write papers about complexity  and the nice thing about complexity is it's fundamentally intractable in many ways  so you're not responsible for outcomes.  Laughter  Simplicity    all of you really would like your Waring Blender in the morning to make whatever a Waring Blender does  but not explode or play Beethoven. You're not interested in the limits of these things. So what one is interested in has a lot to do with the rewards of the system. And there's a lot of rewards in thinking about complexity and emergence  not so much in thinking about simplicity. One of the things I want to do is to help you with a very important task    which you may not know that you have very often    which is to understand how to sit next to a physicist at a dinner party and have a conversation.  Laughter  And the words that I would like you to focus on are complexity and emergence  because these will enable you to start the conversation and then daydream about other things. All right  what is complexity in this view of things  and what is emergence  We have  actually  a pretty good working definition of complexity. It is a system  like traffic  which has components. The components interact with one another. These are cars and drivers. They dissipate energy. It turns out that  whenever you have that system  weird stuff happens  and you in Los Angeles probably know this better than anyone. Here's another example  which I put up because it's an example of really important current science. You can't possibly read that. It's not intended that you read it  but that's a tiny part of the chemical reactions going on in each of your cells at any given moment. And it's like the traffic that you see. The amazing thing about the cell is that it actually does maintain a fairly stable working relationship with other cells  but we don't know why. Anyone who tells you that we understand life  walk away. And let me reduce this to the simplest level. We've heard from Bill Gates recently. All of us  to some extent  study this thing called a Bill Gates. Terrific. You learn everything you can about that. And then there's another kind of thing that you might study  and you study that hard. That's a Bono  this is a Bono. But then  if you know everything you can know about those two things  and you put them together  what can you say about this combination  The answer is  not a lot. And that's complexity. Now  imagine building that up to a city  or to a society  and you've got  obviously  an interesting problem. All right  so let me give you an example of simplicity of a particular kind. And I want to introduce a word that I think is very useful  which is stacking. And I'm going to use stacking for a kind of simplicity that has the characteristic that it is so simple and so reliable that I can build things with it. Or I'm going to use simple to mean reliable  predictable  repeatable. And I'm going to use as an example the Internet  because it's a particularly good example of stacked simplicity. We call it a complex system  which it is  but it's also something else. The Internet starts with mathematics  it starts with binary. And if you look at the list of things on the bottom  we are familiar with the Arabic numbers one to    and so on. In binary  one is       seven is     . The question is  Why is binary simpler than Arabic  And the answer is  simply  that if I hold up three fingers  you can count that easily  but if I hold up this  it's sort of hard to say that I just did seven. The virtue of binary is that it's the simplest possible way of representing numbers. Anything else is more complicated. You can catch errors with it  it's unambiguous in its reading  there are lots of good things about binary. So it is very  very simple once you learn how to read it. Now  if you like to represent this zero and one of binary  you need a device. And think of things in your life that are binary  one of them is light switches. They can be on and off. That's binary. Now wall switches  we all know  fail. But our friends who are condensed matter physicists managed to come up  some    years ago  with a very nice device  shown under that bell jar  which is a transistor. A transistor is nothing more than a wall switch. It turns things on and off  but it does so without moving parts and it doesn't fail  basically  for a very long period of time. So the second layer of simplicity was the transistor in the Internet. So  since the transistor is so simple  you can put lots of them together. And you put lots of them together and you come with something called integrated circuits. And a current integrated circuit might have in each one of these chips something like a billion transistors  all of which have to work perfectly every time. So that's the next layer of simplicity  and  in fact  integrated circuits are really simple in the sense that they  in general  work really well. With integrated circuits  you can build cellphones. You all are accustomed to having your cellphones work the large majority of the time. In Boston ... Boston is a little bit like Namibia in its cell phone coverage   Laughter  so that we're not accustomed to that all the time  but some of the time. But  in fact  if you have cell phones  you can now go to this nice lady who's somewhere like Namibia  and who is extremely happy with the fact that although she does not have an master's degree in electrical engineering from MIT  she's nonetheless able to hack her cell phone to get power in some funny way. And from that comes the Internet. And this is a map of bitflows across the continent. The two blobs that are light in the middle there are the United States and Europe. And then back to simplicity again. So here we have what I think is one of the great ideas  which is Google. Which  in this simple portal makes the claim that it makes accessible all of the world's information. But the point is that that extraordinary simple idea rests on layers of simplicity each compounded into a complexity that is itself simple  in the sense that it is completely reliable. All right  let me then finish off with four general statements  an example and two aphorisms. The characteristics  which I think are useful to think about for simple things  First  they are predictable. Their behavior is predictable. Now  one of the nice characteristics of simple things is you know what it's going to do  in general. So simplicity and predictability are characteristics of simple things. The second is  and this is a real world statement  they're cheap. If you have things that are cheap enough  people will find uses for them  even if they seem very primitive. So  for example  stones. You can build cathedrals out of stones  you just have to know what it does. You carve them in blocks and then you pile them on top of one another  and they support weight. So there has to be function  the function has to be predictable and the cost has to be low. What that means is that you have to have a high performance or value for cost. And then I would propose as this last component that they serve  or have the potential to serve  as building blocks. That is  you can stack them. And stack can mean this way  or it can mean this way  or it can mean in some arbitrary n dimensional space. But if you have something that has a function  and it's really cheap  people will find new ways of putting it together to make new things. Cheap  functional  reliable things unleash the creativity of people who then build stuff that you could not imagine. There's no way of predicting the Internet based on the first transistor. It just is not possible. So these are the components. Now  the example is something that I want to give you from the work that we ourselves do. We are very interested in delivering health care in the developing world  and one of the things that we wish to do in this particular business is to find a way of doing medical diagnosis at as close to zero cost as we can manage. So  how does one do that  This is a world in which there's no electricity  there's no money  there's no medical competence. And I don't want to spend your time in going through the details  but in the lower right hand corner  you see an example of the kind of thing that we have. It's a little paper chip. It has a few things printed on it using the same technology that you use for making comic books  which was the inspiration for this particular idea. And you put a drop  in this case  of urine at the bottom. It wicks its way up into these little branches. You know  no power required. It turns colors. In this particular case  you're reading kidney function. And  since the health care worker of much of this part of the world is an    year old with an AK     who happens to be out of work and is willing to go around and do this sort of thing  he can take a picture of it with his cellphone  send the picture back to where there is a doctor  and the doctor can look at it. So what you've done is to take a technology  which is available everywhere  make a device  which is extremely cheap  and make it in such a fashion that it is very  very reliable. If we can pull this off  if we can build more function  it will be stackable. That is to say  if we can make the basic technology of one or two things work  it will be applicable to a very  very large variety of human conditions  and hence  extendable in both vertical and horizontal directions. Part of my interest in this  I have to say  is that I would like to    how do I put this politely     change the way  or maybe eviscerate  the capital structure of the U.S. health care system  which I think is fundamentally broken. So  let me close    Let me close with my two aphorisms. One of them is from Mr. Einstein  and he says   Everything should be made as simple as possible  but not simpler.  And I think that's a very good way of thinking about the problem. If you take too much out of something that's simple  you lose function. You have to have low cost  but you also have to have a function. So you can't make it too simple. And the second is a design issue  and it's not directly relevant  but it's a nice statement. This is by de Saint Exupery. And he says   You know you've achieved perfection in design  not when you have nothing more to add  but when you have nothing more to take away.  And that certainly is going in the right direction. So  what I think one can begin to do with this kind of cut at the word simplicity  which doesn't cover Brancusi  it doesn't answer the question of why Mondrian is better or worse or simpler or less simpler than Van Gogh  and certainly doesn't address the question of whether Mozart is simpler than Bach. But it does make a point    which is one which  in a sense  differentiates the real world of people who make things  and the world of people who think about things  which is  there is an intellectual merit to asking  How do we make things as simple as we can  as cheap as we can  as functional as we can and as freely interconnectable as we can  If we make that kind of simplicity in our technology and then give it to you guys  you can go off and do all kinds of fabulous things with it. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Quick question. So can you picture that a science of simplicity might get to the point where you could look out at various systems    say a financial system or a legal system  health system    and say   That has got to the point of danger or dysfunctionality for the following reasons  and this is how we might simplify it   George Whitesides  Yes  I think you could. Because if you look at the components from which the system is made and examine their fragility  or their stability  you can probably build a kind of risk assessment based on that basis. CA  Have you started to do that  I mean  with the health system  you got a sort of radical solution on the cost side  but in terms of the system itself  GW  Well  no. How do I put that simply  No. CA  That was a simple  powerful answer. GW  Yes. CA  So  in terms of that diagnostic technology that you've got  where is that  and when do you see that maybe getting rolled out to scale. GW  That's coming out soon. I mean  the systems work  and we have to find out how to manufacture them and do things of this kind  but the basic technology works. CA  You've got a company set up to ... GW  A foundation  a foundation. Not for profit. CA  All right. Well  thank you so much for your talk. Thank you.  Applause  If you go on the TED website  you can currently find there over a full week of TEDTalk videos  over  .  million words of transcripts and millions of user ratings. And that's a huge amount of data. And it got me wondering  If you took all this data and put it through statistical analysis  could you reverse engineer a TEDTalk  Could you create the ultimate TEDTalk  And also  could you create the worst possible TEDTalk that they would still let you get away with  To find this out  I looked at three things  I looked at the topic that you should choose  I looked at how you should deliver it and the visuals onstage. Now  with the topic  There's a whole range of topics you can choose  but you should choose wisely  because your topic strongly correlates with how users will react to your talk. Now  to make this more concrete  let's look at the list of top    words that statistically stick out in the most favorite TEDTalks and in the least favorite TEDTalks. So if you came here to talk about how French coffee will spread happiness in our brains  that's a go. Whereas  if you wanted to talk about your project involving oxygen  girls  aircraft    actually  I would like to hear that talk   Laughter  but statistics say it's not so good. Oh  well. If you generalize this  the most favorite TEDTalks are those that feature topics we can connect with  both easily and deeply  such as happiness  our own body  food  emotions. And the more technical topics  such as architecture  materials and  strangely enough  men  those are not good topics to talk about. How should you deliver your talk  TED is famous for keeping a very sharp eye on the clock  so they're going to hate me for revealing this  because  actually  you should talk as long as they will let you.  Laughter  Because the most favorite TEDTalks are  on average  over    percent longer than the least favorite ones. And this holds true for all ranking lists on TED.com except if you want to have a talk that's beautiful  inspiring or funny. Then  you should be brief.  Laughter  But other than that  talk until they drag you off the stage. Now  while ... While you're pushing the clock  there's a few rules to obey. I found these rules out by comparing the statistics of four word phrases that appear more often in the most favorite TEDTalks as opposed to the least favorite TEDTalks. I'll give you three examples. First of all  I must  as a speaker  provide a service to the audience and talk about what I will give you  instead of saying what I can't have. Secondly  it's imperative that you do not cite The New York Times. And finally  it's okay for the speaker    that's the good news    to fake intellectual capacity. If I don't understand something  I can just say   etc.  etc.  You'll all stay with me. It's perfectly fine. Now  let's go to the visuals. The most obvious visual thing on stage is the speaker. And analysis shows if you want to be among the most favorite TED speakers  you should let your hair grow a little bit longer than average  make sure you wear your glasses and be slightly more dressed up than the average TED speaker. Slides are okay  though you might consider going for props. And now the most important thing  that is the mood onstage. Color plays a very important role. Color closely correlates with the ratings that talks get on the website. For example  fascinating talks contain a statistically high amount of exactly this blue color   Laughter  much more than the average TEDTalk. Ingenious TEDTalks  much more this green color  etc.  et. Now  personally  I think I'm not the first one who has done this analysis  but I'll leave this to your good judgment. So  now it's time to put it all together and design the ultimate TEDTalk. Now  since this is TEDActive  and I learned from my analysis that I should actually give you something  I will not impose the ultimate or worst TEDTalk on you  but rather give you a tool to create your own. And I call this tool the TEDPad. And the TEDPad is a matrix of     specifically selected  highly curated sentences that you can easily piece together to get your own TEDTalk. You only have to make one decision  and that is  Are you going to use the white version for very good TEDTalks  about creativity  human genius  Or are you going to go with a black version  which will allow you to create really bad TEDTalks  mostly about blogs  politics and stuff  So  download it and have fun with it. Now I hope you enjoy the session. I hope you enjoy designing your own ultimate and worst possible TEDTalks. And I hope some of you will be inspired for next year to create this  which I really want to see. Thank you very much. So here it is. You can check  I am short  I'm French  I have a pretty strong French accent  so that's going to be clear in a moment. Maybe a sobering thought and something you all know about. And I suspect many of you gave something to the people of Haiti this year. And there is something else I believe in the back of your mind you also know. That is  every day         children die of entirely preventable causes. That's a Haiti earthquake every eight days. And I suspect many of you probably gave something towards that problem as well  but somehow it doesn't happen with the same intensity. So why is that  Well  here is a thought experiment for you. Imagine you have a few million dollars that you've raised    maybe you're a politician in a developing country and you have a budget to spend. You want to spend it on the poor  How do you go about it  Do you believe the people who tell you that all we need to do is to spend money  That we know how to eradicate poverty  we just need to do more  Or do you believe the people who tell you that aid is not going to help  on the contrary it might hurt  it might exacerbate corruption  dependence  etc.  Or maybe you turn to the past. After all  we have spent billions of dollars on aid. Maybe you look at the past and see. Has it done any good  And  sadly  we don't know. And worst of all  we will never know. And the reason is that    take Africa for example. Africans have already got a lot of aid. These are the blue bars. And the GDP in Africa is not making much progress. Okay  fine. How do you know what would have happened without the aid  Maybe it would have been much worse  or maybe it would have been better. We have no idea. We don't know what the counterfactual is. There's only one Africa. So what do you do  To give the aid  and hope and pray that something comes out of it  Or do you focus on your everyday life and let the earthquake every eight days continue to happen  The thing is  if we don't know whether we are doing any good  we are not any better than the Medieval doctors and their leeches. Sometimes the patient gets better  sometimes the patient dies. Is it the leeches  Is it something else  We don't know. So here are some other questions. They're smaller questions  but they are not that small. Immunization  that's the cheapest way to save a child's life. And the world has spent a lot of money on it  The GAVI and the Gates Foundations are each pledging a lot of money towards it  and developing countries themselves have been doing a lot of effort. And yet  every year at least    million children do not get the immunization they should get. So this is what you call a  last mile problem.  The technology is there  the infrastructure is there  and yet it doesn't happen. So you have your million. How do you use your million to solve this last mile problem  And here's another question  Malaria. Malaria kills almost         people every year  most of them in Sub Saharan Africa  most of them under five. In fact  that is the leading cause of under five mortality. We already know how to kill malaria  but some people come to you and say   You have your millions. How about bed nets   Bed nets are very cheap. For    dollars  you can manufacture and ship an insecticide treated bed net and you can teach someone to use them. And  not only do they protect the people who sleep under them  but they have these great contagion benefits. If half of a community sleeps under a net  the other half also benefits because the contagion of the disease spread. And yet  only a quarter of kids at risk sleep under a net. Societies should be willing to go out and subsidize the net  give them for free  or  for that matter  pay people to use them because of those contagion benefits.  Not so fast   say other people.  If you give the nets for free  people are not going to value them. They're not going to use them  or at least they're not going to use them as bed nets  maybe as fishing nets.  So  what do you do  Do you give the nets for free to maximize coverage  or do you make people pay in order to make sure that they really value them  How do you know  And a third question  Education. Maybe that's the solution  maybe we should send kids to school. But how do you do that  Do you hire teachers  Do you build more schools  Do you provide school lunch  How do you know  So here is the thing. I cannot answer the big question  whether aid did any good or not. But these three questions  I can answer them. It's not the Middle Ages anymore  it's the   st century. And in the   th century  randomized  controlled trials have revolutionized medicine by allowing us to distinguish between drugs that work and drugs that don't work. And you can do the same randomized  controlled trial for social policy. You can put social innovation to the same rigorous  scientific tests that we use for drugs. And in this way  you can take the guesswork out of policy making by knowing what works  what doesn't work and why. And I'll give you some examples with those three questions. So I start with immunization. Here's Udaipur District  Rajasthan. Beautiful. Well  when I started working there  about one percent of children were fully immunized. That's bad  but there are places like that. Now  it's not because the vaccines are not there    they are there and they are free    and it's not because parents do not care about their kids. The same child that is not immunized against measles  if they do get measles  parents will spend thousands of rupees to help them. So you get these empty village subcenters and crowded hospitals. So what is the problem  Well  part of the problem  surely  is people do not fully understand. After all  in this country as well  all sorts of myths and misconceptions go around immunization. So if that's the case  that's difficult  because persuasion is really difficult. But maybe there is another problem as well. It's going from intention to action. Imagine you are a mother in Udaipur District  Rajasthan. You have to walk a few kilometers to get your kids immunized. And maybe when you get there  what you find is this  The subcenter is closed. Ao you have to come back  and you are so busy and you have so many other things to do  you will always tend to postpone and postpone  and eventually it gets too late. Well  if that's the problem  then that's much easier. Because A  we can make it easy  and B  we can maybe give people a reason to act today  rather than wait till tomorrow. So these are simple ideas  but we didn't know. So let's try them. So what we did is we did a randomized  controlled trial in     villages in Udaipur Districts. So the blue dots are selected randomly. We made it easy    I'll tell you how in a moment. In the red dots  we made it easy and gave people a reason to act now. The white dots are comparisons  nothing changed. So we make it easy by organizing this monthly camp where people can get their kids immunized. And then you make it easy and give a reason to act now by adding a kilo of lentils for each immunization. Now  a kilo of lentils is tiny. It's never going to convince anybody to do something that they don't want to do. On the other hand  if your problem is you tend to postpone  then it might give you a reason to act today rather than later. So what do we find  Well  beforehand  everything is the same. That's the beauty of randomization. Afterwards  the camp    just having the camp    increases immunization from six percent to    percent. That's full immunization. That's not bad  that's a good improvement. Add the lentils and you reach to    percent. So here you've got your answer. Make it easy and give a kilo of lentils  you multiply immunization rate by six. Now  you might say   Well  but it's not sustainable. We cannot keep giving lentils to people.  Well  it turns out it's wrong economics  because it is cheaper to give lentils than not to give them. Since you have to pay for the nurse anyway  the cost per immunization ends up being cheaper if you give incentives than if you don't. How about bed nets  Should you give them for free  or should you ask people to pay for them  So the answer hinges on the answer to three simple questions. One is  If people must pay for a bed net  are they going to purchase them  The second one is  If I give bed nets for free  are people going to use them  And the third one is  Do free bed nets discourage future purchase  The third one is important because if we think people get used to handouts  it might destroy markets to distribute free bed nets. Now this is a debate that has generated a lot of emotion and angry rhetoric. It's more ideological than practical  but it turns out it's an easy question. We can know the answer to this question. We can just run an experiment. And many experiments have been run  and they all have the same results  so I'm just going to talk to you about one. And this one that was in Kenya  they went around and distributed to people vouchers  discount vouchers. So people with their voucher could get the bed net in the local pharmacy. And some people get     percent discount  and some people get    percent discounts  and some people get    percent discount  etc. And now we can see what happens. So  how about the purchasing  Well  what you can see is that when people have to pay for their bed nets  the coverage rate really falls down a lot. So even with partial subsidy  three dollars is still not the full cost of a bed net  and now you only have    percent of the people with the bed nets  you lose the health immunity  that's not great. Second thing is  how about the use  Well  the good news is  people  if they have the bed nets  will use the bed nets regardless of how they got it. If they get it for free  they use it. If they have to pay for it  they use it. How about the long term  In the long term  people who got the free bed nets  one year later  were offered the option to purchase a bed net at two dollars. And people who got the free one were actually more likely to purchase the second one than people who didn't get a free one. So people do not get used to handouts  they get used to nets. Maybe we need to give them a little bit more credit. So  that's for bed nets. So you will think   That's great. You know how to immunize kids  you know how to give bed nets.  But what politicians need is a range of options. They need to know  Out of all the things I could do  what is the best way to achieve my goals  So suppose your goal is to get kids into school. There are so many things you could do. You could pay for uniforms  you could eliminate fees  you could build latrines  you could give girls sanitary pads  etc.  etc. So what's the best  Well  at some level  we think all of these things should work. So  is that sufficient  If we think they should work intuitively  should we go for them  Well  in business  that's certainly not the way we would go about it. Consider for example transporting goods. Before the canals were invented in Britain before the Industrial Revolution  goods used to go on horse carts. And then canals were built  and with the same horseman and the same horse  you could carry ten times as much cargo. So should they have continued to carry the goods on the horse carts  on the ground  that they would eventually get there  Well  if that had been the case  there would have been no Industrial Revolution. So why shouldn't we do the same with social policy  In technology  we spend so much time experimenting  fine tuning  getting the absolute cheapest way to do something  so why aren't we doing that with social policy  Well  with experiments  what you can do is answer a simple question. Suppose you have     dollars to spend on various interventions. How many extra years of education do you get for your hundred dollars  Now I'm going to show you what we get with various education interventions. So the first ones are if you want the usual suspects  hire teachers  school meals  school uniforms  scholarships. And that's not bad. For your hundred dollars  you get between one and three extra years of education. Things that don't work so well is bribing parents  just because so many kids are already going to school that you end up spending a lot of money. And here are the most surprising results. Tell people the benefits of education  that's very cheap to do. So for every hundred dollars you spend doing that  you get    extra years of education. And  in places where there are worms  intestinal worms  cure the kids of their worms. And for every hundred dollars  you get almost    extra years of education. So this is not your intuition  this is not what people would have gone for  and yet  these are the programs that work. We need that kind of information  we need more of it  and then we need to guide policy. So now  I started from the big problem  and I couldn't answer it. And I cut it into smaller questions  and I have the answer to these smaller questions. And they are good  scientific  robust answers. So let's go back to Haiti for a moment. In Haiti  about         people died    actually  a bit more by the latest estimate. And the response of the world was great  Two billion dollars got pledged just last month  so that's about        dollars per death. That doesn't sound like that much when you think about it. But if we were willing to spend        dollars for every child under five who dies  that would be    billion per year just for that problem. And yet it doesn't happen. So  why is that  Well  I think what part of the problem is that  in Haiti  although the problem is huge  somehow we understand it  it's localized. You give your money to Doctors Without Borders  you give your money to Partners In Health  and they'll send in the doctors  and they'll send in the lumber  and they'll helicopter things out and in. And the problem of poverty is not like that. So  first  it's mostly invisible  second  it's huge  and third  we don't know whether we are doing the right thing. There's no silver bullet. You cannot helicopter people out of poverty. And that's very frustrating. But look what we just did today. I gave you three simple answers to three questions  Give lentils to immunize people  provide free bed nets  deworm children. With immunization or bed nets  you can save a life for     dollars per life saved. With deworming  you can get an extra year of education for three dollars. So we cannot eradicate poverty just yet  but we can get started. And maybe we can get started small with things that we know are effective. Here's an example of how this can be powerful. Deworming. Worms have a little bit of a problem grabbing the headlines. They are not beautiful and don't kill anybody. And yet  when the young global leader in Davos showed the numbers I gave you  they started Deworm the World. And thanks to Deworm the World  and the effort of many country governments and foundations     million school aged children got dewormed in     . So this evidence is powerful. It can prompt action. So we should get started now. It's not going to be easy. It's a very slow process. You have to keep experimenting  and sometimes ideology has to be trumped by practicality. And sometimes what works somewhere doesn't work elsewhere. So it's a slow process  but there is no other way. These economics I'm proposing  it's like   th century medicine. It's a slow  deliberative process of discovery. There is no miracle cure  but modern medicine is saving millions of lives every year  and we can do the same thing. And now  maybe  we can go back to the bigger question that I started with at the beginning. I cannot tell you whether the aid we have spent in the past has made a difference  but can we come back here in    years and say   What we have done  it really prompted a change for the better.  I believe we can and I hope we will. Thank you. How do you explain when things don't go as we assume  Or better  how do you explain when others are able to achieve things that seem to defy all of the assumptions  For example  Why is Apple so innovative  Year after year  after year  they're more innovative than all their competition. And yet  they're just a computer company. They're just like everyone else. They have the same access to the same talent  the same agencies  the same consultants  the same media. Then why is it that they seem to have something different  Why is it that Martin Luther King led the Civil Rights Movement  He wasn't the only man who suffered in pre civil rights America  and he certainly wasn't the only great orator of the day. Why him  And why is it that the Wright brothers were able to figure out controlled  powered man flight when there were certainly other teams who were better qualified  better funded    and they didn't achieve powered man flight  and the Wright brothers beat them to it. There's something else at play here. About three and a half years ago  I made a discovery. And this discovery profoundly changed my view on how I thought the world worked  and it even profoundly changed the way in which I operate in it. As it turns out  there's a pattern. As it turns out  all the great inspiring leaders and organizations in the world  whether it's Apple or Martin Luther King or the Wright brothers  they all think  act and communicate the exact same way. And it's the complete opposite to everyone else. All I did was codify it  and it's probably the world's simplest idea. I call it the golden circle. Why  How  What  This little idea explains why some organizations and some leaders are able to inspire where others aren't. Let me define the terms really quickly. Every single person  every single organization on the planet knows what they do      percent. Some know how they do it  whether you call it your differentiated value proposition or your proprietary process or your USP. But very  very few people or organizations know why they do what they do. And by  why  I don't mean  to make a profit.  That's a result. It's always a result. By  why   I mean  What's your purpose  What's your cause  What's your belief  Why does your organization exist  Why do you get out of bed in the morning  And why should anyone care  As a result  the way we think  we act  the way we communicate is from the outside in  it's obvious. We go from the clearest thing to the fuzziest thing. But the inspired leaders and the inspired organizations    regardless of their size  regardless of their industry    all think  act and communicate from the inside out. Let me give you an example. I use Apple because they're easy to understand and everybody gets it. If Apple were like everyone else  a marketing message from them might sound like this   We make great computers. They're beautifully designed  simple to use and user friendly. Want to buy one    Meh.  That's how most of us communicate. That's how most marketing and sales are done  that's how we communicate interpersonally. We say what we do  we say how we're different or better and we expect some sort of a behavior  a purchase  a vote  something like that. Here's our new law firm  We have the best lawyers with the biggest clients  we always perform for our clients. Here's our new car  It gets great gas mileage  it has leather seats. Buy our car. But it's uninspiring. Here's how Apple actually communicates.  Everything we do  we believe in challenging the status quo. We believe in thinking differently. The way we challenge the status quo is by making our products beautifully designed  simple to use and user friendly. We just happen to make great computers. Want to buy one   Totally different  right  You're ready to buy a computer from me. I just reversed the order of the information. What it proves to us is that people don't buy what you do  people buy why you do it. This explains why every single person in this room is perfectly comfortable buying a computer from Apple. But we're also perfectly comfortable buying an MP  player from Apple  or a phone from Apple  or a DVR from Apple. As I said before  Apple's just a computer company. Nothing distinguishes them structurally from any of their competitors. Their competitors are equally qualified to make all of these products. In fact  they tried. A few years ago  Gateway came out with flat screen TVs. They're eminently qualified to make flat screen TVs. They've been making flat screen monitors for years. Nobody bought one. Dell came out with MP  players and PDAs  and they make great quality products  and they can make perfectly well designed products    and nobody bought one. In fact  talking about it now  we can't even imagine buying an MP  player from Dell. Why would you buy one from a computer company  But we do it every day. People don't buy what you do  they buy why you do it. The goal is not to do business with everybody who needs what you have. The goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe. Here's the best part  None of what I'm telling you is my opinion. It's all grounded in the tenets of biology. Not psychology  biology. If you look at a cross section of the human brain  from the top down  the human brain is actually broken into three major components that correlate perfectly with the golden circle. Our newest brain  our Homo sapien brain  our neocortex  corresponds with the  what  level. The neocortex is responsible for all of our rational and analytical thought and language. The middle two sections make up our limbic brains  and our limbic brains are responsible for all of our feelings  like trust and loyalty. It's also responsible for all human behavior  all decision making  and it has no capacity for language. In other words  when we communicate from the outside in  yes  people can understand vast amounts of complicated information like features and benefits and facts and figures. It just doesn't drive behavior. When we can communicate from the inside out  we're talking directly to the part of the brain that controls behavior  and then we allow people to rationalize it with the tangible things we say and do. This is where gut decisions come from. Sometimes you can give somebody all the facts and figures  and they say   I know what all the facts and details say  but it just doesn't feel right.  Why would we use that verb  it doesn't  feel  right  Because the part of the brain that controls decision making doesn't control language. The best we can muster up is   I don't know.  It just doesn't feel right.  Or sometimes you say you're leading with your heart or soul. I hate to break it to you  those aren't other body parts controlling your behavior. It's all happening here in your limbic brain  the part of the brain that controls decision making and not language. But if you don't know why you do what you do  and people respond to why you do what you do  then how will you ever get people to vote for you  or buy something from you  or  more importantly  be loyal and want to be a part of what it is that you do. The goal is not just to sell to people who need what you have  the goal is to sell to people who believe what you believe. The goal is not just to hire people who need a job  it's to hire people who believe what you believe. I always say that  you know  if you hire people just because they can do a job  they'll work for your money  but if they believe what you believe  they'll work for you with blood and sweat and tears. Nowhere else is there a better example than with the Wright brothers. Most people don't know about Samuel Pierpont Langley. And back in the early   th century  the pursuit of powered man flight was like the dot com of the day. Everybody was trying it. And Samuel Pierpont Langley had  what we assume  to be the recipe for success. Even now  you ask people   Why did your product or why did your company fail   and people always give you the same permutation of the same three things  under capitalized  the wrong people  bad market conditions. It's always the same three things  so let's explore that. Samuel Pierpont Langley was given        dollars by the War Department to figure out this flying machine. Money was no problem. He held a seat at Harvard and worked at the Smithsonian and was extremely well connected  he knew all the big minds of the day. He hired the best minds money could find and the market conditions were fantastic. The New York Times followed him around everywhere  and everyone was rooting for Langley. Then how come we've never heard of Samuel Pierpont Langley  A few hundred miles away in Dayton Ohio  Orville and Wilbur Wright  they had none of what we consider to be the recipe for success. They had no money  they paid for their dream with the proceeds from their bicycle shop  not a single person on the Wright brothers' team had a college education  not even Orville or Wilbur  and The New York Times followed them around nowhere. The difference was  Orville and Wilbur were driven by a cause  by a purpose  by a belief. They believed that if they could figure out this flying machine  it'll change the course of the world. Samuel Pierpont Langley was different. He wanted to be rich  and he wanted to be famous. He was in pursuit of the result. He was in pursuit of the riches. And lo and behold  look what happened. The people who believed in the Wright brothers' dream worked with them with blood and sweat and tears. The others just worked for the paycheck. They tell stories of how every time the Wright brothers went out  they would have to take five sets of parts  because that's how many times they would crash before supper. And  eventually  on December   th        the Wright brothers took flight  and no one was there to even experience it. We found out about it a few days later. And further proof that Langley was motivated by the wrong thing  The day the Wright brothers took flight  he quit. He could have said   That's an amazing discovery  guys  and I will improve upon your technology   but he didn't. He wasn't first  he didn't get rich  he didn't get famous  so he quit. People don't buy what you do  they buy why you do it. If you talk about what you believe  you will attract those who believe what you believe. But why is it important to attract those who believe what you believe  Something called the law of diffusion of innovation  if you don't know the law  you know the terminology. The first  .   of our population are our innovators. The next   .   of our population are our early adopters. The next     are your early majority  your late majority and your laggards. The only reason these people buy touch tone phones is because you can't buy rotary phones anymore. We all sit at various places at various times on this scale  but what the law of diffusion of innovation tells us is that if you want mass market success or mass market acceptance of an idea  you cannot have it until you achieve this tipping point between    and    percent market penetration  and then the system tips. I love asking businesses   What's your conversion on new business   They love to tell you   It's about    percent   proudly. Well  you can trip over     of the customers. We all have about     who just  get it.  That's how we describe them  right  That's like that gut feeling   Oh  they just get it.  The problem is  How do you find the ones that get it before doing business versus the ones who don't get it  So it's this here  this little gap that you have to close  as Jeffrey Moore calls it   Crossing the Chasm     because  you see  the early majority will not try something until someone else has tried it first. And these guys  the innovators and the early adopters  they're comfortable making those gut decisions. They're more comfortable making those intuitive decisions that are driven by what they believe about the world and not just what product is available. These are the people who stood in line for six hours to buy an iPhone when they first came out  when you could have bought one off the shelf the next week. These are the people who spent        dollars on flat screen TVs when they first came out  even though the technology was substandard. And  by the way  they didn't do it because the technology was so great  they did it for themselves. It's because they wanted to be first. People don't buy what you do  they buy why you do it and what you do simply proves what you believe. In fact  people will do the things that prove what they believe. The reason that person bought the iPhone in the first six hours  stood in line for six hours  was because of what they believed about the world  and how they wanted everybody to see them  They were first. People don't buy what you do  they buy why you do it. So let me give you a famous example  a famous failure and a famous success of the law of diffusion of innovation. First  the famous failure. It's a commercial example. As we said before  the recipe for success is money and the right people and the right market conditions. You should have success then. Look at TiVo. From the time TiVo came out about eight or nine years ago to this current day  they are the single highest quality product on the market  hands down  there is no dispute. They were extremely well funded. Market conditions were fantastic. I mean  we use TiVo as verb. I TiVo stuff on my piece of junk Time Warner DVR all the time. But TiVo's a commercial failure. They've never made money. And when they went IPO  their stock was at about    or    dollars and then plummeted  and it's never traded above   . In fact  I don't think it's even traded above six  except for a couple of little spikes. Because you see  when TiVo launched their product  they told us all what they had. They said   We have a product that pauses live TV  skips commercials  rewinds live TV and memorizes your viewing habits without you even asking.  And the cynical majority said   We don't believe you. We don't need it. We don't like it. You're scaring us.  What if they had said   If you're the kind of person who likes to have total control over every aspect of your life  boy  do we have a product for you. It pauses live TV  skips commercials  memorizes your viewing habits  etc.  etc.  People don't buy what you do  they buy why you do it  and what you do simply serves as the proof of what you believe. Now let me give you a successful example of the law of diffusion of innovation. In the summer of               people showed up on the mall in Washington to hear Dr. King speak. They sent out no invitations  and there was no website to check the date. How do you do that  Well  Dr. King wasn't the only man in America who was a great orator. He wasn't the only man in America who suffered in a pre civil rights America. In fact  some of his ideas were bad. But he had a gift. He didn't go around telling people what needed to change in America. He went around and told people what he believed.  I believe  I believe  I believe   he told people. And people who believed what he believed took his cause  and they made it their own  and they told people. And some of those people created structures to get the word out to even more people. And lo and behold          people showed up on the right day at the right time to hear him speak. How many of them showed up for him  Zero. They showed up for themselves. It's what they believed about America that got them to travel in a bus for eight hours to stand in the sun in Washington in the middle of August. It's what they believed  and it wasn't about black versus white      of the audience was white. Dr. King believed that there are two types of laws in this world  those that are made by a higher authority and those that are made by men. And not until all the laws that are made by men are consistent with the laws made by the higher authority will we live in a just world. It just so happened that the Civil Rights Movement was the perfect thing to help him bring his cause to life. We followed  not for him  but for ourselves. By the way  he gave the  I have a dream  speech  not the  I have a plan  speech. Listen to politicians now  with their comprehensive    point plans. They're not inspiring anybody. Because there are leaders and there are those who lead. Leaders hold a position of power or authority  but those who lead inspire us. Whether they're individuals or organizations  we follow those who lead  not because we have to  but because we want to. We follow those who lead  not for them  but for ourselves. And it's those who start with  why  that have the ability to inspire those around them or find others who inspire them. Thank you very much. I'm an ecologist  mostly a coral reef ecologist. I started out in Chesapeake Bay and went diving in the winter and became a tropical ecologist overnight. And it was really a lot of fun for about    years. I mean  somebody pays you to go around and travel and look at some of the most beautiful places on the planet. And that was what I did. And I ended up in Jamaica  in the West Indies  where the coral reefs were really among the most extraordinary  structurally  that I ever saw in my life. And this picture here  it's really interesting  it shows two things  First of all  it's in black and white because the water was so clear and you could see so far  and film was so slow in the     s and early   s  you took pictures in black and white. The other thing it shows you is that  although there's this beautiful forest of coral  there are no fish in that picture. Those reefs at Discovery Bay  Jamaica were the most studied coral reefs in the world for    years. We were the best and the brightest. People came to study our reefs from Australia  which is sort of funny because now we go to theirs. And the view of scientists about how coral reefs work  how they ought to be  was based on these reefs without any fish. Then  in       there was a hurricane  Hurricane Allen. I put half the lab up in my house. The wind blew very strong. The waves were    to    feet high. And the reefs disappeared  and new islands formed  and we thought   Well  we're real smart. We know that hurricanes have always happened in the past.  And we published a paper in Science  the first time that anybody ever described the destruction on a coral reef by a major hurricane. And we predicted what would happen  and we got it all wrong. And the reason was because of overfishing  and the fact that a last common grazer  a sea urchin  died. And within a few months after that sea urchin dying  the seaweed started to grow. And that is the same reef  that's the same reef    years ago  that's the same reef today. The coral reefs of the north coast of Jamaica have a few percent live coral cover and a lot of seaweed and slime. And that's more or less the story of the coral reefs of the Caribbean  and increasingly  tragically  the coral reefs worldwide. Now  that's my little  depressing story. All of us in our   s and   s have comparable depressing stories. There are tens of thousands of those stories out there  and it's really hard to conjure up much of a sense of well being  because it just keeps getting worse. And the reason it keeps getting worse is that after a natural catastrophe  like a hurricane  it used to be that there was some kind of successional sequence of recovery  but what's going on now is that overfishing and pollution and climate change are all interacting in a way that prevents that. And so I'm going to sort of go through and talk about those three kinds of things. We hear a lot about the collapse of cod. It's difficult to imagine that two  or some historians would say three world wars were fought during the colonial era for the control of cod. Cod fed most of the people of Western Europe. It fed the slaves brought to the Antilles  the song  Jamaica Farewell      Ackee rice salt fish are nice     is an emblem of the importance of salt cod from northeastern Canada. It all collapsed in the   s and the   s         people lost their jobs. And that was the beginning of a kind of serial depletion from bigger and tastier species to smaller and not so tasty species  from species that were near to home to species that were all around the world  and what have you. It's a little hard to understand that  because you can go to a Costco in the United States and buy cheap fish. You ought to read the label to find out where it came from  but it's still cheap  and everybody thinks it's okay. It's hard to communicate this  and one way that I think is really interesting is to talk about sport fish  because people like to go out and catch fish. It's one of those things. This picture here shows the trophy fish  the biggest fish caught by people who pay a lot of money to get on a boat  go to a place off of Key West in Florida  drink a lot of beer  throw a lot of hooks and lines into the water  come back with the biggest and the best fish  and the champion trophy fish are put on this board  where people take a picture  and this guy is obviously really excited about that fish. Well  that's what it's like now  but this is what it was like in the     s from the same boat in the same place on the same board on the same dock. The trophy fish were so big that you couldn't put any of those small fish up on it. And the average size trophy fish weighed     to     pounds  goliath grouper  and if you wanted to go out and kill something  you could pretty much count on being able to catch one of those fish. And they tasted really good. And people paid less in      dollars to catch that than what people pay now to catch those little  tiny fish. And that's everywhere. It's not just the fish  though  that are disappearing. Industrial fishing uses big stuff  big machinery. We use nets that are    miles long. We use longlines that have one million or two million hooks. And we trawl  which means to take something the size of a tractor trailer truck that weighs thousands and thousands of pounds  put it on a big chain  and drag it across the sea floor to stir up the bottom and catch the fish. Think of it as being kind of the bulldozing of a city or of a forest  because it clears it away. And the habitat destruction is unbelievable. This is a photograph  a typical photograph  of what the continental shelves of the world look like. You can see the rows in the bottom  the way you can see the rows in a field that has just been plowed to plant corn. What that was  was a forest of sponges and coral  which is a critical habitat for the development of fish. What it is now is mud  and the area of the ocean floor that has been transformed from forest to level mud  to parking lot  is equivalent to the entire area of all the forests that have ever been cut down on all of the earth in the history of humanity. We've managed to do that in the last     to     years. We tend to think of oil spills and mercury and we hear a lot about plastic these days. And all of that stuff is really disgusting  but what's really insidious is the biological pollution that happens because of the magnitude of the shifts that it causes to entire ecosystems. And I'm going to just talk very briefly about two kinds of biological pollution  one is introduced species and the other is what comes from nutrients. So this is the infamous Caulerpa taxifolia  the so called killer algae. A book was written about it. It's a bit of an embarrassment. It was accidentally released from the aquarium in Monaco  it was bred to be cold tolerant to have in peoples aquaria. It's very pretty  and it has rapidly started to overgrow the once very rich biodiversity of the northwestern Mediterranean. I don't know how many of you remember the movie  The Little Shop of Horrors   but this is the plant of  The Little Shop of Horrors.  But  instead of devouring the people in the shop  what it's doing is overgrowing and smothering virtually all of the bottom dwelling life of the entire northwestern Mediterranean Sea. We don't know anything that eats it  we're trying to do all sorts of genetics and figure out something that could be done  but  as it stands  it's the monster from hell  about which nobody knows what to do. Now another form of pollution that's biological pollution is what happens from excess nutrients. The green revolution  all of this artificial nitrogen fertilizer  we use too much of it. It's subsidized  which is one of the reasons we used too much of it. It runs down the rivers  and it feeds the plankton  the little microscopic plant cells in the coastal water. But since we ate all the oysters and we ate all the fish that would eat the plankton  there's nothing to eat the plankton and there's more and more of it  so it dies of old age  which is unheard of for plankton. And when it dies  it falls to the bottom and then it rots  which means that bacteria break it down. And in the process they use up all the oxygen  and in using up all the oxygen they make the environment utterly lethal for anything that can't swim away. So  what we end up with is a microbial zoo dominated by bacteria and jellyfish  as you see on the left in front of you. And the only fishery left    and it is a commercial fishery    is the jellyfish fishery you see on the right  where there used to be prawns. Even in Newfoundland where we used to catch cod  we now have a jellyfish fishery. And another version of this sort of thing is what is often called red tides or toxic blooms. That picture on the left is just staggering to me. I have talked about it a million times  but it's unbelievable. In the upper right of that picture on the left is almost the Mississippi Delta  and the lower left of that picture is the Texas Mexico border. You're looking at the entire northwestern Gulf of Mexico  you're looking at one toxic dinoflagellate bloom that can kill fish  made by that beautiful little creature on the lower right. And in the upper right you see this black sort of cloud moving ashore. That's the same species. And as it comes to shore and the wind blows  and little droplets of the water get into the air  the emergency rooms of all the hospitals fill up with people with acute respiratory distress. And that's retirement homes on the west coast of Florida. A friend and I did this thing in Hollywood we called Hollywood ocean night  and I was trying to figure out how to explain to actors what's going on. And I said   So  imagine you're in a movie called 'Escape from Malibu' because all the beautiful people have moved to North Dakota  where it's clean and safe. And the only people who are left there are the people who can't afford to move away from the coast  because the coast  instead of being paradise  is harmful to your health.  And then this is amazing. It was when I was on holiday last early autumn in France. This is from the coast of Brittany  which is being enveloped in this green  algal slime. The reason that it attracted so much attention  besides the fact that it's disgusting  is that sea birds flying over it are asphyxiated by the smell and die  and a farmer died of it  and you can imagine the scandal that happened. And so there's this war between the farmers and the fishermen about it all  and the net result is that the beaches of Brittany have to be bulldozed of this stuff on a regular basis. And then  of course  there's climate change  and we all know about climate change. I guess the iconic figure of it is the melting of the ice in the Arctic Sea. Think about the thousands and thousands of people who died trying to find the Northwest Passage. Well  the Northwest Passage is already there. I think it's sort of funny  it's on the Siberian coast  maybe the Russians will charge tolls. The governments of the world are taking this really seriously. The military of the Arctic nations is taking it really seriously. For all the denial of climate change by government leaders  the CIA and the navies of Norway and the U.S. and Canada  whatever are busily thinking about how they will secure their territory in this inevitability from their point of view. And  of course  Arctic communities are toast. The other kinds of effects of climate change    this is coral bleaching. It's a beautiful picture  right  All that white coral. Except it's supposed to be brown. What happens is that the corals are a symbiosis  and they have these little algal cells that live inside them. And the algae give the corals sugar  and the corals give the algae nutrients and protection. But when it gets too hot  the algae can't make the sugar. The corals say   You cheated. You didn't pay your rent.  They kick them out  and then they die. Not all of them die  some of them survive  some more are surviving  but it's really bad news. To try and give you a sense of this  imagine you go camping in July somewhere in Europe or in North America  and you wake up the next morning  and you look around you  and you see that    percent of the trees  as far as you can see  have dropped their leaves and are standing there naked. And you come home  and you discover that    percent of all the trees in North America and in Europe have dropped their leaves. And then you read in the paper a few weeks later   Oh  by the way  a quarter of those died.  Well  that's what happened in the Indian Ocean during the      El Nino  an area vastly greater than the size of North America and Europe  when    percent of all the corals bleached and a quarter of them died. And then the really scary thing about all of this    the overfishing  the pollution and the climate change    is that each thing doesn't happen in a vacuum. But there are these  what we call  positive feedbacks  the synergies among them that make the whole vastly greater than the sum of the parts. And the great scientific challenge for people like me in thinking about all this  is do we know how to put Humpty Dumpty back together again  I mean  because we  at this point  we can protect it. But what does that mean  We really don't know. So what are the oceans going to be like in    or    years  Well  there won't be any fish except for minnows  and the water will be pretty dirty  and all those kinds of things and full of mercury  etc.  etc. And dead zones will get bigger and bigger and they'll start to merge  and we can imagine something like the dead zonification of the global  coastal ocean. Then you sure won't want to eat fish that were raised in it  because it would be a kind of gastronomic Russian roulette. Sometimes you have a toxic bloom  sometimes you don't. That doesn't sell. The really scary things though are the physical  chemical  oceanographic things that are happening. As the surface of the ocean gets warmer  the water is lighter when it's warmer  it becomes harder and harder to turn the ocean over. We say it becomes more strongly stratified. The consequence of that is that all those nutrients that fuel the great anchoveta fisheries  of the sardines of California or in Peru or whatever  those slow down and those fisheries collapse. And  at the same time  water from the surface  which is rich in oxygen  doesn't make it down and the ocean turns into a desert. So the question is  How are we all going to respond to this  And we can do all sorts of things to fix it  but in the final analysis  the thing we really need to fix is ourselves. It's not about the fish  it's not about the pollution  it's not about the climate change. It's about us and our greed and our need for growth and our inability to imagine a world that is different from the selfish world we live in today. So the question is  Will we respond to this or not  I would say that the future of life and the dignity of human beings depends on our doing that. Thank you.  Applause  I bring to you a message from tens of thousands of people    in the villages  in the slums  in the hinterland of the country    who have solved problems through their own genius  without any outside help. When our home minister announces a few weeks ago a war on one third of India  about     districts that he mentioned were ungovernable  he missed the point. The point that we have been stressing for the last    years  the point that people may be economically poor  but they're not poor in the mind. In other words  the minds on the margin are not the marginal minds. That is the message  which we started    years ago. And what did it start  Let me just tell you  briefly  my personal journey  which led me to come to this point. In '    '    I was in Bangladesh advising the government and the research council there how to help scientists work on the lands  on the fields of the poor people  and how to develop research technologies  which are based on the knowledge of the people. I came back in '  . I had been tremendously invigorated by the knowledge and creativity that I found in that country  which had    percent landlessness but amazing creativity. I started looking at my own work  The work that I had done for the previous    years  almost every time  had instances of knowledge that people had shared. Now  I was paid in dollars as a consultant  and I looked at my income tax return and tried to ask myself   Is there a line in my return  which shows how much of this income has gone to the people whose knowledge has made it possible  Was it because I'm brilliant that I'm getting this reward  or because of the revolution  Is it that I write very well  Is it that I articulate very well  Is it that I analyze the data very well  Is it because I'm a professor  and  therefore  I must be entitled to this reward from society   I tried to convince myself that   No  no  I have worked for the policy changes. You know  the public policy will become more responsive to the needs of the poor  and  therefore I think it's okay.  But it appeared to me that all these years that I'd been working on exploitation    exploitation by landlords  by moneylenders  by traders    gave me an insight that probably I was also an exploiter  because there was no line in my income tax return which showed this income accrued because of the brilliance of the people    those people who have shared their knowledge and good faith and trust with me    and nothing ever went back to them. So much so  that much of my work till that time was in the English language. The majority of the people from whom I learned didn't know English. So what kind of a contributor was I  I was talking about social justice  and here I was  a professional who was pursuing the most unjust act    of taking knowledge from the people  making them anonymous  getting rent from that knowledge by sharing it and doing consultancy  writing papers and publishing them in the papers  getting invited to the conferences  getting consultancies and whatever have you. So then  a dilemma rose in the mind that  if I'm also an exploiter  then this is not right  life cannot go on like that. And this was a moment of great pain and trauma because I couldn't live with it any longer. So I did a review of ethical dilemma and value conflicts and management research  wrote  read about     papers. And I came to the conclusion that while dilemma is unique  dilemma is not unique  the solution had to be unique. And one day    I don't know what happened    while coming back from the office towards home  maybe I saw a honey bee or it occurred to my mind that if I only could be like the honey bee  life would be wonderful. What the honey bee does  it pollinates  takes nectar from the flower  pollinates another flower  cross pollinates. And when it takes the nectar  the flowers don't feel shortchanged. In fact  they invite the honey bees through their colors  and the bees don't keep all the honey for themselves. These are the three guiding principles of the Honey Bee Network  that whenever we learn something from people it must be shared with them in their language. They must not remain anonymous. And I must tell you that after    years  I have not made one percent of change in the professional practice of this art. That is a great tragedy    which I'm carrying still with me and I hope that all of you will carry this with you    that the profession still legitimizes publication of knowledge of people without attributing them by making them anonymous. The research guidelines of U.S. National Academy of Sciences or Research Councils of the U.K. or of Indian Councils of Science Research do not require that whatever you learn from people  you must share back with them. We are talking about an accountable society  a society that is fair and just  and we don't even do justice in the knowledge market. And India wants to be a knowledge society. How will it be a knowledge society  So  obviously  you cannot have two principles of justice  one for yourself and one for others. It must be the same. You cannot discriminate. You cannot be in favor of your own values  which are at a distance from the values that you espouse. So  fairness to one and to the other is not divisible. Look at this picture. Can you tell me where has it been taken from  and what is it meant for  Anybody  I'm a professor  I must quiz you.  Laughter  Anybody  Any guess at all  Pardon   Audience Member  Rajasthan.  Anil Gupta  But what has it been used for  What has it been used for  Pardon  You know  you're so right. We must give him a hand  because this man knows how insensitive our government is. Look at this. This is the site of the government of India. It invites tourists to see the shame of our country. I'm so sorry to say that. Is this a beautiful picture or is it a terrible picture  It depends upon how you look at the life of the people. If this woman has to carry water on her head for miles and miles and miles  you cannot be celebrating that. We should be doing something about it. And let me tell you  with all the science and technology at our command  millions of women still carry water on their heads. And we do not ask this question. You must have taken tea in the morning. Think for a minute. The leaves of the tea  plucked from the bushes  you know what the action is  The action is  The lady picks up a few leaves  puts them in the basket on the backside. Just do it    times  you will realize the pain in this shoulder. And she does it a few thousand times every day. The rice that you ate in the lunch  and you will eat today  is transplanted by women bending in a very awkward posture  millions of them  every season  in the paddy season  when they transplant paddy with their feet in the water. And feet in the water will develop fungus  infections  and that infection pains because then other insects bite that point. And every year    .  percent of the paddy is transplanted manually. No machines have been developed. So the silence of scientists  of technologists  of public policy makers  of the change agent  drew our attention that this is not on  this is not on  this is not the way society will work. This is not what our parliament would do. You know  we have a program for employment  One hundred      million people have to be given jobs for     days by this great country. Doing what  Breaking stones  digging earth. So we asked a question to the parliament  Do poor have heads  Do poor have legs  mouth and hands  but no head  So Honey Bee Network builds upon the resource in which poor people are rich. And what has happened  An anonymous  faceless  nameless person gets in contact with the network  and then gets an identity. This is what Honey Bee Network is about. And this network grew voluntarily  continues to be voluntary  and has tried to map the minds of millions of people of our country and other parts of the world who are creative. They could be creative in terms of education  they may be creative in terms of culture  they may be creative in terms of institutions  but a lot of our work is in the field of technological creativity  the innovations  either in terms of contemporary innovations  or in terms of traditional knowledge. And it all begins with curiosity. It all begins with curiosity. This person  whom we met    and you will see it on the website  www.sristi.org    this tribal person  he had a wish. And he said   If my wish gets fulfilled     somebody was sick and he had to monitor     God  please cure him. And if you cure him  I will get my wall painted.  And this is what he got painted. Somebody was talking yesterday about Maslowian hierarchy. There could be nothing more wrong than the Maslowian model of hierarchy of needs because the poorest people in this country can get enlightenment. Kabir  Rahim  all the great Sufi saints  they were all poor people  and they had a great reason.  Applause  Please do not ever think that only after meeting your physiological needs and other needs can you be thinking about your spiritual needs or your enlightenment. Any person anywhere is capable of rising to that highest point of attainment  only by the resolve that they have in their mind that they must achieve something. Look at this. We saw it in Shodh Yatra. Every six months we walk in different parts of the country. I've walked about       kilometers in the last    years. So on the wayside we found these dung cakes  which are used as a fuel. Now  this lady  on the wall of the dung cake heap  has made a painting. That's the only space she could express her creativity. And she's so marvelous. Look at this lady  Ram Timari Devi  on a grain bin. In Champaran  we had a Shodh Yatra and we were walking in the land where Gandhiji went to hear about the tragedy  pain of indigo growers. Bhabi Mahato in Purulia and Bankura. Look at what she has done. The whole wall is her canvas. She's sitting there with a broom. Is she an artisan or an artist  Obviously she's an artist  she's a creative person. If we can create markets for these artists  we will not have to employ them for digging earth and breaking stones. They will be paid for what they are good at  not what they're bad at. Look at what Rojadeen has done. In Motihari in Champaran  there are a lot of people who sell tea on the shack and  obviously  there's a limited market for tea. Every morning you have tea  as well as coffee. So he thought  why don't I convert a pressure cooker into a coffee machine  So this is a coffee machine. Just takes a few hundred rupees. People bring their own cooker  he attaches a valve and a steam pipe  and now he gives you espresso coffee.  Laughter  Now  this is a real  affordable coffee percolator that works on gas. Look at what Sheikh Jahangir has done. A lot of poor people do not have enough grains to get ground. So this fellow is bringing a flour grinding machine on a two wheeler. If you have     grams        one kilogram  he will grind it for it for you  the flourmill will not grind such a small quantity. Please understand the problem of poor people. They have needs which have to be met efficiently in terms of energy  in terms of cost  in terms of quality. They don't want second standard  second quality outputs. But to be able to give them high quality output you need to adapt technology to their needs. And that is what Sheikh Jahangir did. But that's not enough  what he did. Look at what he did here. If you have clothes  and you don't have enough time to wash them  he brought a washing machine to your doorstep  mounted on a two wheeler. So here's a model where a two wheeler washing machine ... He is washing your clothes and drying them at your doorstep. You bring your water  you bring your soap  I wash the clothes for you. Charge    paisa  one rupee for you per lot  and a new business model can emerge. Now  what we need is  we need people who will be able to scale them up. Look at this. It looks like a beautiful photograph. But you know what it is  Can anybody guess what it is  Somebody from India would know  of course. It's a tawa. It's a hot plate made of clay. Now  what is the beauty in it  When you have a non stick pan  it costs about  maybe      rupees  five dollars  six dollars. This is less than a dollar and this is non stick  it is coated with one of these food grade materials. And the best part is that  while you use a costly non stick pan  you eat the so called Teflon or Teflon like material because after some time the stuff disappears. Where has it gone  It has gone in your stomach. It was not meant for that.  Laughter  You know  But here in this clay hot plate  it will never go into your stomach. So it is better  it is safer  it is affordable  it is energy efficient. In other words  solutions by the poor people need not be cheaper  need not be  so called  jugaad  need not be some kind of makeshift arrangement. They have to be better  they have to be more efficient  they have to be affordable. And that is what Mansukh Bhai Prajapati has done. He has designed this plate with a handle. And now with one dollar  you can afford a better alternative than the people market is offering you. This lady  she developed a herbal pesticide formulation. We filed the patent for her  the National Innovation Foundation. And who knows  Somebody will license this technology and develop marketable products  and she would get revenue. Now  let me mention one thing  I think we need a polycentric model of development  where a large number of initiatives in different parts of the country  in different parts of the world  would solve the needs of locality in a very efficient and adaptive manner. Higher the local fit  greater is the chance of scaling up. In the scaling up  there's an inherent inadequacy to match the needs of the local people  point by point  with the supply that you're making. So why are people willing to adjust with that mismatch  Things can scale up  and they have scaled up. For example  cell phones  We have     million cellphones in this country. Now  it is possible that I use only two buttons on the cellphone  only three options on the cellphone. It has     options  I'm paying for      I'm using only three but I'm willing to live with it  therefore it is scaling up. But if I had to get a match to match  obviously  I would need a different design of a cellphone. So what we're saying is that scalability should not become an enemy of sustainability. There must be a place in the world for solutions that are only relevant for a locality  and yet  one can be able to fund them. One of the greatest studies that we've been finding is that many times investors would ask this question     What is a scalable model      as if the need of a community  which is only located in a space and time and has those needs only located in those places  has no legitimate right to get them for free because it's not part of a larger scale. So either you sub optimize your needs to a larger scale or else you remain out. Now  the eminent model  the long tail model tells you that small sales of a large number of books  for example  having only a few copies sold can still be a viable model. And we must find a mechanism where people will pool in the portfolio  will invest in the portfolio  where different innovations will go to a small number of people in their localities  and yet  the overall platform of the model will become viable. Look at what he is doing. Saidullah Sahib is an amazing man. At the age of     he is linking up something very creative. Saidullah Sahib  I couldn't wait for the boat. I had to meet my love. My desperation made me an innovator. Even love needs help from technology. Innovation is the light of my wife  Noor. New inventions are the passion of my life. My technology. AG  Saidulluh Sahib is in Motihari  again in Champaran. Wonderful human being  but he stills sells  at this age  honey on a cycle to earn his livelihood  because we haven't been able to convince the water park people  the lake people  in  unclear  operations. And we have not been able to convince the fire brigade people in Mumbai    where there was a flood a few years ago and people had to walk    kilometers  wading in the water    that  look  you should have this cycle in your fire brigade office because you can then go to those lanes where your buses will not go  where your transport will not go. So we have not yet cracked the problem of making it available as a rescue device  as a vending device during the floods in eastern India  when you have to deliver things to people in different islands where they're marooned. But the idea has a merit. The idea has a merit. What has Appachan done  Appachan  unfortunately  is no more  but he has left behind a message. A very powerful message Appachan  I watch the world wake up every day. It's not that a coconut fell on my head  and I came upon this idea. With no money to fund my studies  I scaled new heights. Now  they call me the local Spiderman. My technology. AG  Many of you might not realize and believe that we have sold this product internationally    what I call a G G model  grassroots to global. And a professor in the University of Massachusetts  in the zoology department  bought this climber because she wanted to study the insect diversity of the top of the tree canopy. And this device makes it possible for her to take samples from a larger number of palms  rather than only a few  because otherwise she had to make a big platform and then climb her  unclear  would climb on that. So  you know  we are advancing the frontiers of science. Remya Jose has developed ... you can go to the YouTube and find India Innovates and then you will find these videos. Innovation by her when she was in class   th  a washing machine cum exercising machine. Mr. Kharai who is a physically challenged person  one and a half foot height  only. But he has modified a two wheeler so that he can get autonomy and freedom and flexibility. This innovation is from the slums of Rio. And this person  Mr. Ubirajara. We were talking about  my friends in Brazil  how we scale up this model in China and Brazil. And we have a very vibrant network in China  particularly  but also emerging in Brazil and other parts of the world. This stand on the front wheel  you will not find on any cycle. India and China have the largest number of cycles. But this innovation emerged in Brazil. The point is  none of us should be parochial  none of us should be so nationalistic to believe that all good ideas will come only from our country. No  we have to have the humility to learn from knowledge of economically poor people  wherever they are. And look at this whole range of cycle based innovations  cycle that's a sprayer  cycle that generates energy from the shocks on the road. I can't change the condition of the road  but I can make the cycle run faster. That is what Kanak Das has done. And in South Africa  we had taken our innovators  and many of us had gone there share with the colleagues in South Africa as to how innovation can become a means of liberation from the drudgery that people have. And this is a donkey cart which they modified. There's an axle here  of        kg  serving no purpose. Remove it  the cart needs one donkey less. This is in China. This girl needed a breathing apparatus. These three people in the village sat down and decided to think   How do we elongate the life of this girl of our village   They were not related to her  but they tried to find out   How can we use ...   They used a cycle  they put together a breathing apparatus. And this breathing apparatus now saved the life  and she's very welcome. There's a whole range of innovations that we have. A car  which runs on compressed air with six paisa per kilometer. Assam  Kanak Gogoi. And you would not find this car in U.S. or Europe  but this is available in India. Now  this lady  she used to do the winding of the yarn for Pochampally Saree. In one day         times  she had to do this winding to generate two sarees. This is what her son has done after seven years of struggle. She said   Change your profession.  He said   I can't. This is the only thing I know  but I'll invent a machine  which will solve your problem.  And this is what he did  a sewing machine in Uttar Pradesh. So  this is what SRISTI is saying   Give me a place to stand  and I will move the world.  I will just tell you that we are also doing a competition among children for creativity  a whole range of things. We have sold things all over the world  from Ethiopia to Turkey to U.S. to wherever. Products have gone to the market  a few. These are the people whose knowledge made this Herbavate cream for eczema possible. And here  a company which licensed this herbal pesticide put a photograph of the innovator on the packing so that every time a user uses it  it asks the user   You can also be an innovator. If you have an idea  send it back to us.  So  creativity counts  knowledge matters  innovations transform  incentives inspire. And incentives  not just material  but also non material incentives. Thank you. For me  this story begins about    years ago  when I was a hospice doctor at the University of Chicago. And I was taking care of people who were dying and their families in the South Side of Chicago. And I was observing what happened to people and their families over the course of their terminal illness. And in my lab  I was studying the widower effect  which is a very old idea in the social sciences  going back     years  known as  dying of a broken heart.  So  when I die  my wife's risk of death can double  for instance  in the first year. And I had gone to take care of one particular patient  a woman who was dying of dementia. And in this case  unlike this couple  she was being cared for by her daughter. And the daughter was exhausted from caring for her mother. And the daughter's husband  he also was sick from his wife's exhaustion. And I was driving home one day  and I get a phone call from the husband's friend  calling me because he was depressed about what was happening to his friend. So here I get this call from this random guy that's having an experience that's being influenced by people at some social distance. And so I suddenly realized two very simple things  First  the widowhood effect was not restricted to husbands and wives. And second  it was not restricted to pairs of people. And I started to see the world in a whole new way  like pairs of people connected to each other. And then I realized that these individuals would be connected into foursomes with other pairs of people nearby. And then  in fact  these people were embedded in other sorts of relationships  marriage and spousal and friendship and other sorts of ties. And that  in fact  these connections were vast and that we were all embedded in this broad set of connections with each other. So I started to see the world in a completely new way and I became obsessed with this. I became obsessed with how it might be that we're embedded in these social networks  and how they affect our lives. So  social networks are these intricate things of beauty  and they're so elaborate and so complex and so ubiquitous  in fact  that one has to ask what purpose they serve. Why are we embedded in social networks  I mean  how do they form  How do they operate  And how do they effect us  So my first topic with respect to this  was not death  but obesity. It had become trendy to speak about the  obesity epidemic.  And  along with my collaborator  James Fowler  we began to wonder whether obesity really was epidemic and could it spread from person to person like the four people I discussed earlier. So this is a slide of some of our initial results. It's       people in the year     . Every dot is a person. We make the dot size proportional to people's body size  so bigger dots are bigger people. In addition  if your body size  if your BMI  your body mass index  is above       if you're clinically obese    we also colored the dots yellow. So  if you look at this image  right away you might be able to see that there are clusters of obese and non obese people in the image. But the visual complexity is still very high. It's not obvious exactly what's going on. In addition  some questions are immediately raised  How much clustering is there  Is there more clustering than would be due to chance alone  How big are the clusters  How far do they reach  And  most importantly  what causes the clusters  So we did some mathematics to study the size of these clusters. This here shows  on the Y axis  the increase in the probability that a person is obese given that a social contact of theirs is obese and  on the X axis  the degrees of separation between the two people. On the far left  you see the purple line. It says that  if your friends are obese  your risk of obesity is    percent higher. And the next bar over  the  red  line  says if your friend's friends are obese  your risk of obesity is    percent higher. And then the next line over says if your friend's friend's friend  someone you probably don't even know  is obese  your risk of obesity is    percent higher. And it's only when you get to your friend's friend's friend's friends that there's no longer a relationship between that person's body size and your own body size. Well  what might be causing this clustering  There are at least three possibilities  One possibility is that  as I gain weight  it causes you to gain weight. A kind of induction  a kind of spread from person to person. Another possibility  very obvious  is homophily  or  birds of a feather flock together  here  I form my tie to you because you and I share a similar body size. And the last possibility is what is known as confounding  because it confounds our ability to figure out what's going on. And here  the idea is not that my weight gain is causing your weight gain  nor that I preferentially form a tie with you because you and I share the same body size  but rather that we share a common exposure to something  like a health club that makes us both lose weight at the same time. When we studied these data  we found evidence for all of these things  including for induction. And we found that if your friend becomes obese  it increases your risk of obesity by about    percent in the same given time period. There can be many mechanisms for this effect  One possibility is that your friends say to you something like    you know  they adopt a behavior that spreads to you    like  they say   Let's go have muffins and beer   which is a terrible combination.  Laughter  But you adopt that combination  and then you start gaining weight like them. Another more subtle possibility is that they start gaining weight  and it changes your ideas of what an acceptable body size is. Here  what's spreading from person to person is not a behavior  but rather a norm  An idea is spreading. Now  headline writers had a field day with our studies. I think the headline in The New York Times was   Are you packing it on  Blame your fat friends.   Laughter  What was interesting to us is that the European headline writers had a different take  They said   Are your friends gaining weight  Perhaps you are to blame.  And we thought this was a very interesting comment on America  and a kind of self serving   not my responsibility  kind of phenomenon. Now  I want to be very clear  We do not think our work should or could justify prejudice against people of one or another body size at all. Our next questions was  Could we actually visualize this spread  Was weight gain in one person actually spreading to weight gain in another person  And this was complicated because we needed to take into account the fact that the network structure  the architecture of the ties  was changing across time. In addition  because obesity is not a unicentric epidemic  there's not a Patient Zero of the obesity epidemic    if we find that guy  there was a spread of obesity out from him    it's a multicentric epidemic. Lots of people are doing things at the same time. And I'm about to show you a    second video animation that took me and James five years of our lives to do. So  again  every dot is a person. Every tie between them is a relationship. We're going to put this into motion now  taking daily cuts through the network for about    years. The dot sizes are going to grow  you're going to see a sea of yellow take over. You're going to see people be born and die    dots will appear and disappear    ties will form and break  marriages and divorces  friendings and defriendings. A lot of complexity  a lot is happening just in this    year period that includes the obesity epidemic. And  by the end  you're going to see clusters of obese and non obese individuals within the network. Now  when looked at this  it changed the way I see things  because this thing  this network that's changing across time  it has a memory  it moves  things flow within it  it has a kind of consistency    people can die  but it doesn't die  it still persists    and it has a kind of resilience that allows it to persist across time. And so  I came to see these kinds of social networks as living things  as living things that we could put under a kind of microscope to study and analyze and understand. And we used a variety of techniques to do this. And we started exploring all kinds of other phenomena. We looked at smoking and drinking behavior  and voting behavior  and divorce    which can spread    and altruism. And  eventually  we became interested in emotions. Now  when we have emotions  we show them. Why do we show our emotions  I mean  there would be an advantage to experiencing our emotions inside  you know  anger or happiness. But we don't just experience them  we show them. And not only do we show them  but others can read them. And  not only can they read them  but they copy them. There's emotional contagion that takes place in human populations. And so this function of emotions suggests that  in addition to any other purpose they serve  they're a kind of primitive form of communication. And that  in fact  if we really want to understand human emotions  we need to think about them in this way. Now  we're accustomed to thinking about emotions in this way  in simple  sort of  brief periods of time. So  for example  I was giving this talk recently in New York City  and I said   You know when you're on the subway and the other person across the subway car smiles at you  and you just instinctively smile back   And they looked at me and said   We don't do that in New York City.   Laughter  And I said   Everywhere else in the world  that's normal human behavior.  And so there's a very instinctive way in which we briefly transmit emotions to each other. And  in fact  emotional contagion can be broader still. Like we could have punctuated expressions of anger  as in riots. The question that we wanted to ask was  Could emotion spread  in a more sustained way than riots  across time and involve large numbers of people  not just this pair of individuals smiling at each other in the subway car  Maybe there's a kind of below the surface  quiet riot that animates us all the time. Maybe there are emotional stampedes that ripple through social networks. Maybe  in fact  emotions have a collective existence  not just an individual existence. And this is one of the first images we made to study this phenomenon. Again  a social network  but now we color the people yellow if they're happy and blue if they're sad and green in between. And if you look at this image  you can right away see clusters of happy and unhappy people  again  spreading to three degrees of separation. And you might form the intuition that the unhappy people occupy a different structural location within the network. There's a middle and an edge to this network  and the unhappy people seem to be located at the edges. So to invoke another metaphor  if you imagine social networks as a kind of vast fabric of humanity    I'm connected to you and you to her  on out endlessly into the distance    this fabric is actually like an old fashioned American quilt  and it has patches on it  happy and unhappy patches. And whether you become happy or not depends in part on whether you occupy a happy patch. So  this work with emotions  which are so fundamental  then got us to thinking about  Maybe the fundamental causes of human social networks are somehow encoded in our genes. Because human social networks  whenever they are mapped  always kind of look like this  the picture of the network. But they never look like this. Why do they not look like this  Why don't we form human social networks that look like a regular lattice  Well  the striking patterns of human social networks  their ubiquity and their apparent purpose beg questions about whether we evolved to have human social networks in the first place  and whether we evolved to form networks with a particular structure. And notice first of all    so  to understand this  though  we need to dissect network structure a little bit first    and notice that every person in this network has exactly the same structural location as every other person. But that's not the case with real networks. So  for example  here is a real network of college students at an elite northeastern university. And now I'm highlighting a few dots. If you look here at the dots  compare node B in the upper left to node D in the far right  B has four friends coming out from him and D has six friends coming out from him. And so  those two individuals have different numbers of friends. That's very obvious  we all know that. But certain other aspects of social network structure are not so obvious. Compare node B in the upper left to node A in the lower left. Now  those people both have four friends  but A's friends all know each other  and B's friends do not. So the friend of a friend of A's is  back again  a friend of A's  whereas the friend of a friend of B's is not a friend of B's  but is farther away in the network. This is known as transitivity in networks. And  finally  compare nodes C and D  C and D both have six friends. If you talk to them  and you said   What is your social life like   they would say   I've got six friends. That's my social experience.  But now we  with a bird's eye view looking at this network  can see that they occupy very different social worlds. And I can cultivate that intuition in you by just asking you  Who would you rather be if a deadly germ was spreading through the network  Would you rather be C or D  You'd rather be D  on the edge of the network. And now who would you rather be if a juicy piece of gossip    not about you    was spreading through the network   Laughter  Now  you would rather be C. So different structural locations have different implications for your life. And  in fact  when we did some experiments looking at this  what we found is that    percent of the variation in how many friends you have is explained by your genes. And this is not surprising. We know that some people are born shy and some are born gregarious. That's obvious. But we also found some non obvious things. For instance     percent in the variation in whether your friends know each other is attributable to your genes. Whether your friends know each other has not just to do with their genes  but with yours. And we think the reason for this is that some people like to introduce their friends to each other    you know who you are    and others of you keep them apart and don't introduce your friends to each other. And so some people knit together the networks around them  creating a kind of dense web of ties in which they're comfortably embedded. And finally  we even found that    percent of the variation in whether or not people are in the middle or on the edge of the network can also be attributed to their genes. So whether you find yourself in the middle or on the edge is also partially heritable. Now  what is the point of this  How does this help us understand  How does this help us figure out some of the problems that are affecting us these days  Well  the argument I'd like to make is that networks have value. They are a kind of social capital. New properties emerge because of our embeddedness in social networks  and these properties inhere in the structure of the networks  not just in the individuals within them. So think about these two common objects. They're both made of carbon  and yet one of them has carbon atoms in it that are arranged in one particular way    on the left    and you get graphite  which is soft and dark. But if you take the same carbon atoms and interconnect them a different way  you get diamond  which is clear and hard. And those properties of softness and hardness and darkness and clearness do not reside in the carbon atoms  they reside in the interconnections between the carbon atoms  or at least arise because of the interconnections between the carbon atoms. So  similarly  the pattern of connections among people confers upon the groups of people different properties. It is the ties between people that makes the whole greater than the sum of its parts. And so it is not just what's happening to these people    whether they're losing weight or gaining weight  or becoming rich or becoming poor  or becoming happy or not becoming happy    that affects us  it's also the actual architecture of the ties around us. Our experience of the world depends on the actual structure of the networks in which we're residing and on all the kinds of things that ripple and flow through the network. Now  the reason  I think  that this is the case is that human beings assemble themselves and form a kind of superorganism. Now  a superorganism is a collection of individuals which show or evince behaviors or phenomena that are not reducible to the study of individuals and that must be understood by reference to  and by studying  the collective. Like  for example  a hive of bees that's finding a new nesting site  or a flock of birds that's evading a predator  or a flock of birds that's able to pool its wisdom and navigate and find a tiny speck of an island in the middle of the Pacific  or a pack of wolves that's able to bring down larger prey. Superorganisms have properties that cannot be understood just by studying the individuals. I think understanding social networks and how they form and operate can help us understand not just health and emotions but all kinds of other phenomena    like crime  and warfare  and economic phenomena like bank runs and market crashes and the adoption of innovation and the spread of product adoption. Now  look at this. I think we form social networks because the benefits of a connected life outweigh the costs. If I was always violent towards you or gave you misinformation or made you sad or infected you with deadly germs  you would cut the ties to me  and the network would disintegrate. So the spread of good and valuable things is required to sustain and nourish social networks. Similarly  social networks are required for the spread of good and valuable things  like love and kindness and happiness and altruism and ideas. I think  in fact  that if we realized how valuable social networks are  we'd spend a lot more time nourishing them and sustaining them  because I think social networks are fundamentally related to goodness. And what I think the world needs now is more connections. Thank you. We invent. My company invents all kinds of new technology in lots of different areas. And we do that for a couple of reasons. We invent for fun    invention is a lot of fun to do    and we also invent for profit. The two are related because the profit actually takes long enough that if it isn't fun  you wouldn't have the time to do it. So we do this fun and profit oriented inventing for most of what we do  but we also have a program where we invent for humanity    where we take some of our best inventors  and we say   Are there problems where we have a good idea for solving a problem the world has      and to solve it in the way we try to solve problems  which is with dramatic  crazy  out of the box solutions. Bill Gates is one of those smartest guys of ours that work on these problems and he also funds this work  so thank you. So I'm going to briefly discuss a couple of problems that we have and a couple of problems where we've got some solutions underway. Vaccination is one of the key techniques in public health  a fantastic thing. But in the developing world a lot of vaccines spoil before they're administered  and that's because they need to be kept cold. Almost all vaccines need to be kept at refrigerator temperatures. They go bad very quickly if you don't  and if you don't have stable power grid  this doesn't happen  so kids die. It's not just the loss of the vaccine that matters  it's the fact that those kids don't get vaccinated. This is one of the ways that vaccines are carried  These are Styrofoam chests. These are being carried by people  but they're also put on the backs of pickup trucks. We've got a different solution. Now  one of these Styrofoam chests will last for about four hours with ice in it. And we thought  well  that's not really good enough. So we made this thing. This lasts six months with no power  absolutely zero power  because it loses less than a half a watt. Now  this is our second generations prototype. The third generation prototype is  right now  in Uganda being tested. Now  the reason we were able to come up with this is two key ideas  One is that this is similar to a cryogenic Dewar  something you'd keep liquid nitrogen or liquid helium in. They have incredible insulation  so let's put some incredible insulation here. The other idea is kind of interesting  which is  you can't reach inside anymore. Because if you open it up and reach inside  you'd let the heat in  the game would be over. So the inside of this thing actually looks like a Coke machine. It vends out little individual vials. So a simple idea  which we hope is going to change the way vaccines are distributed in Africa and around the world. We'll move on to malaria. Malaria is one of the great public health problems. Esther Duflo talked a little bit about this. Two hundred million people a year. Every    seconds a child in Africa dies     will die during my talk. And there's no way for us here in this country to grasp really what that means to the people involved. Another comment of Esther's was that we react when there's a tragedy like Haiti  but that tragedy is ongoing. So what can we do about it  Well  there are a lot of things people have tried for many years for solving malaria. You can spray  the problem is there are environmental issues. You can try to treat people and create awareness. That's great  except the places that have malaria really bad  they don't have health care systems. A vaccine would be a terrific thing  only they don't work yet. People have tried for a long time. There are a couple of interesting candidates. It's a very difficult thing to make a vaccine for. You can distribute bed nets  and bed nets are very effective if you use them. You don't always use them for that. People fish with them. They don't always get to everyone. And bed nets have an effect on the epidemic  but you're never going to make it extinct with bed nets. Now  malaria is an incredibly complicated disease. We could spend hours going over this. It's got this sort of soap opera like lifestyle  they have sex  they burrow into your liver  they tunnel into your blood cells ... it's an incredibly complicated disease  but that's actually one of the things we find interesting about it and why we work on malaria  There's a lot of potential ways in. One of those ways might be better diagnosis. So we hope this year to prototype each of these devices. One does an automatic malaria diagnosis in the same way that a diabetic's glucose meter works  You take a drop of blood  you put it in there and it automatically tells you. Today  you need to do a complicated laboratory procedure  create a bunch of microscope slides and have a trained person examine it. The other thing is  you know  it would be even better if you didn't have to draw the blood. And if you look through the eye  or you look at the vessels on the white of the eye  in fact  you may be able to do this directly  without drawing any blood at all  or through your nail beds. Because if you actually look through your fingernails  you can see blood vessels  and once you see blood vessels  we think we can see the malaria. We can see it because of this molecule called hemozoin. It's produced by the malaria parasite and it's a very interesting crystalline substance. Interesting  anyway  if you're a solid state physicist. There's a lot of cool stuff we can do with it. This is our femtosecond laser lab. So this creates pulses of light that last a femtosecond. That's really  really  really short. This is a pulse of light that's only about one wavelength of light long  so it's a whole bunch of photons all coming and hitting simultaneously. It creates a very high peak power and it lets you do all kinds of interesting things  in particular  it lets you find hemozoin. So here's an image of red blood cells  and now we can actually map where the hemozoin and where the malaria parasites are inside those red blood cells. And using both this technique and other optical techniques  we think we can make those diagnostics. We also have another hemozoin oriented therapy for malaria  a way  in acute cases  to actually take the malaria parasite and filter it out of the blood system. Sort of like doing dialysis  but for relieving the parasite load. This is our thousand core supercomputer. We're kind of software guys  and so nearly any problem that you pose  we like to try to solve with some software. One of the problems that you have if you're trying to eradicate malaria or reduce it is you don't know what's the most effective thing to do. Okay  we heard about bed nets earlier. You spend a certain amount per bed net. Or you could spray. You can give drug administration. There's all these different interventions but they have different kinds of effectiveness. How can you tell  So we've created  using our supercomputer  the world's best computer model of malaria  which we'll show you now. We picked Madagascar. We have every road  every village  every  almost  square inch of Madagascar. We have all of the precipitation data and the temperature data. That's very important because the humidity and precipitation tell you whether you've got standing pools of water for the mosquitoes to breed. So that sets the stage on which you do this. You then have to introduce the mosquitoes  and you have to model that and how they come and go. Ultimately  it gives you this. This is malaria spreading across Madagascar. And this is this latter part of the rainy season. We're going to the dry season now. It nearly goes away in the dry season  because there's no place for the mosquitoes to breed. And then  of course  the next year it comes roaring back. By doing these kinds of simulations  we want to eradicate or control malaria thousands of times in software before we actually have to do it in real life  to be able to simulate both the economic trade offs    how many bed nets versus how much spraying     or the social trade offs    what happens if unrest breaks out  We also try to study our foe. This is a high speed camera view of a mosquito. And  in a moment  we're going to see a view of the airflow. Here  we're trying to visualize the airflow around the wings of the mosquito with little particles we're illuminating with a laser. By understanding how mosquitoes fly  we hope to understand how to make them not fly. Now  one of the ways you can make them not fly is with DDT. This is a real ad. This is one of those things you just can't make up. Once upon a time  this was the primary technique  and  in fact  many countries got rid of malaria through DDT. The United States did. In       there were         cases a year of malaria in the United States  but DDT and a massive public health effort managed to squelch it. So we thought   Well  we've done all these things that are focused on the Plasmodium  the parasite involved. What can we do to the mosquito  Well  let's try to kill it with consumer electronics.  Now  that sounds silly  but each of these devices has something interesting in it that maybe you could use. Your Blu ray player has a very cheap blue laser. Your laser printer has a mirror galvanometer that's used to steer a laser beam very accurately  that's what makes those little dots on the page. And  of course  there's signal processing and digital cameras. So what if we could put all that together to shoot them out of the sky with lasers  Now  in our company  this is what we call  the pinky suck moment.  What if we could do that  Now  just suspend disbelief for a moment  and let's think of what could happen if we could do that. Well  we could protect very high value targets like clinics. Clinics are full of people that have malaria. They're sick  and so they're less able to defend themselves from the mosquitoes. You really want to protect them. Of course  if you do that  you could also protect your backyard. And farmers could protect their crops that they want to sell to Whole Foods because our photons are     percent organic.  Laughter  They're completely natural. Now  it actually gets better than this. You could  if you're really smart  you could shine a nonlethal laser on the bug before you zap it  and you could listen to the wing beat frequency and you could measure the size. And then you could decide   Is this an insect I want to kill  or an insect I don't want to kill   Moore's law made computing cheap  so cheap we can weigh the life of an individual insect and decide thumbs up or thumbs down.  Laughter  Now  it turns out we only kill the female mosquitoes. They're the only ones that are dangerous. Mosquitoes only drink blood to lay eggs. Mosquitoes actually live ... their day to day nutrition comes from nectar  from flowers    in fact  in the lab  we feed ours raisins    but the female needs the blood meal. So  this sounds really crazy  right  Would you like to see it  Audience  Yeah  Nathan Myhrvold  Okay  so our legal department prepared a disclaimer  and here it is. Now  after thinking about this a little bit we thought  you know  it probably would be simpler to do this with a nonlethal laser. So  Eric Johanson  who built the device  actually  with parts from eBay  and Pablos Holman over here  he's got mosquitoes in the tank. We have the device over here. And we're going to show you  instead of the kill laser  which will be a very brief  instantaneous pulse  we're going to have a green laser pointer that's going to stay on the mosquito for  actually  quite a long period of time  otherwise  you can't see it very well. Take it away Eric. Eric Johanson  What we have here is a tank on the other side of the stage. And we have ... this computer screen can actually see the mosquitoes as they fly around. And Pablos  if he stirs up our mosquitoes a little bit we can see them flying around. Now  that's a fairly straightforward image processing routine  and let me show you how it works. Here you can see that the insects are being tracked as they're flying around  which is kind of fun. Next we can actually light them up with a laser.  Laughter  Now  this is a low powered laser  and we can actually pick up a wing beat frequency. So you may be able to hear some mosquitoes flying around. NM  That's a mosquito wing beat you're hearing. EJ  Finally  let's see what this looks like. There you can see mosquitoes as they fly around  being lit up. This is slowed way down so that you have an opportunity to see what's happening. Here we have it running at high speed mode. So this system that was built for TED is here to illustrate that it is technically possible to actually deploy a system like this  and we're looking very hard at how to make it highly cost effective to use in places like Africa and other parts of the world. NM  So it wouldn't be any fun to show you that without showing you what actually happens when we hit 'em. This is very satisfying. This is one of the first ones we did. The energy's a little bit high here. We'll loop around here in just a second  and you'll see another one. Here's another one. Bang. An interesting thing is  we kill them all the time  we've never actually gotten the wings to shut off in midair. The wing motor is very resilient. I mean  here we're blowing wings off but the wing motor keeps all the way down. So  that's what I have. Thanks very much. I'm going to tell you two things today  One is what we have lost  and two  a way to bring it back. And let me start with this. This is my baseline  This is the Mediterranean coast with no fish  bare rock and lots of sea urchins that like to eat the algae. Something like this is what I first saw when I jumped in the water for the first time in the Mediterranean coast off Spain. Now  if an alien came to earth    let's call him Joe    what would Joe see  If Joe jumped in a coral reef  there are many things the alien could see. Very unlikely  Joe would jump on a pristine coral reef  a virgin coral reef with lots of coral  sharks  crocodiles  manatees  groupers  turtles  etc. So  probably  what Joe would see would be in this part  in the greenish part of the picture. Here we have the extreme with dead corals  microbial soup and jellyfish. And where the diver is  this is probably where most of the reefs of the world are now  with very few corals  algae overgrowing the corals  lots of bacteria  and where the large animals are gone. And this is what most marine scientists have seen too. This is their baseline. This is what they think is natural because we started modern science with scuba diving long after we started degrading marine ecosystems. So I'm going to get us all on a time machine  and we're going to the left  we're going to go back to the past to see what the ocean was like. And let's start with this time machine  the Line Islands  where we have conducted a series of National Geographic expeditions. This sea is an archipelago belonging to Kiribati that spans across the equator and it has several uninhabited  unfished  pristine islands and a few inhabited islands. So let's start with the first one  Christmas Island  over       people. Most of the reefs are dead  most of the corals are dead    overgrown by algae    and most of the fish are smaller than the pencils we use to count them. We did     hours of diving here in     . We didn't see a single shark. This is the place that Captain Cook discovered in      and he described a huge abundance of sharks biting the rudders and the oars of their small boats while they were going ashore. Let's move the dial a little bit to the past. Fanning Island        people. The corals are doing better here. Lots of small fish. This is what many divers would consider paradise. This is where you can see most of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. And many people think this is really  really beautiful  if this is your baseline. If we go back to a place like Palmyra Atoll  where I was with Jeremy Jackson a few years ago  the corals are doing better and there are sharks. You can see sharks in every single dive. And this is something that is very unusual in today's coral reefs. But then  if we shift the dial          years back  then we get to the places where the corals are absolutely healthy and gorgeous  forming spectacular structures  and where the predators are the most conspicuous thing  where you see between    and    sharks per dive. What have we learned from these places  This is what we thought was natural. This is what we call the biomass pyramid. If we get all of the fish of a coral reef together and weigh them  this is what we would expect. Most of the biomass is low on the food chain  the herbivores  the parrotfish  the surgeonfish that eat the algae. Then the plankton feeders  these little damselfish  the little animals floating in the water. And then we have a lower biomass of carnivores  and a lower biomass of top head  or the sharks  the large snappers  the large groupers. But this is a consequence. This view of the world is a consequence of having studied degraded reefs. When we went to pristine reefs  we realized that the natural world was upside down  this pyramid was inverted. The top head does account for most of the biomass  in some places up to    percent  like Kingman Reef  which is now protected. The good news is that  in addition to having more predators  there's more of everything. The size of these boxes is bigger. We have more sharks  more biomass of snappers  more biomass of herbivores  too  like these parrot fish that are like marine goats. They clean the reef  everything that grows enough to be seen  they eat  and they keep the reef clean and allow the corals to replenish. Not only do these places    these ancient  pristine places    have lots of fish  but they also have other important components of the ecosystem like the giant clams  pavements of giant clams in the lagoons  up to        per square meter. These have disappeared from every inhabited reef in the world  and they filter the water  they keep the water clean from microbes and pathogens. But still  now we have global warming. If we don't have fishing because these reefs are protected by law or their remoteness  this is great. But the water gets warmer for too long and the corals die. So how are these fish  these predators going to help  Well  what we have seen is that in this particular area during El Nino  year '    '    the water was too warm for too long  and many corals bleached and many died. In Christmas  where the food web is really trimmed down  where the large animals are gone  the corals have not recovered. In Fanning Island  the corals are not recovered. But you see here a big table coral that died and collapsed. And the fish have grazed the algae  so the turf of algae is a little lower. Then you go to Palmyra Atoll that has more biomass of herbivores  and the dead corals are clean  and the corals are coming back. And when you go to the pristine side  did this ever bleach  These places bleached too  but they recovered faster. The more intact  the more complete   and  the more complex your food web  the higher the resilience   and  the more likely that the system is going to recover from the short term impacts of warming events. And that's good news  so we need to recover that structure. We need to make sure that all of the pieces of the ecosystem are there so the ecosystem can adapt to the effects of global warming. So if we have to reset the baseline  if we have to push the ecosystem back to the left  how can we do it  Well  there are several ways. One very clear way is the marine protected areas  especially no take reserves that we set aside to allow for the recovery for marine life. And let me go back to that image of the Mediterranean. This was my baseline. This is what I saw when I was a kid. And at the same time I was watching Jacques Cousteau's shows on TV  with all this richness and abundance and diversity. And I thought that this richness belonged to tropical seas  and that the Mediterranean was a naturally poor sea. But  little did I know  until I jumped for the first time in a marine reserve. And this is what I saw  lots of fish. After a few years  between five and seven years  fish come back  they eat the urchins  and then the algae grow again. So you have this little algal forest  and in the size of a laptop you can find more than     species of algae  mostly microscopic fit hundreds of species of little animals that then feed the fish  so that the system recovers. And this particular place  the Medes Islands Marine Reserve  is only    hectares  and it brings   million euros to the local economy     times more than fishing  and it represents    percent of all the tourist revenue. So these places not only help the ecosystem but also help the people who can benefit from the ecosystem. So let me just give you a summary of what no take reserves do. These places  when we protect them  if we compare them to unprotected areas nearby  this is what happens. The number of species increases    percent  so if you have       species you would expect     more in a marine reserve. This is very substantial. The size of organisms increases a third  so your fish are now this big. The abundance  how many fish you have per square meter  increases almost     percent. And the biomass    this is the most spectacular change     .  times greater biomass on average  just after five to seven years. In some places up to    times larger biomass inside the reserves. So we have all these things inside the reserve that grow  and what do they do  They reproduce. That's population biology    . If you don't kill the fish  they take a longer time to die  they grow larger and they reproduce a lot. And same thing for invertebrates. This is the example. These are egg cases laid by a snail off the coast of Chile  and this is how many eggs they lay on the bottom. Outside the reserve  you cannot even detect this. One point three million eggs per square meter inside the marine reserve where these snails are very abundant. So these organisms reproduce  the little larvae juveniles spill over  they all spill over  and then people can benefit from them outside too. This is in the Bahamas  Nassau grouper. Huge abundance of groupers inside the reserve  and the closer you get to the reserve  the more fish you have. So the fishermen are catching more. You can see where the limits of the reserve are because you see the boats lined up. So there is spill over  there are benefits beyond the boundaries of these reserves that help people around them  while at the same time the reserve is protecting the entire habitat. It is building resilience. So what we have now    or a world without reserves    is like a debit account where we withdraw all the time and we never make any deposit. Reserves are like savings accounts. We have this principal that we don't touch  that produces returns  social  economic and ecological. And if we think about the increase of biomass inside the reserves  this is like compound interest. Two examples  again  of how these reserves can benefit people. This is how much fishermen get everyday in Kenya  fishing over a series of years  in a place where there is no protection  it's a free for all. Once the most degrading fishing gear  seine nets  were removed  the fishermen were catching more. If you fish less  you're actually catching more. But if we add the no take reserve on top of that  the fishermen are still making more money by fishing less around an area that is protected. Another example  Nassau groupers in Belize in the Mesoamerican Reef. This is grouper sex  and the groupers aggregate around the full moons of December and January for a week. They used to aggregate up to the tens of thousands         groupers about this big in one hectare  in one aggregation. Fishermen knew about these things  they caught them  and they depleted them. When I went there for the first time in       there were only       groupers left. And the fishermen were authorized to catch    percent of the entire spawning population every year. So we did a simple analysis  and it doesn't take rocket science to figure out that  if you take    percent every year  your fishery is going to collapse very quickly. And with the fishery  the entire reproductive ability of the species goes extinct. It happened in many places around the Caribbean. And they would make       dollars per year  total  for the entire fishery  several fishing boats. Now  if you do an economic analysis and project what would happen if the fish were not cut  if we brought just    divers one month per year  the revenue would be more than    times higher and that would be sustainable over time. So how much of this do we have  If this is so good  if this is such a no brainer  how much of this do we have  And you already heard that less than one percent of the ocean's protected. We're getting closer to one percent now  thanks to the protections of the Chagos Archipelago  and only a fraction of this is fully protected from fishing. Scientific studies recommend that at least    percent of the ocean should be protected. The estimated range is between    and    percent for a series of goals of biodiversity and fishery enhancement and resilience. Now  is this possible  People would ask  How much would that cost  Well  let's think about how much we are paying now to subsidize fishing     billion dollars per year. Many of these subsidies go to destructive fishing practices. Well  there are a couple estimates of how much it would cost to create a network of protected areas covering    percent of the ocean that would be only a fraction of what we are now paying  the government hands out to a fishery that is collapsing. People are losing their jobs because the fisheries are collapsing. A creation of a network of reserves would provide direct employment for more than a million people plus all the secondary jobs and all the secondary benefits. So how can we do that  If it's so clear that these savings accounts are good for the environment and for people  why don't we have        percent of the ocean  And how can we reach that goal  Well  there are two ways of getting there. The trivial solution is to create really large protected areas like the Chagos Archipelago. The problem is that we can create these large reserves only in places where there are no people  where there is no social conflict  where the political cost is really low and the economic cost is also low. And a few of us  a few organizations in this room and elsewhere are working on this. But what about the rest of the coast of the world  where people live and make a living out of fishing  Well  there are three main reasons why we don't have tens of thousands of small reserves  The first one is that people have no idea what marine reserves do  and fishermen tend to be really  really defensive when it comes to regulating or closing an area  even if it's small. Second  the governance is not right because most coastal communities around the world don't have the authority to monitor the resources to create the reserve and enforce it. It's a top down hierarchical structure where people wait for government agents to come and this is not effective. And the government doesn't have enough resources. Which takes us to the third reason  why we don't have many more reserves  is that the funding models have been wrong. NGOs and governments spend a lot of time and energy and resources in a few small areas  usually. So marine conservation and coastal protection has become a sink for government or philanthropic money  and this is not sustainable. So the solutions are just fixing these three issues. First  we need to develop a global awareness campaign to inspire local communities and governments to create no take reserves that are better than what we have now. It's the savings accounts versus the debit accounts with no deposits. Second  we need to redesign our governance so conservation efforts can be decentralized  so conservation efforts don't depend on work from NGOs or from government agencies and can be created by the local communities  like it happens in the Philippines and a few other places. And third  and very important  we need to develop new business models. The philanthropy sink as the only way to create reserves is not sustainable. We really need to develop models  business models  where coastal conservation is an investment  because we already know that these marine reserves provide social  ecological and economic benefits. And I'd like to finish with one thought  which is that no one organization alone is going to save the ocean. There has been a lot of competition in the past  and we need to develop a new model of partnership  truly collaborative  where we are looking for complementing  not substituting. The stakes are just too high to continue the way we are going. So let's do that. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Thank you Enric. Enric Sala  Thank you. CA  That was a masterful job of pulling things together. First of all  your pyramid  your inverted pyramid  showing    percent biomass in the predators  that seems impossible. How could    percent survive on    percent  ES  Well  imagine that you have two gears of a watch  a big one and a small one. The big one is moving very slowly  and the small one is moving fast. That's basically it. The animals at the lower parts of the food chain  they reproduce very fast  they grow really fast  they produce millions of eggs. Up there  you have sharks and large fish that live        years. They reproduce very slowly  they have a slow metabolism  and  basically  they just maintain their biomass. So  basically  the production surplus of these guys down there is enough to maintain this biomass that is not moving. They are like capacitors of the system. CA  That's very fascinating. So  really  our picture of a food pyramid is just    we have to change that completely. ES  At least in the seas. What we found in coral reefs is that the inverted pyramid is the equivalent of the Serengeti  with five lions per wildebeest. And on land  this cannot work. But at least on coral reefs are systems where there is a bottom component with structure. We think this is universal. But we have started studying pristine reefs only very recently. CA  So the numbers you presented really are astonishing. You're saying we're spending    billion dollars now on subsidies. It would only cost    billion to set up    percent of the ocean as marine protected areas that actually give new living choices to the fishermen as well. If the world was a smarter place  we could solve this problem for negative    billion dollars. We've got    billion to spend on health care or something. ES  And then we have the under performance of fisheries that is    billion dollars. So again  one of the big solutions is have the World Trade Organization shifting the subsidies to sustainable practices. CA  Okay  so there's a lot of examples that I'm hearing out there about ending this subsidies madness. So thank you for those numbers. The last one's a personal question. A lot of the experience of people here who've been in the oceans for a long time has just been seeing this degradation  the places they saw that were beautiful getting worse  depressing. Talk to me about the feeling that you must have experienced of going to these pristine areas and seeing things coming back. ES  It is a spiritual experience. We go there to try to understand the ecosystems  to try to measure or count fish and sharks and see how these places are different from the places we know. But the best feeling is this biophilia that E.O. Wilson talks about  where humans have this sense of awe and wonder in front of untamed nature  of raw nature. And there  only there  you really feel that you are part of a larger thing or of a larger global ecosystem. And if it were not for these places that show hope  I don't think I could continue doing this job. It would be just too depressing. CA  Well  Enric  thank you so much for sharing some of that spiritual experience with us all. Thank you. ES  Thank you very much. Can I ask you to please recall a time when you really loved something    a movie  an album  a song or a book    and you recommended it wholeheartedly to someone you also really liked  and you anticipated that reaction  you waited for it  and it came back  and the person hated it  So  by way of introduction  that is the exact same state in which I spent every working day of the last six years.  Laughter  I teach high school math. I sell a product to a market that doesn't want it  but is forced by law to buy it. I mean  it's just a losing proposition. So there's a useful stereotype about students that I see  a useful stereotype about you all. I could give you guys an algebra two final exam  and I would expect no higher than a    percent pass rate. And both of these facts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call math education in the U.S. today. To start with  I'd like to break math down into two categories. One is computation  this is the stuff you've forgotten. For example  factoring quadratics with leading coefficients greater than one. This stuff is also really easy to relearn  provided you have a really strong grounding in reasoning. Math reasoning    we'll call it the application of math processes to the world around us    this is hard to teach. This is what we would love students to retain  even if they don't go into mathematical fields. This is also something that  the way we teach it in the U.S. all but ensures they won't retain it. So  I'd like to talk about why that is  why that's such a calamity for society  what we can do about it and  to close with  why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher. So first  five symptoms that you're doing math reasoning wrong in your classroom. One is a lack of initiative  your students don't self start. You finish your lecture block and immediately you have five hands going up asking you to re explain the entire thing at their desks. Students lack perseverance. They lack retention  you find yourself re explaining concepts three months later  wholesale. There's an aversion to word problems  which describes    percent of my students. And then the other one percent is eagerly looking for the formula to apply in that situation. This is really destructive. David Milch  creator of  Deadwood  and other amazing TV shows  has a really good description for this. He swore off creating contemporary drama  shows set in the present day  because he saw that when people fill their mind with four hours a day of  for example   Two and a Half Men   no disrespect  it shapes the neural pathways  he said  in such a way that they expect simple problems. He called it   an impatience with irresolution.  You're impatient with things that don't resolve quickly. You expect sitcom sized problems that wrap up in    minutes  three commercial breaks and a laugh track. And I'll put it to all of you  what you already know  that no problem worth solving is that simple. I am very concerned about this because I'm going to retire in a world that my students will run. I'm doing bad things to my own future and well being when I teach this way. I'm here to tell you that the way our textbooks    particularly mass adopted textbooks    teach math reasoning and patient problem solving  it's functionally equivalent to turning on  Two and a Half Men  and calling it a day. In all seriousness. Here's an example from a physics textbook. It applies equally to math. Notice  first of all here  that you have exactly three pieces of information there  each of which will figure into a formula somewhere  eventually  which the student will then compute. I believe in real life. And ask yourself  what problem have you solved  ever  that was worth solving where you knew all of the given information in advance  where you didn't have a surplus of information and you had to filter it out  or you didn't have sufficient information and had to go find some. I'm sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that. And the textbook  I think  knows how it's hamstringing students because  watch this  this is the practice problem set. When it comes time to do the actual problem set  we have problems like this right here where we're just swapping out numbers and tweaking the context a little bit. And if the student still doesn't recognize the stamp this was molded from  it helpfully explains to you what sample problem you can return to to find the formula. You could literally  I mean this  pass this particular unit without knowing any physics  just knowing how to decode a textbook. That's a shame. So I can diagnose the problem a little more specifically in math. Here's a really cool problem. I like this. It's about defining steepness and slope using a ski lift. But what you have here is actually four separate layers  and I'm curious which of you can see the four separate layers and  particularly  how when they're compressed together and presented to the student all at once  how that creates this impatient problem solving. I'll define them here  You have the visual. You also have the mathematical structure  talking about grids  measurements  labels  points  axes  that sort of thing. You have substeps  which all lead to what we really want to talk about  which section is the steepest. So I hope you can see. I really hope you can see how what we're doing here is taking a compelling question  a compelling answer  but we're paving a smooth  straight path from one to the other and congratulating our students for how well they can step over the small cracks in the way. That's all we're doing here. So I want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way and build them up with students  we can have everything we're looking for in terms of patient problem solving. So right here I start with the visual  and I immediately ask the question  Which section is the steepest  And this starts conversation because the visual is created in such a way where you can defend two answers. So you get people arguing against each other  friend versus friend  in pairs  journaling  whatever. And then eventually we realize it's getting annoying to talk about the skier in the lower left hand side of the screen or the skier just above the mid line. And we realize how great would it be if we just had some A  B  C and D labels to talk about them more easily. And then as we start to define what does steepness mean  we realize it would be nice to have some measurements to really narrow it down  specifically what that means. And then and only then  we throw down that mathematical structure. The math serves the conversation  the conversation doesn't serve the math. And at that point  I'll put it to you that nine out of    classes are good to go on the whole slope  steepness thing. But if you need to  your students can then develop those substeps together. Do you guys see how this  right here  compared to that    which one creates that patient problem solving  that math reasoning  It's been obvious in my practice  to me. And I'll yield the floor here for a second to Einstein  who  I believe  has paid his dues. He talked about the formulation of a problem being so incredibly important  and yet in my practice  in the U.S. here  we just give problems to students  we don't involve them in the formulation of the problem. So    percent of what I do with my five hours of prep time per week is to take fairly compelling elements of problems like this from my textbook and rebuild them in a way that supports math reasoning and patient problem solving. And here's how it works. I like this question. It's about a water tank. The question is  How long will it take you to fill it up  First things first  we eliminate all the substeps. Students have to develop those  they have to formulate those. And then notice that all the information written on there is stuff you'll need. None of it's a distractor  so we lose that. Students need to decide   All right  well  does the height matter  Does the side of it matter  Does the color of the valve matter  What matters here   Such an underrepresented question in math curriculum. So now we have a water tank. How long will it take you to fill it up  And that's it. And because this is the   st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms  not in terms of line art or clip art that you so often see in textbooks  we go out and we take a picture of it. So now we have the real deal. How long will it take it to fill it up  And then even better is we take a video  a video of someone filling it up. And it's filling up slowly  agonizingly slowly. It's tedious. Students are looking at their watches  rolling their eyes  and they're all wondering at some point or another   Man  how long is it going to take to fill up   That's how you know you've baited the hook  right  And that question  off this right here  is really fun for me because  like the intro  I teach kids    because of my inexperience    I teach the kids that are the most remedial  all right  And I've got kids who will not join a conversation about math because someone else has the formula  someone else knows how to work the formula better than me  so I won't talk about it. But here  every student is on a level playing field of intuition. Everyone's filled something up with water before  so I get kids answering the question   How long will it take   I've got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated joining the conversation. We put names on the board  attach them to guesses  and kids have bought in here. And then we follow the process I've described. And the best part here  or one of the better parts is that we don't get our answer from the answer key in the back of the teacher's edition. We  instead  just watch the end of the movie. And that's terrifying  because the theoretical models that always work out in the answer key in the back of a teacher's edition  that's great  but it's scary to talk about sources of error when the theoretical does not match up with the practical. But those conversations have been so valuable  among the most valuable. So I'm here to report some really fun games with students who come pre installed with these viruses day one of the class. These are the kids who now  one semester in  I can put something on the board  totally new  totally foreign  and they'll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year  which is just so fun. We're no longer averse to word problems  because we've redefined what a word problem is. We're no longer intimidated by math  because we're slowly redefining what math is. This has been a lot of fun. I encourage math teachers I talk to to use multimedia  because it brings the real world into your classroom in high resolution and full color  to encourage student intuition for that level playing field  to ask the shortest question you possibly can and let those more specific questions come out in conversation  to let students build the problem  because Einstein said so  and to finally  in total  just be less helpful  because the textbook is helping you in all the wrong ways  It's buying you out of your obligation  for patient problem solving and math reasoning  to be less helpful. And why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now is because we have the tools to create this high quality curriculum in our front pocket. It's ubiquitous and fairly cheap  and the tools to distribute it freely under open licenses has also never been cheaper or more ubiquitous. I put a video series on my blog not so long ago and it got       views in two weeks. I get emails still from teachers in countries I've never visited saying   Wow  yeah. We had a good conversation about that. Oh  and by the way  here's how I made your stuff better   which  wow. I put this problem on my blog recently  In a grocery store  which line do you get into  the one that has one cart and    items or the line with four carts and three  five  two and one items. And the linear modeling involved in that was some good stuff for my classroom  but it eventually got me on  Good Morning America  a few weeks later  which is just bizarre  right  And from all of this  I can only conclude that people  not just students  are really hungry for this. Math makes sense of the world. Math is the vocabulary for your own intuition. So I just really encourage you  whatever your stake is in education    whether you're a student  parent  teacher  policy maker  whatever    insist on better math curriculum. We need more patient problem solvers. Thank you.  Applause  I have a daughter  Mulan. And when she was eight  last year  she was doing a report for school or she had some homework about frogs. And we were at this restaurant  and she said   So  basically  frogs lay eggs and the eggs turn into tadpoles  and tadpoles turn into frogs.  And I said   Yeah. You know  I'm not really up on my frog reproduction that much. It's the females  I think  that lay the eggs  and then the males fertilize them. And then they become tadpoles and frogs.  And she says   What  Only the females have eggs   And I said   Yeah.  And she goes   And what's this fertilizing   So I kind of said   Oh  it's this extra ingredient  you know  that you need to create a new frog from the mom and dad frog.   Laughter  And she said   Oh  so is that true for humans too   And I thought   Okay  here we go.  I didn't know it would happen so quick  at eight. I was trying to remember all the guidebooks  and all I could remember was   Only answer the question they're asking. Don't give any more information.   Laughter  So I said   Yes.  And she said   And where do  um  where do human women  like  where do women lay their eggs   And I said   Well  funny you should ask.  Laughter  We have evolved to have our own pond. We have our very own pond inside our bodies. And we lay our eggs there  we don't have to worry about other eggs or anything like that. It's our own pond. And that's how it happens.  And she goes   Then how do they get fertilized   And I said   Well  Men  through their penis  they fertilize the eggs by the sperm coming out. And you go through the woman's vagina.  And so we're just eating  and her jaw just drops  and she goes   Mom  Like  where you go to the bathroom   And I said   I know. I know.  That's how we evolved. It does seem odd. It is a little bit like having a waste treatment plant right next to an amusement park ... Bad zoning  but ...   Laughter  She's like   What   And she goes   But Mom  but men and women can't ever see each other naked  Mom. So how could that ever happen   And then I go   Well   and then I put my Margaret Mead hat on.  Human males and females develop a special bond  and when they're much older  much  much older than you  and they have a very special feeling  then they can be naked together.  And she said   Mom  have you done this before   And I said   Yes.  And she said   But Mom  you can't have kids.  Because she knows that I adopted her and that I can't have kids. And I said   Yes.  And she said   Well  you don't have to do that again.  And I said   ...  And then she said   But how does it happen when a man and woman are together  Like  how do they know that's the time  Mom  does the man just say  'Is now the time to take off my pants '  And I said   Yes.   That is exactly right. That's exactly how it happens.  So we're driving home and she's looking out the window  and she goes   Mom. What if two just people saw each other on the street  like a man and a woman  they just started doing it. Would that ever happen   And I said   Oh  no. Humans are so private. Oh ...  And then she goes   What if there was like a party  and there was just like a whole bunch of girls and a whole bunch of boys  and there was a bunch of men and women and they just started doing it  Mom  Would that ever happen   And I said   Oh  no  no. That's not how we do it.  Then we got home and we see the cat. And she goes   Mom  how do cats do it   And I go   Oh  it's the same. It's basically the same.  And then she got all caught up in the legs.  But how would the legs go  Mom  I don't understand the legs.  She goes   Mom  everyone can't do the splits.  And I go   I know  but the legs ...  and I'm probably like   The legs get worked out.  And she goes   But I just can't understand it.  So I go   You know  why don't we go on the Internet  and maybe we can see ... like on Wikipedia.   Laughter  So we go online  and we put in  cats mating.  And  unfortunately  on YouTube  there's many cats mating videos. And we watched them and I'm so thankful  because she's just like   Wow  This is so amazing.  She goes   What about dogs   So we put in dogs mating  and  you know  we're watching it  and she's totally absorbed. And then she goes   Mom  do you think they would have  on the Internet  any humans mating   And then I realized that I had taken my little eight year old's hand  and taken her right into Internet porn.  Laughter  And I looked into this trusting  loving face  and I said   Oh  no. That would never happen.  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm so happy to be here. Good afternoon. There's a medical revolution happening all around us  and it's one that's going to help us conquer some of society's most dreaded conditions  including cancer. The revolution is called angiogenesis  and it's based on the process that our bodies use to grow blood vessels. So why should we care about blood vessels  Well  the human body is literally packed with them           miles worth in a typical adult. End to end  that would form a line that would circle the earth twice. The smallest blood vessels are called capillaries. We've got    billion of them in our bodies. And these are the vessels of life  and as I'll show you  they can also be the vessels of death. Now  the remarkable thing about blood vessels is that they have this ability to adapt to whatever environment they're growing in. For example  in the liver  they form channels to detoxify the blood  in the lungs  they line air sacs for gas exchange. In muscle  they corkscrew  so that muscles can contract without cutting off circulation. And in nerves  they course along like power lines  keeping those nerves alive. We get most of these blood vessels when we're actually still in the womb. And what that means is that as adults  blood vessels don't normally grow. Except in a few special circumstances. In women  blood vessels grow every month  to build the lining of the uterus. During pregnancy  they form the placenta  which connects mom and baby. And after injury  blood vessels actually have to grow under the scab in order to heal a wound. And this is actually what it looks like  hundreds of blood vessels  all growing toward the center of the wound. So the body has the ability to regulate the amount of blood vessels that are present at any given time. It does this through an elaborate and elegant system of checks and balances  stimulators and inhibitors of angiogenesis  such that  when we need a brief burst of blood vessels  the body can do this by releasing stimulators  proteins called angiogenic factors  that act as natural fertilizer  and stimulate new blood vessels to sprout. When those excess vessels are no longer needed  the body prunes them back to baseline  using naturally occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis. There are other situations where we start beneath the baseline  and we need to grow more blood vessels  just to get back to normal levels    for example  after an injury    and the body can do that too  but only to that normal level  that set point. But what we now know  is that for a number of diseases  there are defects in the system  where the body can't prune back extra blood vessels  or can't grow enough new ones in the right place at the right time. And in these situations  angiogenesis is out of balance. And when angiogenesis is out of balance  a myriad of diseases result. For example  insufficient angiogenesis    not enough blood vessels    leads to wounds that don't heal  heart attacks  legs without circulation  death from stroke  nerve damage. And on the other end  excessive angiogenesis    too many blood vessels    drives disease  and we see this in cancer  blindness  arthritis  obesity  Alzheimer's disease. In total  there are more than    major diseases affecting more than a billion people worldwide  that all look on the surface to be different from one another  but all actually share abnormal angiogenesis as their common denominator. And this realization is allowing us to re conceptualize the way that we actually approach these diseases  by controlling angiogenesis. Now  I'm going to focus on cancer  because angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer    every type of cancer. So here we go. This is a tumor  dark  gray  ominous mass growing inside a brain. And under the microscope  you can see hundreds of these brown stained blood vessels  capillaries that are feeding cancer cells  bringing oxygen and nutrients. But cancers don't start out like this  and in fact  cancers don't start out with a blood supply. They start out as small  microscopic nests of cells  that can only grow to one half a cubic millimeter in size. That's the tip of a ballpoint pen. Then they can't get any larger because they don't have a blood supply  so they don't have enough oxygen or nutrients. In fact  we're probably forming these microscopic cancers all the time in our body. Autopsy studies from people who died in car accidents have shown that about    percent of women between the ages of    and    actually have microscopic cancers in their breasts. About    percent of men in their   s and   s have microscopic prostate cancers  and virtually     percent of us  by the time we reach our   s  will have microscopic cancers growing in our thyroid. Yet  without a blood supply  most of these cancers will never become dangerous. Dr. Judah Folkman  who was my mentor and who was the pioneer of the angiogenesis field  once called this  cancer without disease.  So the body's ability to balance angiogenesis  when it's working properly  prevents blood vessels from feeding cancers. And this turns out to be one of our most important defense mechanisms against cancer. In fact  if you actually block angiogenesis and prevent blood vessels from ever reaching cancer cells  tumors simply can't grow up. But once angiogenesis occurs  cancers can grow exponentially. And this is actually how a cancer goes from being harmless  to being deadly. Cancer cells mutate  and they gain the ability to release lots of those angiogenic factors  natural fertilizer  that tip the balance in favor of blood vessels invading the cancer. And once those vessels invade the cancer  it can expand  it can invade local tissues  and the same vessels that are feeding tumors allow cancer cells to exit into the circulation as metastases. And unfortunately  this late stage of cancer is the one at which it's most likely to be diagnosed  when angiogenesis is already turned on  and cancer cells are growing like wild. So  if angiogenesis is a tipping point between a harmless cancer and a harmful one  then one major part of the angiogenesis revolution is a new approach to treating cancer by cutting off the blood supply. We call this antiangiogenic therapy  and it's completely different from chemotherapy  because it selectively aims at the blood vessels that are feeding the cancers. We can do this because tumor blood vessels are unlike normal  healthy vessels we see in other places of the body    they're abnormal  they're very poorly constructed  and because of that  they're highly vulnerable to treatments that target them. In effect  when we give cancer patients antiangiogenic therapy    here  an experimental drug for a glioma  which is a type of brain tumor    you can see that there are dramatic changes that occur when the tumor is being starved. Here's a woman with a breast cancer  being treated with the antiangiogenic drug called Avastin  which is FDA approved. And you can see that the halo of blood flow disappears after treatment. Well  I've just shown you two very different types of cancer that both responded to antiangiogenic therapy. So a few years ago  I asked myself   Can we take this one step further and treat other cancers  even in other species   So here is a nine year old boxer named Milo  who had a very aggressive tumor called a malignant neurofibroma growing on his shoulder. It invaded into his lungs. His veterinarian only gave him three months to live. So we created a cocktail of antiangiogenic drugs that could be mixed into his dog food  as well as an antiangiogenic cream  that could be applied on the surface of the tumor. And within a few weeks of treatment  we were able to slow down that cancer's growth  such that we were ultimately able to extend Milo s survival to six times what the veterinarian had initially predicted  all with a very good quality of life. And we've subsequently treated more than     dogs. We have about a    percent response rate  and improved survival for these pets that were about to be euthanized. So let me show you a couple of even more interesting examples. This is    year old dolphin living in Florida  and she had these lesions in her mouth that  over the course of three years  developed into invasive squamous cell cancers. So we created an antiangiogenic paste. We had it painted on top of the cancer three times a week. And over the course of seven months  the cancers completely disappeared  and the biopsies came back as normal. Here's a cancer growing on the lip of a Quarter Horse named Guinness. It's a very  very deadly type of cancer called an angiosarcoma. It had already spread to his lymph nodes  so we used an antiangiogenic skin cream for the lip  and the oral cocktail  so we could treat from the inside as well as the outside. And over the course of six months  he experienced a complete remission. And here he is six years later  Guinness  with his very happy owner. Now obviously  antiangiogenic therapy could be used for a wide range of cancers. And in fact  the first pioneering treatments for people as well as dogs  are already becoming available. There are    different drugs     different cancer types. But the real question is  How well do these work in practice  So here's actually the patient survival data from eight different types of cancer. The bars represent survival time taken from the era in which there was only chemotherapy  or surgery  or radiation available. But starting in       when antiangiogenic therapies first became available  you can see that there has been a    to     percent improvement in survival for people with kidney cancer  multiple myeloma  colorectal cancer  and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. That's impressive. But for other tumors and cancer types  the improvements have only been modest. So I started asking myself   Why haven't we been able to do better   And the answer  to me  is obvious  we're treating cancer too late in the game  when it's already established  and oftentimes  it's already spread or metastasized. And as a doctor  I know that once a disease progresses to an advanced stage  achieving a cure can be difficult  if not impossible. So I went back to the biology of angiogenesis  and started thinking  Could the answer to cancer be preventing angiogenesis  beating cancer at its own game  so the cancers could never become dangerous  This could help healthy people  as well as people who've already beaten cancer once or twice  and want to find a way to keep it from coming back. So to look for a way to prevent angiogenesis in cancer  I went back to look at cancer's causes. And what really intrigued me  was when I saw that diet accounts for    to    percent of environmentally caused cancers. Now the obvious thing is to think about what we could remove from our diet  what to strip out  take away. But I actually took a completely opposite approach  and began asking  What could we be adding to our diet that's naturally antiangiogenic  and that could boost the body's defense system  and beat back those blood vessels that are feeding cancers  In other words  can we eat to starve cancer  Well  the answer is yes  and I'm going to show you how. And our search for this has taken us to the market  the farm and to the spice cabinet  because what we've discovered is that Mother Nature has laced a large number of foods and beverages and herbs with naturally occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis. Here's a test system we developed. At the center is a ring from which hundreds of blood vessels are growing out in a starburst fashion. And we can use this system to test dietary factors at concentrations that are obtainable by eating. Let me show you what happens when we put in an extract from red grapes. The active ingredient is resveratrol  it's also found in red wine. This inhibits abnormal angiogenesis  by    percent. Here's what happens when we added an extract from strawberries. It potently inhibits angiogenesis. And extract from soybeans. And here is a growing list of antiangiogenic foods and beverages that we're interested in studying. For each food type  we believe that there are different potencies within different strains and varietals. And we want to measure this because  well  while you're eating a strawberry or drinking tea  why not select the one that's most potent for preventing cancer  So here are four different teas that we've tested. They're all common ones  Chinese jasmine  Japanese sencha  Earl Grey and a special blend that we prepared  and you can see clearly that the teas vary in their potency  from less potent to more potent. But what's very cool is when we combine the two less potent teas together  the combination  the blend  is more potent than either one alone. This means there's food synergy. Here's some more data from our testing. Now in the lab  we can simulate tumor angiogenesis  represented here in a black bar. And using this system  we can test the potency of cancer drugs. So the shorter the bar  the less angiogenesis    that's good. And here are some common drugs that have been associated with reducing the risk of cancer in people. Statins  nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs  and a few others    they inhibit angiogenesis  too. And here are the dietary factors going head to head against these drugs. You can see they clearly hold their own  and in some cases  they're more potent than the actual drugs. Soy  parsley  garlic  grapes  berries. I could go home and cook a tasty meal using these ingredients. Imagine if we could create the world's first rating system  in which we could score foods according to their antiangiogenic  cancer preventative properties. And that's what we're doing right now. Now  I've shown you a bunch of lab data  and so the real question is  What is the evidence in people that eating certain foods can reduce angiogenesis in cancer  Well  the best example I know is a study of        men followed over    years  in which it was found that men who consumed cooked tomatoes two to three times a week  had up to a    percent reduction in their risk of developing prostate cancer. Now  we know that tomatoes are a good source of lycopene  and lycopene is antiangiogenic. But what's even more interesting from this study  is that in those men who did develop prostate cancer  those who ate more servings of tomato sauce  actually had fewer blood vessels feeding their cancer. So this human study is a prime example of how antiangiogenic substances present in food and consumed at practical levels  can have an impact on cancer. And we're now studying the role of a healthy diet    with Dean Ornish at UCSF and Tufts University    the role of this healthy diet on markers of angiogenesis that we can find in the bloodstream. Obviously  what I've shared with you has some far ranging implications  even beyond cancer research. Because if we're right  it could impact consumer education  food services  public health and even the insurance industry. And in fact  some insurance companies are already beginning to think along these lines. Check out this ad from BlueCross BlueShield of Minnesota. For many people around the world  dietary cancer prevention may be the only practical solution  because not everybody can afford expensive end stage cancer treatments  but everybody could benefit from a healthy diet based on local  sustainable  antiangiogenic crops. Now  finally  I've talked to you about food  and I've talked to you about cancer  so there's just one more disease that I have to tell you about  and that's obesity. Because it turns out that adipose tissue    fat    is highly angiogenesis dependent. And like a tumor  fat grows when blood vessels grow. So the question is  Can we shrink fat by cutting off its blood supply  The top curve shows the body weight of a genetically obese mouse that eats nonstop until it turns fat  like this furry tennis ball. And the bottom curve is the weight of a normal mouse. If you take the obese mouse and give it an angiogenesis inhibitor  it loses weight. Stop the treatment  gains the weight back. Restart the treatment  loses the weight. Stop the treatment  it gains the weight back. And  in fact  you can cycle the weight up and down simply by inhibiting angiogenesis. So this approach that we're taking for cancer prevention may also have an application for obesity. The truly interesting thing about this is that we can't take these obese mice and make them lose more weight than what the normal mouse's weight is supposed to be. In other words  we can't create supermodel mice. And this speaks to the role of angiogenesis in regulating healthy set points. Albert Szent Gy rgi once said   Discovery consists of seeing what everyone has seen  and thinking what no one has thought.  I hope I've convinced you that for diseases like cancer  obesity and other conditions  there may be a great power in attacking their common denominator  angiogenesis. And that's what I think the world needs now. Thank you. June Cohen  I have a quick question for you. JC  So these drugs aren't exactly in mainstream cancer treatments right now. For anyone out here who has cancer  what would you recommend  Do you recommend pursuing these treatments now  for most cancer patients  William Li  There are antiangiogenic treatments that are FDA approved  and if you're a cancer patient  or working for one or advocating for one  you should ask about them. And there are many clinical trials. The Angiogenesis Foundation is following almost     companies  and there are about     more drugs in that pipeline. So  consider the approved ones  look for clinical trials  but then between what the doctor can do for you  we need to start asking what can we do for ourselves. This is one of the themes I'm talking about  We can empower ourselves to do the things that doctors can't do for us  which is to use knowledge and take action. And if Mother Nature has given us some clues  we think there might be a new future in the value of how we eat  and what we eat is really our chemotherapy three times a day. JC  Right. And along those lines  for people who might have risk factors for cancer  would you recommend pursuing any treatments prophylactically  or simply pursuing the right diet  with lots of tomato sauce  WL  Well  you know  there's abundant epidemiological evidence  and I think in the information age  it doesn't take long to go to a credible source like PubMed  the National Library of Medicine  to look for epidemiological studies for cancer risk reduction based on diet and based on common medications. And that's certainly something that anybody can look into. JC  Okay. Well  thank you so much. About a year ago  I asked myself a question   Knowing what I know  why am I not a vegetarian   After all  I'm one of the green guys  I grew up with hippie parents in a log cabin. I started a site called TreeHugger    I care about this stuff. I knew that eating a mere hamburger a day can increase my risk of dying by a third. Cruelty  I knew that the    billion animals we raise each year for meat are raised in factory farm conditions that we  hypocritically  wouldn't even consider for our own cats  dogs and other pets. Environmentally  meat  amazingly  causes more emissions than all of transportation combined  cars  trains  planes  buses  boats  all of it. And beef production uses     times the water that most vegetables do. I also knew that I'm not alone. We as a society are eating twice as much meat as we did in the   s. So what was once the special little side treat now is the main  much more regular. So really  any of these angles should have been enough to convince me to go vegetarian. Yet  there I was    chk  chk  chk    tucking into a big old steak. So why was I stalling  I realized that what I was being pitched was a binary solution. It was either you're a meat eater or you're a vegetarian  and I guess I just wasn't quite ready. Imagine your last hamburger. So my common sense  my good intentions  were in conflict with my taste buds. And I'd commit to doing it later  and not surprisingly  later never came. Sound familiar  So I wondered  might there be a third solution  And I thought about it  and I came up with one. I've been doing it for the last year  and it's great. It's called weekday veg. The name says it all  Nothing with a face Monday through Friday. On the weekend  your choice. Simple. If you want to take it to the next level  remember  the major culprits in terms of environmental damage and health are red and processed meats. So you want to swap those out with some good  sustainably harvested fish. It's structured  so it ends up being simple to remember  and it's okay to break it here and there. After all  cutting five days a week is cutting    percent of your meat intake. The program has been great  weekday veg. My footprint's smaller  I'm lessening pollution  I feel better about the animals  I'm even saving money. Best of all  I'm healthier  I know that I'm going to live longer  and I've even lost a little weight. So  please ask yourselves  for your health  for your pocketbook  for the environment  for the animals  What's stopping you from giving weekday veg a shot  After all  if all of us ate half as much meat  it would be like half of us were vegetarians. Thank you. I want to talk about penguins today. But first  I want to start by saying that we need a new operating system  for the oceans and for the Earth. When I came to the Galapagos    years ago  there were       people that lived in the Galapagos. Now there are over       . There were two Jeeps on Santa Cruz. Now  there are around a thousand trucks and buses and cars there. So the fundamental problems that we face are overconsumption and too many people. It's the same problems in the Galapagos  except  obviously  it's worse here  in some ways  than other places. Because we've only doubled the population of the Earth since the     s    a little more than doubled    but we have  .  billion people in the world  and we all like to consume. And one of the major problems that we have is our operating system is not giving us the proper feedback. We're not paying the true environmental costs of our actions. And when I came at age    to live on Fernandina  let me just say  that I had never camped before. I had never lived alone for any period of time  and I'd never slept with sea lions snoring next to me all night. But moreover  I'd never lived on an uninhabited island. Punta Espinosa is where I lived for over a year  and we call it uninhabited because there are no people there. But it's alive with life  it's hardly uninhabited. So a lot has happened in the last    years  and what I learned when I came to the Galapagos is the importance of wild places  wild things  certainly wildlife  and the amazing qualities that penguins have. Penguins are real athletes  They can swim     kilometers in a day. They can swim at the same speed day and night    that's faster than any Olympic swimmer. I mean  they can do like seven kilometers an hour and sustain it. But what is really amazing  because of this deepness here  Emperor penguins can go down more than     meters and they can hold their breath for    minutes. Magellanic penguins  the ones that I work on  they can dive to about    meters and they can stay down for about  .  minutes. Humans  without fins     meters   .  minutes. And I doubt anybody in this room could really hold their breath for  .  minutes. You have to train to be able to do that. So penguins are amazing athletes. The other thing is  I've never met anybody that really doesn't say that they like penguins. They're comical  they walk upright  and  of course  they're diligent. And  more importantly  they're well dressed. So they have all the criteria that people normally like. But scientifically  they're amazing because they're sentinels. They tell us about our world in a lot of different ways  and particularly the ocean. This is a picture of a Galapagos penguin that's on the front of a little zodiac here in the Galapagos. And that's what I came to study. I thought I was going to study the social behavior of Galapagos penguins  but you already know penguins are rare. These are the rarest penguins in the world. Why I thought I was going to be able to do that  I don't know. But the population has changed dramatically since I was first here. When I counted penguins for the first time and tried to do a census  we just counted all the individual beaks that we could around all these islands. We counted around        so I don't know how many penguins there really are  but I know I can count      . If you go and do it now  the national parks count about    . So we have a quarter of the penguins that we did    years ago. And this is true of most of our living systems. We have less than we had before  and most of them are in fairly steep decline. And I want to just show you a little bit about why. That's a penguin braying to tell you that it's important to pay attention to penguins. Most important of all  I didn't know what that was the first time I heard it. And you can imagine sleeping on Fernandina your first night there and you hear this lonesome  plaintful call. I fell in love with penguins  and it certainly has changed the rest of my life. What I found out I was studying is really the difference in how the Galapagos changes  the most extreme variation. You've heard about these El Ninos  but this is the extreme that penguins all over the world have to adapt to. This is a cold water event called La Nina. Where it's blue and it's green  it means the water is really cold. And so you can see this current coming up    in this case  the Humboldt Current    that comes all the way out to the Galapagos Islands  and this deep undersea current  the Cromwell Current  that upwells around the Galapagos. That brings all the nutrients  When this is cold in the Galapagos  it's rich  and there's plenty of food for everyone. When we have extreme El Nino events  you see all this red  and you see no green out here around the Galapagos. That means that there's no upwelling  and there's basically no food. So it's a real desert for not only for the penguins and the sea lions and the marine iguanas ... things die when there's no food. But we didn't even know that that affected the Galapagos when I went to study penguins. And you can imagine being on an island hoping you're going to see penguins  and you're in the middle of an El Nino event and there are no penguins. They're not breeding  they're not even around. I studied marine iguanas at that point. But this is a global phenomenon  we know that. And if you look along the coast of Argentina  where I work now  at a place called Punta Tombo    the largest Magellanic penguin colony in the world down here about    degrees south latitude    you see that there's great variation here. Some years  the cold water goes all the way up to Brazil  and other years  in these La Nina years  it doesn't. So the oceans don't always act together  they act differently  but that is the kind of variation that penguins have to live with  and it's not easy. So when I went to study the Magellanic penguins  I didn't have any problems. There were plenty of them. This is a picture at Punta Tombo in February showing all the penguins along the beach. I went there because the Japanese wanted to start harvesting them and turning them into high fashion golf gloves  protein and oil. Fortunately  nobody has harvested any penguins and we're getting over         tourists a year to see them. But the population is declining and it's declined fairly substantially  about    percent since       when I started these surveys  in terms of number of active nests. Here  you can see where Punta Tombo is  and they breed in incredibly dense colonies. We know this because of long term science  because we have long term studies there. And science is important in informing decision makers  and also in changing how we do and knowing the direction of change that we're going in. And so we have this penguin project. The Wildlife Conservation Society has funded me along with a lot of individuals over the last    years to be able to produce these kinds of maps. And also  we know that it's not only Galapagos penguins that are in trouble  but Magellanics and many other species of penguins. And so we have started a global penguin society to try to focus on the real plight of penguins. This is one of the plights of penguins  oil pollution. Penguins don't like oil and they don't like to swim through oil. The nice thing is  if you look down here in Argentina  there's no surface oil pollution from this composite map. But  in fact  when we went to Argentina  penguins were often found totally covered in oil. So they were just minding their own business. They ended up swimming through ballast water that had oil in it. Because when tankers carry oil they have to have ballast at some point  so when they're empty  they have the ballast water in there. When they come back  they actually dump this oily ballast water into the ocean. Why do they do that  Because it's cheaper  because they don't pay the real environmental costs. We usually don't  and we want to start getting the accounting system right so we can pay the real cost. At first  the Argentine government said   No  there's no way. You can't find oiled penguins in Argentina. We have laws  and we can't have illegal dumping  it's against the law.  So we ended up spending nine years convincing the government that there were lots of oiled penguins. In some years  like this year  we found more than    percent of the adult penguins dead on the beach were covered in oil. These little blue dots are the fledglings    we do this survey every March    which means that they're only in the environment from January until March  so maybe three months at the most that they could get covered in oil. And you can see  in some years over    percent of the fledglings were oiled. Eventually  the government listened and  amazingly  they changed their laws. They moved the tanker lanes    kilometers farther off shore  and people are not doing as much illegal dumping. So what we're seeing now is very few penguins are oiled. Why are there even these penguins oiled  Because we've solved the problem in Chubut province  which is like a state in Argentina where Punta Tombo is    so that's about       kilometers of coastline    but we haven't solved the problem in northern Argentina  Uruguay and Brazil. So now I want to show you that penguins are affected. I'm just going to talk about two things. This is climate change. Now this has really been a fun study because I put satellite tags on the back of these Magellanic penguins. Try to convince donors to give you a couple thousand dollars to glue a satellite tag on the back of penguins. But we've been doing this now for more than a decade to learn where they go. We thought we needed a marine protected area of about    kilometers  and then we put a satellite tag on the back of a penguin. And what the penguins show us    and these are all the little dots from where the penguins' positions were for penguins in incubation in         and what you see is some of these individuals are going     kilometers away from their nests. So that means as their mate is sitting on the nest incubating the eggs  the other one is out there foraging  and the longer they have to stay gone  the worse condition the mate is in when the mate comes back. And  of course  all of this then leads to a vicious cycle and you can't raise a lot of chicks. Here you see in         these are all the dots of where the penguins are    they were raising a little over a half of a chick. Here  you can see in       they raised almost three quarters of a chick per nest  and you can see that they're closer to Punta Tombo  they're not going as far away. This past year  in       you can see that they're now raising about a fourth of a chick  and some of these individuals are going more than     kilometers away from their nests. So it's kind of like you having a job in Chicago  and then you get transferred to St. Louis  and your mate is not happy about this because you've got to pay airfare  because you're gone longer. The same thing's true for penguins as well. And they're going about  on average now     kilometers farther than they did a decade ago. We need to be able to get information out to the general public. And so we started a publication with the Society for Conservation that we think presents cutting edge science in a new  novel way  because we have reporters that are good writers that actually can distill the information and make it accessible to the general public. So if you're interested in cutting edge science and smarter conservation  you should join with our    partners    some of them here in this room  like the Nature Conservancy    and look at this magazine because we need to get information out about conservation to the general public. Lastly I want to say that all of you  probably  have had some relationship at some time in your life with a dog  a cat  some sort of pet  and you recognized that those are individuals. And some of you consider them almost part of your family. If you had a relationship with a penguin  you'd see it in the same sort of way. They're amazing creatures that really change how you view the world because they're not that different from us  They're trying to make a living  they're trying to raise their offspring  they're trying to get on and survive in the world. This is Turbo the Penguin. Turbo's never been fed. He met us and got his name because he started standing under my diesel truck  a turbo truck  so we named him Turbo. Turbo has taken to knocking on the door with his beak  we let him in and he comes in here. And I just wanted to show you what happened one day when Turbo brought in a friend. So this is Turbo. He's coming up to one of my graduate students and flipper patting  which he would do to a female penguin. And you can see  he's not trying to bite. This guy has never been in before and he's trying to figure out   What is going on  What is this guy doing  This is really pretty weird.  And you'll see soon that my graduate student ... and you see  Turbo's pretty intent on his flipper patting. And now he's looking at the other guy  saying   You are really weird.  And now look at this  not friendly. So penguins really differ in their personalities just like our dogs and our cats. We're also trying to collect our information and become more technologically literate. So we're trying to put that in computers in the field. And penguins are always involved in helping us or not helping us in one way or another. This is a radio frequency ID system. You put a little piece of rice in the foot of a penguin that has a barcode  so it tells you who it is. It walks over the pad  and you know who it is. Okay  so here are a few penguins coming in. See  this one's coming back to its nest. They're all coming in at this time  walking across there  just kind of leisurely coming in. Here's a female that's in a hurry. She's got food. She's really rushing back  because it's hot  to try to feed her chicks. And then there's another fellow that will leisurely come by. Look how fat he is. He's walking back to feed his chicks. Then I realize that they're playing king of the box. This is my box up here  and this is the system that works. You can see this penguin  he goes over  he looks at those wires  does not like that wire. He unplugs the wire  we have no data. So  they really are pretty amazing creatures. OK. Most important thing is  Only you can change yourself  and only you can change the world and make it better  for people as well as penguins. So  thank you very much.  Applause  For the next few minutes we're going to talk about energy  and it's going to be a bit of a varied talk. I'll try to spin a story about energy  and oil's a convenient starting place. The talk will be broadly about energy  but oil's a good place to start. And one of the reasons is this is remarkable stuff. You take about eight or so carbon atoms  about    hydrogen atoms  you put them together in exactly the right way and you get this marvelous liquid  very energy dense and very easy to refine into a number of very useful products and fuels. It's great stuff. Now  as far as it goes  there's a lot of oil out there in the world. Here's my little pocket map of where it's all located. A bigger one for you to look at. But this is it  this is the oil in the world. Geologists have a pretty good idea of where the oil is. This is about     trillion gallons of crude oil still to be developed and produced in the world today. Now  that's just one story about oil  and we could end it there and say   Well  oil's going to last forever because  well  there's just a lot of it.  But there's actually more to the story than that. Oh  by the way  if you think you're very far from some of this oil       meters below where you're all sitting is one of the largest producing oil fields in the world. Come talk to me about it  I'll fill in some of the details if you want. So  that's one of the stories of oil  there's just a lot of it. But what about oil  Where is it in the energy system  Here's a little snapshot of     years of oil  and it's been a dominant part of our energy system for most of those     years. Now  here's another little secret I'm going to tell you about  For the last    years  oil has been playing less and less of a role in global energy systems. There was one kind of peak oil in       when oil represented    percent of global energy supply. Now  it's about    percent. It's been declining and I believe it will continue to decline. Gasoline consumption in the U.S. probably peaked in      and is declining. So oil is playing a less significant role every year. And so     years ago  there was a peak oil  just like  in the     s  there was a peak coal  and a hundred years before that  there was a peak wood. This is a very important picture of the evolution of energy systems. And what's been taking up the slack in the last few decades  Well  a lot of natural gas and a little bit of nuclear  for starters. And what goes on in the future  Well  I think out ahead of us a few decades is peak gas  and beyond that  peak renewables. Now  I'll tell you another little  very important story about this picture. Now  I'm not pretending that energy use in total isn't increasing  it is    that's another part of the story. Come talk to me about it  we'll fill in some of the details    but there's a very important message here  This is     years of history  and for     years we've been systematically decarbonizing our energy system. Energy systems of the world becoming progressively    year on year  decade on decade  century on century    becoming less carbon intense. And that continues into the future with the renewables that we're developing today  reaching maybe    percent of primary energy by mid century. Now that might be the end of the story    Okay  we just replace it all with conventional renewables    but I think  actually  there's more to the story than that. And to tell the next part of the story    and this is looking out say      and beyond. What is the future of truly sustainable  carbon free energy  Well  we have to take a little excursion  and we'll start in central Texas. Here's a piece of limestone. I picked it up outside of Marble Falls  Texas. It's about     million years old. And it's just limestone  nothing really special about it. Now  here's a piece of chalk. I picked this up at MIT. It's a little younger. And it's different than this limestone  you can see that. You wouldn't build a building out of this stuff  and you wouldn't try to give a lecture and write on the chalkboard with this. Yeah  it's very different    no  it's not different. It's not different  it's the same stuff  calcium carbonate  calcium carbonate. What's different is how the molecules are put together. Now  if you think that's kind of neat  the story gets really neat right now. Off the coast of California comes this  It's an abalone shell. Now  millions of abalone every year make this shell. Oh  by the way  just in case you weren't already guessing  it's calcium carbonate. It's the same stuff as this and the same stuff as this. But it's not the same stuff  it's different. It's thousands of times  maybe       times tougher than this. And why  Because the lowly abalone is able to lay down the calcium carbonate crystals in layers  making this beautiful  iridescent mother of pearl. Very specialized material that the abalone self assembles  millions of abalone  all the time  every day  every year. This is pretty incredible stuff. All the same  what's different  How the molecules are put together. Now  what does this have to do with energy  Here's a piece of coal. And I'll suggest that this coal is about as exciting as this chalk. Now  whether we're talking about fuels or energy carriers  or perhaps novel materials for batteries or fuel cells  nature hasn't ever built those perfect materials yet because nature didn't need to. Nature didn't need to because  unlike the abalone shell  the survival of a species didn't depend on building those materials  until maybe now when it might just matter. So  when we think about the future of energy  imagine what would it be like if instead of this  we could build the energy equivalent of this just by rearranging the molecules differently. And so that is my story. The oil will never run out. It's not because we have a lot of it. It's not because we're going to build a bajillion windmills. It's because  well  thousands of years ago  people invented ideas    they had ideas  innovations  technology    and the Stone Age ended  not because we ran out of stones. It's ideas  it's innovation  it's technology that will end the age of oil  long before we run out of oil. Thank you very much. We're here today to announce the first synthetic cell  a cell made by starting with the digital code in the computer  building the chromosome from four bottles of chemicals  assembling that chromosome in yeast  transplanting it into a recipient bacterial cell and transforming that cell into a new bacterial species. So this is the first self replicating species that we've had on the planet whose parent is a computer. It also is the first species to have its own website encoded in its genetic code. But we'll talk more about the watermarks in a minute. This is a project that had its inception    years ago when our team then    we called the institute TIGR    was involved in sequencing the first two genomes in history. We did Haemophilus influenzae and then the smallest genome of a self replicating organism  that of Mycoplasma genitalium. And as soon as we had these two sequences we thought  if this is supposed to be the smallest genome of a self replicating species  could there be even a smaller genome  Could we understand the basis of cellular life at the genetic level  It's been a    year quest just to get to the starting point now to be able to answer those questions  because it's very difficult to eliminate multiple genes from a cell. You can only do them one at a time. We decided early on that we had to take a synthetic route  even though nobody had been there before  to see if we could synthesize a bacterial chromosome so we could actually vary the gene content to understand the essential genes for life. That started our    year quest to get here. But before we did the first experiments  we actually asked Art Caplan's team at the University of Pennsylvania to undertake a review of what the risks  the challenges  the ethics around creating new species in the laboratory were because it hadn't been done before. They spent about two years reviewing that independently and published their results in Science in     . Ham and I took two years off as a side project to sequence the human genome  but as soon as that was done we got back to the task at hand. In       we started a new institute  the Institute for Biological Energy Alternatives  where we set out two goals  One  to understand the impact of our technology on the environment  and how to understand the environment better  and two  to start down this process of making synthetic life to understand basic life. In       we published our first success. So Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison developed some new methods for making error free DNA at a small level. Our first task was a       letter code bacteriophage  a virus that attacks only E. coli. So that was the phage phi X      which was chosen for historical reasons. It was the first DNA phage  DNA virus  DNA genome that was actually sequenced. So once we realized that we could make       base pair viral sized pieces  we thought  we at least have the means then to try and make serially lots of these pieces to be able to eventually assemble them together to make this mega base chromosome. So  substantially larger than we even thought we would go initially. There were several steps to this. There were two sides  We had to solve the chemistry for making large DNA molecules  and we had to solve the biological side of how  if we had this new chemical entity  how would we boot it up  activate it in a recipient cell. We had two teams working in parallel  one team on the chemistry  and the other on trying to be able to transplant entire chromosomes to get new cells. When we started this out  we thought the synthesis would be the biggest problem  which is why we chose the smallest genome. And some of you have noticed that we switched from the smallest genome to a much larger one. And we can walk through the reasons for that  but basically the small cell took on the order of one to two months to get results from  whereas the larger  faster growing cell takes only two days. So there's only so many cycles we could go through in a year at six weeks per cycle. And you should know that basically     probably    percent plus of our experiments failed. So this was a debugging  problem solving scenario from the beginning because there was no recipe of how to get there. So  one of the most important publications we had was in     . Carole Lartigue led the effort to actually transplant a bacterial chromosome from one bacteria to another. I think philosophically  that was one of the most important papers that we've ever done because it showed how dynamic life was. And we knew  once that worked  that we actually had a chance if we could make the synthetic chromosomes to do the same with those. We didn't know that it was going to take us several years more to get there. In       we reported the complete synthesis of the Mycoplasma genitalium genome  a little over         letters of genetic code  but we have not yet succeeded in booting up that chromosome. We think in part  because of its slow growth and  in part  cells have all kinds of unique defense mechanisms to keep these events from happening. It turned out the cell that we were trying to transplant into had a nuclease  an enzyme that chews up DNA on its surface  and was happy to eat the synthetic DNA that we gave it and never got transplantations. But at the time  that was the largest molecule of a defined structure that had been made. And so both sides were progressing  but part of the synthesis had to be accomplished or was able to be accomplished using yeast  putting the fragments in yeast and yeast would assemble these for us. It's an amazing step forward  but we had a problem because now we had the bacterial chromosomes growing in yeast. So in addition to doing the transplant  we had to find out how to get a bacterial chromosome out of the eukaryotic yeast into a form where we could transplant it into a recipient cell. So our team developed new techniques for actually growing  cloning entire bacterial chromosomes in yeast. So we took the same mycoides genome that Carole had initially transplanted  and we grew that in yeast as an artificial chromosome. And we thought this would be a great test bed for learning how to get chromosomes out of yeast and transplant them. When we did these experiments  though  we could get the chromosome out of yeast but it wouldn't transplant and boot up a cell. That little issue took the team two years to solve. It turns out  the DNA in the bacterial cell was actually methylated  and the methylation protects it from the restriction enzyme  from digesting the DNA. So what we found is if we took the chromosome out of yeast and methylated it  we could then transplant it. Further advances came when the team removed the restriction enzyme genes from the recipient capricolum cell. And once we had done that  now we can take naked DNA out of yeast and transplant it. So last fall when we published the results of that work in Science  we all became overconfident and were sure we were only a few weeks away from being able to now boot up a chromosome out of yeast. Because of the problems with Mycoplasma genitalium and its slow growth about a year and a half ago  we decided to synthesize the much larger chromosome  the mycoides chromosome  knowing that we had the biology worked out on that for transplantation. And Dan led the team for the synthesis of this over one million base pair chromosome. But it turned out it wasn't going to be as simple in the end  and it set us back three months because we had one error out of over a million base pairs in that sequence. So the team developed new debugging software  where we could test each synthetic fragment to see if it would grow in a background of wild type DNA. And we found that    out of the            base pair pieces we synthesized were completely accurate and compatible with a life forming sequence. We narrowed it down to one fragment  we sequenced it and found just one base pair had been deleted in an essential gene. So accuracy is essential. There's parts of the genome where it cannot tolerate even a single error  and then there's parts of the genome where we can put in large blocks of DNA  as we did with the watermarks  and it can tolerate all kinds of errors. So it took about three months to find that error and repair it. And then early one morning  at   a.m. we got a text from Dan saying that  now  the first blue colonies existed. So  it's been a long route to get here     years from the beginning. We felt one of the tenets of this field was to make absolutely certain we could distinguish synthetic DNA from natural DNA. Early on  when you're working in a new area of science  you have to think about all the pitfalls and things that could lead you to believe that you had done something when you hadn't  and  even worse  leading others to believe it. So  we thought the worst problem would be a single molecule contamination of the native chromosome  leading us to believe that we actually had created a synthetic cell  when it would have been just a contaminant. So early on  we developed the notion of putting in watermarks in the DNA to absolutely make clear that the DNA was synthetic. And the first chromosome we built in         the         base pair one    we simply assigned the names of the authors of the chromosome into the genetic code  but it was using just amino acid single letter translations  which leaves out certain letters of the alphabet. So the team actually developed a new code within the code within the code. So it's a new code for interpreting and writing messages in DNA. Now  mathematicians have been hiding and writing messages in the genetic code for a long time  but it's clear they were mathematicians and not biologists because  if you write long messages with the code that the mathematicians developed  it would more than likely lead to new proteins being synthesized with unknown functions. So the code that Mike Montague and the team developed actually puts frequent stop codons  so it's a different alphabet but allows us to use the entire English alphabet with punctuation and numbers. So  there are four major watermarks all over       base pairs of genetic code. The first one actually contains within it this code for interpreting the rest of the genetic code. So in the remaining information  in the watermarks  contain the names of  I think it's    different authors and key contributors to getting the project to this stage. And we also built in a website address so that if somebody decodes the code within the code within the code  they can send an email to that address. So it's clearly distinguishable from any other species  having    names in it  its own web address. And we added three quotations  because with the first genome we were criticized for not trying to say something more profound than just signing the work. So we won't give the rest of the code  but we will give the three quotations. The first is   To live  to err  to fall  to triumph and to recreate life out of life.  It's a James Joyce quote. The second quotation is   See things not as they are  but as they might be.  It's a quote from the  American Prometheus  book on Robert Oppenheimer. And the last one is a Richard Feynman quote   What I cannot build  I cannot understand.  So  because this is as much a philosophical advance as a technical advance in science  we tried to deal with both the philosophical and the technical side. The last thing I want to say before turning it over to questions is that the extensive work that we've done    asking for ethical review  pushing the envelope on that side as well as the technical side    this has been broadly discussed in the scientific community  in the policy community and at the highest levels of the federal government. Even with this announcement  as we did in         that work was funded by the Department of Energy  so the work was reviewed at the level of the White House  trying to decide whether to classify the work or publish it. And they came down on the side of open publication  which is the right approach    we've briefed the White House  we've briefed members of Congress  we've tried to take and push the policy issues in parallel with the scientific advances. So with that  I would like to open it first to the floor for questions. Yes  in the back. Reporter  Could you explain  in layman's terms  how significant a breakthrough this is please  Craig Venter  Can we explain how significant this is  I'm not sure we're the ones that should be explaining how significant it is. It's significant to us. Perhaps it's a giant philosophical change in how we view life. We actually view it as a baby step in terms of  it's taken us    years to be able to do the experiment we wanted to do    years ago on understanding life at its basic level. But we actually believe this is going to be a very powerful set of tools and we're already starting in numerous avenues to use this tool. We have  at the Institute  ongoing funding now from NIH in a program with Novartis to try and use these new synthetic DNA tools to perhaps make the flu vaccine that you might get next year. Because instead of taking weeks to months to make these  Dan's team can now make these in less than    hours. So when you see how long it took to get an H N  vaccine out  we think we can shorten that process quite substantially. In the vaccine area  Synthetic Genomics and the Institute are forming a new vaccine company because we think these tools can affect vaccines to diseases that haven't been possible to date  things where the viruses rapidly evolve  such with rhinovirus. Wouldn't it be nice to have something that actually blocked common colds  Or  more importantly  HIV  where the virus evolves so quickly the vaccines that are made today can't keep up with those evolutionary changes. Also  at Synthetic Genomics  we've been working on major environmental issues. I think this latest oil spill in the Gulf is a reminder. We can't see CO     we depend on scientific measurements for it and we see the beginning results of having too much of it    but we can see pre CO  now floating on the waters and contaminating the beaches in the Gulf. We need some alternatives for oil. We have a program with Exxon Mobile to try and develop new strains of algae that can efficiently capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or from concentrated sources  make new hydrocarbons that can go into their refineries to make normal gasoline and diesel fuel out of CO . Those are just a couple of the approaches and directions that we're taking. I was here four years ago  and I remember  at the time  that the talks weren't put online. I think they were given to TEDsters in a box  a box set of DVDs  which they put on their shelves  where they are now. And actually  Chris called me a week after I'd given my talk  and said   We're going to start putting them online. Can we put yours online   And I said   Sure.  And four years later  it's been downloaded four million times. So I suppose you could multiply that by    or something to get the number of people who've seen it. And  as Chris says  there is a hunger for videos of me. Don't you feel  So  this whole event has been an elaborate build up to me doing another one for you  so here it is. Al Gore spoke at the TED conference I spoke at four years ago and talked about the climate crisis. And I referenced that at the end of my last talk. So I want to pick up from there because I only had    minutes  frankly. So  as I was saying    You see  he's right. I mean  there is a major climate crisis  obviously  and I think if people don't believe it  they should get out more. But I believe there is a second climate crisis  which is as severe  which has the same origins  and that we have to deal with with the same urgency. And you may say  by the way   Look  I'm good. I have one climate crisis  I don't really need the second one.  But this is a crisis of  not natural resources    though I believe that's true    but a crisis of human resources. I believe fundamentally  as many speakers have said during the past few days  that we make very poor use of our talents. Very many people go through their whole lives having no real sense of what their talents may be  or if they have any to speak of. I meet all kinds of people who don't think they're really good at anything. Actually  I kind of divide the world into two groups now. Jeremy Bentham  the great utilitarian philosopher  once spiked this argument. He said   There are two types of people in this world  those who divide the world into two types and those who do not.  Well  I do. I meet all kinds of people who don't enjoy what they do. They simply go through their lives getting on with it. They get no great pleasure from what they do. They endure it rather than enjoy it  and wait for the weekend. But I also meet people who love what they do and couldn't imagine doing anything else. If you said   Don't do this anymore   they'd wonder what you're talking about. It isn't what they do  it's who they are. They say   But this is me  you know. It would be foolish to abandon this  because it speaks to my most authentic self.  And it's not true of enough people. In fact  on the contrary  I think it's still true of a minority of people. And I think there are many possible explanations for it. And high among them is education  because education  in a way  dislocates very many people from their natural talents. And human resources are like natural resources  they're often buried deep. You have to go looking for them  they're not just lying around on the surface. You have to create the circumstances where they show themselves. And you might imagine education would be the way that happens  but too often  it's not. Every education system in the world is being reformed at the moment and it's not enough. Reform is no use anymore  because that's simply improving a broken model. What we need    and the word's been used many times in the past few days    is not evolution  but a revolution in education. This has to be transformed into something else. One of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally in education. Innovation is hard  because it means doing something that people don't find very easy  for the most part. It means challenging what we take for granted  things that we think are obvious. The great problem for reform or transformation is the tyranny of common sense. Things that people think   It can't be done differently  that's how it's done.  I came across a great quote recently from Abraham Lincoln  who I thought you'd be pleased to have quoted at this point. He said this in December      to the second annual meeting of Congress. I ought to explain that I have no idea what was happening at the time. We don't teach American history in Britain. We suppress it. You know  this is our policy. No doubt  something fascinating was happening then  which the Americans among us will be aware of. But he said this   The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty  and we must rise with the occasion.  I love that. Not rise to it  rise with it.  As our case is new  so we must think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves  and then we shall save our country.  I love that word   disenthrall.  You know what it means  That there are ideas that all of us are enthralled to  which we simply take for granted as the natural order of things  the way things are. And many of our ideas have been formed  not to meet the circumstances of this century  but to cope with the circumstances of previous centuries. But our minds are still hypnotized by them  and we have to disenthrall ourselves of some of them. Now  doing this is easier said than done. It's very hard to know  by the way  what it is you take for granted. And the reason is that you take it for granted. Let me ask you something you may take for granted. How many of you here are over the age of     That's not what you take for granted  I'm sure you're familiar with that. Are there any people here under the age of     Great. Now  those over     could you put your hands up if you're wearing your wristwatch  Now that's a great deal of us  isn't it  Ask a room full of teenagers the same thing. Teenagers do not wear wristwatches. I don't mean they can't  they just often choose not to. And the reason is we were brought up in a pre digital culture  those of us over   . And so for us  if you want to know the time  you have to wear something to tell it. Kids now live in a world which is digitized  and the time  for them  is everywhere. They see no reason to do this. And by the way  you don't need either  it's just that you've always done it and you carry on doing it. My daughter never wears a watch  my daughter Kate  who's   . She doesn't see the point. As she says   It's a single function device.   Like  how lame is that   And I say   No  no  it tells the date as well.   It has multiple functions.  But  you see  there are things we're enthralled to in education. A couple of examples. One of them is the idea of linearity  that it starts here and you go through a track and if you do everything right  you will end up set for the rest of your life. Everybody who's spoken at TED has told us implicitly  or sometimes explicitly  a different story  that life is not linear  it's organic. We create our lives symbiotically as we explore our talents in relation to the circumstances they help to create for us. But  you know  we have become obsessed with this linear narrative. And probably the pinnacle for education is getting you to college. I think we are obsessed with getting people to college. Certain sorts of college. I don't mean you shouldn't go  but not everybody needs to go  or go now. Maybe they go later  not right away. And I was up in San Francisco a while ago doing a book signing. There was this guy buying a book  he was in his   s. I said   What do you do   And he said   I'm a fireman.  I asked   How long have you been a fireman    Always. I've always been a fireman.   Well  when did you decide   He said   As a kid. Actually  it was a problem for me at school  because at school  everybody wanted to be a fireman.  He said   But I wanted to be a fireman.  And he said   When I got to the senior year of school  my teachers didn't take it seriously. This one teacher didn't take it seriously. He said I was throwing my life away if that's all I chose to do with it  that I should go to college  I should become a professional person  that I had great potential and I was wasting my talent to do that.  He said   It was humiliating. It was in front of the whole class and I felt dreadful. But it's what I wanted  and as soon as I left school  I applied to the fire service and I was accepted. You know  I was thinking about that guy recently  just a few minutes ago when you were speaking  about this teacher  because six months ago  I saved his life.  He said   He was in a car wreck  and I pulled him out  gave him CPR  and I saved his wife's life as well.  He said   I think he thinks better of me now.  You know  to me  human communities depend upon a diversity of talent  not a singular conception of ability. And at the heart of our challenges    At the heart of the challenge is to reconstitute our sense of ability and of intelligence. This linearity thing is a problem. When I arrived in L.A. about nine years ago  I came across a policy statement    very well intentioned    which said   College begins in kindergarten.  No  it doesn't. It doesn't. If we had time  I could go into this  but we don't. Kindergarten begins in kindergarten. A friend of mine once said   A three year old is not half a six year old.  They're three. But as we just heard in this last session  there's such competition now to get into kindergarten    to get to the right kindergarten    that people are being interviewed for it at three. Kids sitting in front of unimpressed panels  you know  with their resumes    Flicking through and saying   What  this is it    You've been around for    months  and this is it    You've achieved nothing    commit. Spent the first six months breastfeeding  I can see.  See  it's outrageous as a conception. The other big issue is conformity. We have built our education systems on the model of fast food. This is something Jamie Oliver talked about the other day. There are two models of quality assurance in catering. One is fast food  where everything is standardized. The other is like Zagat and Michelin restaurants  where everything is not standardized  they're customized to local circumstances. And we have sold ourselves into a fast food model of education  and it's impoverishing our spirit and our energies as much as fast food is depleting our physical bodies. We have to recognize a couple of things here. One is that human talent is tremendously diverse. People have very different aptitudes. I worked out recently that I was given a guitar as a kid at about the same time that Eric Clapton got his first guitar. It worked out for Eric  that's all I'm saying. In a way    it did not for me. I could not get this thing to work no matter how often or how hard I blew into it. It just wouldn't work. But it's not only about that. It's about passion. Often  people are good at things they don't really care for. It's about passion  and what excites our spirit and our energy. And if you're doing the thing that you love to do  that you're good at  time takes a different course entirely. My wife's just finished writing a novel  and I think it's a great book  but she disappears for hours on end. You know this  if you're doing something you love  an hour feels like five minutes. If you're doing something that doesn't resonate with your spirit  five minutes feels like an hour. And the reason so many people are opting out of education is because it doesn't feed their spirit  it doesn't feed their energy or their passion. So I think we have to change metaphors. We have to go from what is essentially an industrial model of education  a manufacturing model  which is based on linearity and conformity and batching people. We have to move to a model that is based more on principles of agriculture. We have to recognize that human flourishing is not a mechanical process  it's an organic process. And you cannot predict the outcome of human development. All you can do  like a farmer  is create the conditions under which they will begin to flourish. So when we look at reforming education and transforming it  it isn't like cloning a system. There are great ones  like KIPP's  it's a great system. There are many great models. It's about customizing to your circumstances and personalizing education to the people you're actually teaching. And doing that  I think  is the answer to the future because it's not about scaling a new solution  it's about creating a movement in education in which people develop their own solutions  but with external support based on a personalized curriculum. Now in this room  there are people who represent extraordinary resources in business  in multimedia  in the Internet. These technologies  combined with the extraordinary talents of teachers  provide an opportunity to revolutionize education. And I urge you to get involved in it because it's vital  not just to ourselves  but to the future of our children. But we have to change from the industrial model to an agricultural model  where each school can be flourishing tomorrow. That's where children experience life. Or at home  if that's what they choose  to be educated with their families or friends. There's been a lot of talk about dreams over the course of these few days. And I wanted to just very quickly    I was very struck by Natalie Merchant's songs last night  recovering old poems. I wanted to read you a quick  very short poem from W. B. Yeats  who some of you may know. He wrote this to his love  Maud Gonne  and he was bewailing the fact that he couldn't really give her what he thought she wanted from him. And he says   I've got something else  but it may not be for you.  He says this   Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths  Enwrought with gold and silver light  The blue and the dim and the dark cloths Of night and light and the half light  I would spread the cloths under your feet  But I  being poor  have only my dreams  I have spread my dreams under your feet  Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.  And every day  everywhere  our children spread their dreams beneath our feet. And we should tread softly. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. I heard this amazing story about Miuccia Prada. She's an Italian fashion designer. She goes to this vintage store in Paris with a friend of hers. She's rooting around  she finds this one jacket by Balenciaga    she loves it. She's turning it inside out. She's looking at the seams. She's looking at the construction. Her friend says   Buy it already.  She said   I'll buy it  but I'm also going to replicate it.  Now  the academics in this audience may think   Well  that sounds like plagiarism.  But to a fashionista  what it really is is a sign of Prada's genius  that she can root through the history of fashion and pick the one jacket that doesn't need to be changed by one iota  and to be current and to be now. You might also be asking whether it's possible that this is illegal for her to do this. Well  it turns out that it's actually not illegal. In the fashion industry  there's very little intellectual property protection. They have trademark protection  but no copyright protection and no patent protection to speak of. All they have  really  is trademark protection  and so it means that anybody could copy any garment on any person in this room and sell it as their own design. The only thing that they can't copy is the actual trademark label within that piece of apparel. That's one reason that you see logos splattered all over these products. It's because it's a lot harder for knock off artists to knock off these designs because they can't knock off the logo. But if you go to Santee Alley  yeah. Canal Street  I know. And sometimes these are fun  right  Now  the reason for this  the reason that the fashion industry doesn't have any copyright protection is because the courts decided long ago that apparel is too utilitarian to qualify for copyright protection. They didn't want a handful of designers owning the seminal building blocks of our clothing. And then everybody else would have to license this cuff or this sleeve because Joe Blow owns it. But too utilitarian  I mean is that the way you think of fashion  This is Vivienne Westwood. No  We think of it as maybe too silly  too unnecessary. Now  those of you who are familiar with the logic behind copyright protection    which is that without ownership  there is no incentive to innovate    might be really surprised by both the critical success of the fashion industry and the economic success of this industry. What I'm going to argue today is that because there's no copyright protection in the fashion industry  fashion designers have actually been able to elevate utilitarian design  things to cover our naked bodies  into something that we consider art. Because there's no copyright protection in this industry  there's a very open and creative ecology of creativity. Unlike their creative brothers and sisters  who are sculptors or photographers or filmmakers or musicians  fashion designers can sample from all their peers' designs. They can take any element from any garment from the history of fashion and incorporate it into their own design. They're also notorious for riffing off of the zeitgeist. And here  I suspect  they were influenced by the costumes in Avatar. Maybe just a little. Can't copyright a costume either. Now  fashion designers have the broadest palette imaginable in this creative industry. This wedding dress here is actually made of sporks  and this dress is actually made of aluminum. I've heard this dress actually sort of sounds like wind chimes as they walk through. So  one of the magical side effects of having a culture of copying  which is really what it is  is the establishment of trends. People think this is a magical thing. How does it happen  Well  it's because it's legal for people to copy one another. Some people believe that there are a few people at the top of the fashion food chain who sort of dictate to us what we're all going to wear  but if you talk to any designer at any level  including these high end designers  they always say their main inspiration comes from the street  where people like you and me remix and match our own fashion looks. And that's where they really get a lot of their creative inspiration  so it's both a top down and a bottom up kind of industry. Now  the fast fashion giants have probably benefited the most from the lack of copyright protection in the fashion industry. They are notorious for knocking off high end designs and selling them at very low prices. And they've been faced with a lot of lawsuits  but those lawsuits are usually not won by fashion designers. The courts have said over and over again   You don't need any more intellectual property protection.  When you look at copies like this  you wonder  How do the luxury high end brands remain in business  If you can get it for     bucks  why pay a thousand  Well  that's one reason we had a conference here at USC a few years ago. We invited Tom Ford to come    the conference was called   Ready to Share  Fashion and the Ownership of Creativity     and we asked him exactly this question. Here's what he had to say. He had just come off a successful stint as the lead designer at Gucci  in case you didn't know. Tom Ford  And we found after much research that    actually not much research  quite simple research    that the counterfeit customer was not our customer. Johanna Blakley  Imagine that. The people on Santee Alley are not the ones who shop at Gucci. This is a very different demographic. And  you know  a knock off is never the same as an original high end design  at least in terms of the materials  they're always made of cheaper materials. But even sometimes a cheaper version can actually have some charming aspects  can breathe a little extra life into a dying trend. There's lots of virtues of copying. One that a lot of cultural critics have pointed to is that we now have a much broader palette of design choices to choose from than we ever have before  and this is mainly because of the fast fashion industry  actually. And this is a good thing. We need lots of options. Fashion  whether you like it or not  helps you project who you are to the world. Because of fast fashion  global trends actually get established much more quickly than they used to. And this  actually  is good news to trendsetters  they want trends to be set so that they can move product. For fashionistas  they want to stay ahead of the curve. They don't want to be wearing what everybody else is wearing. And so  they want to move on to the next trend as soon as possible. I tell you  there is no rest for the fashionable. Every season  these designers have to struggle to come up with the new fabulous idea that everybody's going to love. And this  let me tell you  is very good for the bottom line. Now of course  there's a bunch of effects that this culture of copying has on the creative process. And Stuart Weitzman is a very successful shoe designer. He has complained a lot about people copying him  but in one interview I read  he said it has really forced him to up his game. He had to come up with new ideas  new things that would be hard to copy. He came up with this Bowden wedge heel that has to be made out of steel or titanium  if you make it from some sort of cheaper material  it'll actually crack in two. It forced him to be a little more innovative.  Music  And that actually reminded me of jazz great  Charlie Parker. I don't know if you've heard this anecdote  but I have. He said that one of the reasons he invented bebop was that he was pretty sure that white musicians wouldn't be able to replicate the sound.  Laughter  He wanted to make it too difficult to copy  and that's what fashion designers are doing all the time. They're trying to put together a signature look  an aesthetic that reflects who they are. When people knock it off  everybody knows because they've put that look out on the runway  and it's a coherent aesthetic. I love these Gallianos. Okay  we'll move on.  Laughter  This is not unlike the world of comedy. I don't know if you know that jokes also can't be copyright protected. So when one liners were really popular  everybody stole them from one another. But now  we have a different kind of comic. They develop a persona  a signature style  much like fashion designers. And their jokes  much like the fashion designs by a fashion designer  really only work within that aesthetic. If somebody steals a joke from Larry David  for instance  it's not as funny. Now  the other thing that fashion designers have done to survive in this culture of copying is they've learned how to copy themselves. They knock themselves off. They make deals with the fast fashion giants and they come up with a way to sell their product to a whole new demographic  the Santee Alley demographic. Now  some fashion designers will say   It's only in the United States that we don't have any respect. In other countries there is protection for our artful designs.  But if you take a look at the two other biggest markets in the world  it turns out that the protection that's offered is really ineffectual. In Japan  for instance  which I think is the third largest market  they have a design law  it protects apparel  but the novelty standard is so high  you have to prove that your garment has never existed before  it's totally unique. And that's sort of like the novelty standard for a U.S. patent  which fashion designers never get    rarely get here in the states. In the European Union  they went in the other direction. Very low novelty standard  anybody can register anything. But even though it's the home of the fast fashion industry and you have a lot of luxury designers there  they don't register their garments  generally  and there's not a lot of litigation. It turns out it's because the novelty standard is too low. A person can come in and take somebody else's gown  cut off three inches from the bottom  go to the E.U. and register it as a new  original design. So  that does not stop the knock off artists. If you look at the registry  actually  a lot of the registered things in the E.U. are Nike T shirts that are almost identical to one another. But this has not stopped Diane von Furstenberg. She is the head of the Council of Fashion Designers of America  and she has told her constituency that she is going to get copyright protection for fashion designs. The retailers have kind of quashed this notion though. I don't think the legislation is going anywhere  because they realized it is so hard to tell the difference between a pirated design and something that's just part of a global trend. Who owns a look  That is a very difficult question to answer. It takes lots of lawyers and lots of court time  and the retailers decided that would be way too expensive. You know  it's not just the fashion industry that doesn't have copyright protection. There's a bunch of other industries that don't have copyright protection  including the food industry. You cannot copyright a recipe because it's a set of instructions  it's fact  and you cannot copyright the look and feel of even the most unique dish. Same with automobiles. It doesn't matter how wacky they look or how cool they look  you cannot copyright the sculptural design. It's a utilitarian article  that's why. Same with furniture  it's too utilitarian. Magic tricks  I think they're instructions  sort of like recipes  no copyright protection. Hairdos  no copyright protection. Open source software  these guys decided they didn't want copyright protection. They thought it'd be more innovative without it. It's really hard to get copyright for databases. Tattoo artists  they don't want it  it's not cool. They share their designs. Jokes  no copyright protection. Fireworks displays  the rules of games  the smell of perfume  no. And some of these industries may seem sort of marginal to you  but these are the gross sales for low I.P. industries  industries with very little copyright protection  and there's the gross sales of films and books. It ain't pretty. So you talk to people in the fashion industry and they're like   Shhh  Don't tell anybody we can actually steal from each other's designs. It's embarrassing.  But you know what  It's revolutionary  and it's a model that a lot of other industries    like the ones we just saw with the really small bars    they might have to think about this. Because right now  those industries with a lot of copyright protection are operating in an atmosphere where it's as if they don't have any protection  and they don't know what to do. When I found out that there are a whole bunch of industries that didn't have copyright protection  I thought   What exactly is the underlying logic  I want a picture.  And the lawyers do not provide a picture  so I made one. These are the two main sort of binary oppositions within the logic of copyright law. It is more complex than this  but this will do. First  Is something an artistic object  Then it deserves protection. Is it a utilitarian object  Then no  it does not deserve protection. This is a difficult  unstable binary. The other one is  Is it an idea  Is it something that needs to freely circulate in a free society  No protection. Or is it a physically fixed expression of an idea  something that somebody made and they deserve to own it for a while and make money from it  The problem is that digital technology has completely subverted the logic of this physically fixed  expression versus idea concept. Nowadays  we don't really recognize a book as something that sits on our shelf or music as something that is a physical object that we can hold. It's a digital file. It is barely tethered to any sort of physical reality in our minds. And these things  because we can copy and transmit them so easily  actually circulate within our culture a lot more like ideas than like physically instantiated objects. Now  the conceptual issues are truly profound when you talk about creativity and ownership and  let me tell you  we don't want to leave this just to lawyers to figure out. They're smart. I'm with one. He's my boyfriend  he's okay. He's smart  he's smart. But you want an interdisciplinary team of people hashing this out  trying to figure out  What is the kind of ownership model  in a digital world  that's going to lead to the most innovation  And my suggestion is that fashion might be a really good place to start looking for a model for creative industries in the future.

Thank you so much.  Applause  Today  I want you to look at children who become suicide bombers through a completely different lens. In       there were     bomb blasts across Pakistan. I spent the year working with children who were training to become suicide bombers and with Taliban recruiters  trying to understand how the Taliban were converting these children into live ammunition and why these children were actively signing up to their cause. I want you to watch a short video from my latest documentary film   Children of the Taliban.  The Taliban now run their own schools. They target poor families and convince the parents to send their children. In return  they provide free food and shelter and sometimes pay the families a monthly stipend. We've obtained a propaganda video made by the Taliban. Young boys are taught justifications for suicide attacks and the execution of spies. I made contact with a child from Swat who studied in a madrassa like this. Hazrat Ali is from a poor farming family in Swat. He joined the Taliban a year ago when he was   . How do the Taliban in your area get people to join them  Hazrat Ali  They first call us to the mosque and preach to us. Then they take us to a madrassa and teach us things from the Koran. Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy  He tells me that children are then given months of military training. HA  They teach us to use machine guns  Kalashnikov  rocket launchers  grenades  bombs. They ask us to use them only against the infidels. Then they teach us to do a suicide attack. SOC  Would you like to carry out a suicide attack  HA  If God gives me strength. SOC  I  in my research  have seen that the Taliban have perfected the way in which they recruit and train children  and I think it's a five step process. Step one is that the Taliban prey on families that are large  that are poor  that live in rural areas. They separate the parents from the children by promising to provide food  clothing  shelter to these children. Then they ship them off  hundreds of miles away to hard line schools that run along the Taliban agenda. Step two  They teach the children the Koran  which is Islam's holiest book  in Arabic  a language these children do not understand and cannot speak. They rely very heavily on teachers  who I have personally seen distort the message to these children as and when it suits their purpose to. These children are explicitly forbidden from reading newspapers  listening to radio  reading any books that the teachers do not prescribe them. If any child is found violating these rules  he is severely reprimanded. Effectively  the Taliban create a complete blackout of any other source of information for these children. Step three  The Taliban want these children to hate the world that they currently live in. So they beat these children    I have seen it  they feed them twice a day dried bread and water  they rarely allow them to play games  they tell them that  for eight hours at a time  all they have to do is read the Koran. The children are virtual prisoners  they cannot leave  they cannot go home. Their parents are so poor  they have no resources to get them back. Step four  The older members of the Taliban  the fighters  start talking to the younger boys about the glories of martyrdom. They talk to them about how when they die  they will be received up with lakes of honey and milk  how there will be    virgins waiting for them in paradise  how there will be unlimited food  and how this glory is going to propel them to become heroes in their neighborhoods. Effectively  this is the brainwashing process that has begun. Step five  I believe the Taliban have one of the most effective means of propaganda. Their videos that they use are intercut with photographs of men and women and children dying in Iraq and Afghanistan and in Pakistan. And the basic message is that the Western powers do not care about civilian deaths  so those people who live in areas and support governments that work with Western powers are fair game. That's why Pakistani civilians  over       of whom have been killed in the last two years alone  are fair game. Now these children are primed to become suicide bombers. They're ready to go out and fight because they've been told that this is effectively their only way to glorify Islam. I want you to watch another excerpt from the film. This boy is called Zenola. He blew himself up  killing six. This boy is called Sadik. He killed   . This boy is called Messoud. He killed   . The Taliban are running suicide schools  preparing a generation of boys for atrocities against civilians. Do you want to carry out a suicide attack  Boy  I would love to. But only if I get permission from my dad. When I look at suicide bombers younger than me  or my age  I get so inspired by their terrific attacks. SOC  What blessing would you get from carrying out a suicide attack  Boy  On the day of judgment  God will ask me   Why did you do that   I will answer   My Lord  Only to make you happy  I have laid down my life fighting the infidels.  Then God will look at my intention. If my intention was to eradicate evil for Islam  then I will be rewarded with paradise. Singer    On the day of judgment     My God will call me     My body will be put back together     And God will ask me why I did this   SOC  I leave you all with this thought  If you grew up in these circumstances  faced with these choices  would you choose to live in this world or in the glorious afterlife  As one Taliban recruiter told me   There will always be sacrificial lambs in this war.  Thank you. Do you worry about what is going to kill you  Heart disease  cancer  a car accident  Most of us worry about things we can't control  like war  terrorism  the tragic earthquake that just occurred in Haiti. But what really threatens humanity  A few years ago  Professor Vaclav Smil tried to calculate the probability of sudden disasters large enough to change history. He called these   massively fatal discontinuities   meaning that they could kill up to     million people in the next    years. He looked at the odds of another world war  of a massive volcanic eruption  even of an asteroid hitting the Earth. But he placed the likelihood of one such event above all others at close to     percent  and that is a severe flu pandemic. Now  you might think of flu as just a really bad cold  but it can be a death sentence. Every year         people in the United States die of seasonal flu. In the developing world  the data is much sketchier but the death toll is almost certainly higher. You know  the problem is if this virus occasionally mutates so dramatically  it essentially is a new virus and then we get a pandemic. In       a new virus appeared that killed some    to     million people. It spread like wildfire and some died within hours of developing symptoms. Are we safer today  Well  we seem to have dodged the deadly pandemic this year that most of us feared  but this threat could reappear at any time. The good news is that we're at a moment in time when science  technology  globalization is converging to create an unprecedented possibility  the possibility to make history by preventing infectious diseases that still account for one fifth of all deaths and countless misery on Earth. We can do this. We're already preventing millions of deaths with existing vaccines  and if we get these to more people  we can certainly save more lives. But with new or better vaccines for malaria  TB  HIV  pneumonia  diarrhea  flu  we could end suffering that has been on the Earth since the beginning of time. So  I'm here to trumpet vaccines for you. But first  I have to explain why they're important because vaccines  the power of them  is really like a whisper. When they work  they can make history  but after a while you can barely hear them. Now  some of us are old enough to have a small  circular scar on our arms from an inoculation we received as children. But when was the last time you worried about smallpox  a disease that killed half a billion people last century and no longer is with us  Or polio  How many of you remember the iron lung  We don't see scenes like this anymore because of vaccines. Now  it's interesting because there are    odd diseases that can be treated with vaccines now  but we're still threatened by things like HIV and flu. Why is that  Well  here's the dirty little secret. Until recently  we haven't had to know exactly how a vaccine worked. We knew they worked through old fashioned trial and error. You took a pathogen  you modified it  you injected it into a person or an animal and you saw what happened. This worked well for most pathogens  somewhat well for crafty bugs like flu  but not at all for HIV  for which humans have no natural immunity. So let's explore how vaccines work. They basically create a cache of weapons for your immune system which you can deploy when needed. Now  when you get a viral infection  what normally happens is it takes days or weeks for your body to fight back at full strength  and that might be too late. When you're pre immunized  what happens is you have forces in your body pre trained to recognize and defeat specific foes. So that's really how vaccines work. Now  let's take a look at a video that we're debuting at TED  for the first time  on how an effective HIV vaccine might work. Narrator  A vaccine trains the body in advance how to recognize and neutralize a specific invader. After HIV penetrates the body's mucosal barriers  it infects immune cells to replicate. The invader draws the attention of the immune system's front line troops. Dendritic cells  or macrophages  capture the virus and display pieces of it. Memory cells generated by the HIV vaccine are activated when they learn HIV is present from the front line troops. These memory cells immediately deploy the exact weapons needed. Memory B cells turn into plasma cells  which produce wave after wave of the specific antibodies that latch onto HIV to prevent it from infecting cells  while squadrons of killer T cells seek out and destroy cells that are already HIV infected. The virus is defeated. Without a vaccine  these responses would have taken more than a week. By that time  the battle against HIV would already have been lost. Seth Berkley  Really cool video  isn't it  The antibodies you just saw in this video  in action  are the ones that make most vaccines work. So the real question then is  How do we ensure that your body makes the exact ones that we need to protect against flu and HIV  The principal challenge for both of these viruses is that they're always changing. So let's take a look at the flu virus. In this rendering of the flu virus  these different colored spikes are what it uses to infect you. And also  what the antibodies use is a handle to essentially grab and neutralize the virus. When these mutate  they change their shape  and the antibodies don't know what they're looking at anymore. So that's why every year you can catch a slightly different strain of flu. It's also why in the spring  we have to make a best guess at which three strains are going to prevail the next year  put those into a single vaccine and rush those into production for the fall. Even worse  the most common influenza    influenza A    also infects animals that live in close proximity to humans  and they can recombine in those particular animals. In addition  wild aquatic birds carry all known strains of influenza. So  you've got this situation  In       we had an H N  virus that jumped from birds into humans in a few isolated cases with an apparent mortality rate of    percent. Now luckily  that particular virus  although very scary at the time  did not transmit from person to person very easily. This year's H N  threat was actually a human  avian  swine mixture that arose in Mexico. It was easily transmitted  but  luckily  was pretty mild. And so  in a sense  our luck is holding out  but you know  another wild bird could fly over at anytime. Now let's take a look at HIV. As variable as flu is  HIV makes flu look like the Rock of Gibraltar. The virus that causes AIDS is the trickiest pathogen scientists have ever confronted. It mutates furiously  it has decoys to evade the immune system  it attacks the very cells that are trying to fight it and it quickly hides itself in your genome. Here's a slide looking at the genetic variation of flu and comparing that to HIV  a much wilder target. In the video a moment ago  you saw fleets of new viruses launching from infected cells. Now realize that in a recently infected person  there are millions of these ships  each one is just slightly different. Finding a weapon that recognizes and sinks all of them makes the job that much harder. Now  in the    years since HIV was identified as the cause of AIDS  we've developed more drugs to treat HIV than all other viruses put together. These drugs aren't cures  but they represent a huge triumph of science because they take away the automatic death sentence from a diagnosis of HIV  at least for those who can access them. The vaccine effort though is really quite different. Large companies moved away from it because they thought the science was so difficult and vaccines were seen as poor business. Many thought that it was just impossible to make an AIDS vaccine  but today  evidence tells us otherwise. In September  we had surprising but exciting findings from a clinical trial that took place in Thailand. For the first time  we saw an AIDS vaccine work in humans    albeit  quite modestly    and that particular vaccine was made almost a decade ago. Newer concepts and early testing now show even greater promise in the best of our animal models. But in the past few months  researchers have also isolated several new broadly neutralizing antibodies from the blood of an HIV infected individual. Now  what does this mean  We saw earlier that HIV is highly variable  that a broad neutralizing antibody latches on and disables multiple variations of the virus. If you take these and you put them in the best of our monkey models  they provide full protection from infection. In addition  these researchers found a new site on HIV where the antibodies can grab onto  and what's so special about this spot is that it changes very little as the virus mutates. It's like  as many times as the virus changes its clothes  it's still wearing the same socks  and now our job is to make sure we get the body to really hate those socks. So what we've got is a situation. The Thai results tell us we can make an AIDS vaccine  and the antibody findings tell us how we might do that. This strategy  working backwards from an antibody to create a vaccine candidate  has never been done before in vaccine research. It's called retro vaccinology  and its implications extend way beyond that of just HIV. So think of it this way. We've got these new antibodies we've identified  and we know that they latch onto many  many variations of the virus. We know that they have to latch onto a specific part  so if we can figure out the precise structure of that part  present that through a vaccine  what we hope is we can prompt your immune system to make these matching antibodies. And that would create a universal HIV vaccine. Now  it sounds easier than it is because the structure actually looks more like this blue antibody diagram attached to its yellow binding site  and as you can imagine  these three dimensional structures are much harder to work on. And if you guys have ideas to help us solve this  we'd love to hear about it. But  you know  the research that has occurred from HIV now has really helped with innovation with other diseases. So for instance  a biotechnology company has now found broadly neutralizing antibodies to influenza  as well as a new antibody target on the flu virus. They're currently making a cocktail    an antibody cocktail    that can be used to treat severe  overwhelming cases of flu. In the longer term  what they can do is use these tools of retro vaccinology to make a preventive flu vaccine. Now  retro vaccinology is just one technique within the ambit of so called rational vaccine design. Let me give you another example. We talked about before the H and N spikes on the surface of the flu virus. Notice these other  smaller protuberances. These are largely hidden from the immune system. Now it turns out that these spots also don't change much when the virus mutates. If you can cripple these with specific antibodies  you could cripple all versions of the flu. So far  animal tests indicate that such a vaccine could prevent severe disease  although you might get a mild case. So if this works in humans  what we're talking about is a universal flu vaccine  one that doesn't need to change every year and would remove the threat of death. We really could think of flu  then  as just a bad cold. Of course  the best vaccine imaginable is only valuable to the extent we get it to everyone who needs it. So to do that  we have to combine smart vaccine design with smart production methods and  of course  smart delivery methods. So I want you to think back a few months ago. In June  the World Health Organization declared the first global flu pandemic in    years. The U.S. government promised     million doses of vaccine by October   th for the flu peak. Vaccines were promised to developing countries. Hundreds of millions of dollars were spent and flowed to accelerating vaccine manufacturing. So what happened  Well  we first figured out how to make flu vaccines  how to produce them  in the early     s. It was a slow  cumbersome process that depended on chicken eggs  millions of living chicken eggs. Viruses only grow in living things  and so it turned out that  for flu  chicken eggs worked really well. For most strains  you could get one to two doses of vaccine per egg. Luckily for us  we live in an era of breathtaking biomedical advances. So today  we get our flu vaccines from ... chicken eggs  hundreds of millions of chicken eggs. Almost nothing has changed. The system is reliable but the problem is you never know how well a strain is going to grow. This year's swine flu strain grew very poorly in early production  basically .  doses per egg. So  here's an alarming thought. What if that wild bird flies by again  You could see an avian strain that would infect the poultry flocks  and then we would have no eggs for our vaccines. So  Dan  Barber   if you want billions of chicken pellets for your fish farm  I know where to get them. So right now  the world can produce about     million doses of flu vaccine for the three strains  and we can up that to about  .  billion doses if we want to target a single variant like swine flu. But this assumes that our factories are humming because  in       the U.S. supply was cut in half by contamination at one single plant. And the process still takes more than half a year. So are we better prepared than we were in       Well  with the new technologies emerging now  I hope we can say definitively   Yes.  Imagine we could produce enough flu vaccine for everyone in the entire world for less than half of what we're currently spending now in the United States. With a range of new technologies  we could. Here's an example  A company I'm engaged with has found a specific piece of the H spike of flu that sparks the immune system. If you lop this off and attach it to the tail of a different bacterium  which creates a vigorous immune response  they've created a very powerful flu fighter. This vaccine is so small it can be grown in a common bacteria  E. coli. Now  as you know  bacteria reproduce quickly    it's like making yogurt    and so we could produce enough swine origin flu for the entire world in a few factories  in a few weeks  with no eggs  for a fraction of the cost of current methods. So here's a comparison of several of these new vaccine technologies. And  aside from the radically increased production and huge cost savings    for example  the E. coli method I just talked about    look at the time saved  this would be lives saved. The developing world  mostly left out of the current response  sees the potential of these alternate technologies and they're leapfrogging the West. India  Mexico and others are already making experimental flu vaccines  and they may be the first place we see these vaccines in use. Because these technologies are so efficient and relatively cheap  billions of people can have access to lifesaving vaccines if we can figure out how to deliver them. Now think of where this leads us. New infectious diseases appear or reappear every few years. Some day  perhaps soon  we'll have a virus that is going to threaten all of us. Will we be quick enough to react before millions die  Luckily  this year's flu was relatively mild. I say   luckily  in part because virtually no one in the developing world was vaccinated. So if we have the political and financial foresight to sustain our investments  we will master these and new tools of vaccinology  and with these tools we can produce enough vaccine for everyone at low cost and ensure healthy productive lives. No longer must flu have to kill half a million people a year. No longer does AIDS need to kill two million a year. No longer do the poor and vulnerable need to be threatened by infectious diseases  or indeed  anybody. Instead of having Vaclav Smil's  massively fatal discontinuity  of life  we can ensure the continuity of life. What the world needs now are these new vaccines  and we can make it happen. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Thank you. Thank you. So  the science is changing. In your mind  Seth    I mean  you must dream about this    what is the kind of time scale on  let's start with HIV  for a game changing vaccine that's actually out there and usable  SB  The game change can come at any time  because the problem we have now is we've shown we can get a vaccine to work in humans  we just need a better one. And with these types of antibodies  we know humans can make them. So  if we can figure out how to do that  then we have the vaccine  and what's interesting is there already is some evidence that we're beginning to crack that problem. So  the challenge is full speed ahead. CA  In your gut  do you think it's probably going to be at least another five years  SB  You know  everybody says it's    years  but it's been    years every    years. So I hate to put a timeline on scientific innovation  but the investments that have occurred are now paying dividends. CA  And that's the same with universal flu vaccine  the same kind of thing  SB  I think flu is different. I think what happened with flu is we've got a bunch    I just showed some of this    a bunch of really cool and useful technologies that are ready to go now. They look good. The problem has been that  what we did is we invested in traditional technologies because that's what we were comfortable with. You also can use adjuvants  which are chemicals you mix. That's what Europe is doing  so we could have diluted out our supply of flu and made more available  but  going back to what Michael Specter said  the anti vaccine crowd didn't really want that to happen. CA  And malaria's even further behind  SB  No  malaria  there is a candidate that actually showed efficacy in an earlier trial and is currently in phase three trials now. It probably isn't the perfect vaccine  but it's moving along. CA  Seth  most of us do work where every month  we produce something  we get that kind of gratification. You've been slaving away at this for more than a decade  and I salute you and your colleagues for what you do. The world needs people like you. Thank you. SB  Thank you. I want to talk about what we learn from conservatives. And I'm at a stage in life where I'm yearning for my old days  so I want to confess to you that when I was a kid  indeed  I was a conservative. I was a Young Republican  a Teenage Republican  a leader in the Teenage Republicans. Indeed  I was the youngest member of any delegation in the      convention that elected Ronald Reagan to be the Republican nominee for president. Now  I know what you're thinking. You're thinking   That's not what the Internets say.  You're thinking   Wikipedia doesn't say this fact.  And indeed  this is just one of the examples of the junk that flows across the tubes in these Internets here. Wikipedia reports that this guy  this former congressman from Erie  Pennsylvania was  at the age of     one of the youngest people at the Republican National Convention  but it's just not true. Indeed  it drives me so nuts  let me just change this little fact here. All right. Okay  so ... perfect. Perfect. Okay  speaker Lawrence Lessig  right. Okay. Finally  truth will be brought here. Okay  see  It's done. It's almost done. Here we go.  ... Youngest Republican   okay  we're finished. That's it. Please save this. Great  here we go. And ... Wikipedia is fixed  finally. Okay  but no  this is really besides the point. But the thing I want you to think about when we think about conservatives    not so much this issue of the      convention    the thing to think about is this  They go to church. Now  you know  I mean  a lot of people go to church. I'm not talking about that only conservatives go to church. And I'm not talking about the God thing. I don't want to get into that  you know  that's not my point. They go to church  by which I mean  they do lots of things for free for each other. They hold potluck dinners. Indeed  they sell books about potluck dinners. They serve food to poor people. They share  they give  they give away for free. And it's the very same people leading Wall Street firms who  on Sundays  show up and share. And not only food  right. These very same people are strong believers  in lots of contexts  in the limits on the markets. They are in many important places against markets. Indeed  they  like all of us  celebrate this kind of relationship. But they're very keen that we don't let money drop into that relationship  else it turns into something like this. They want to regulate us  those conservatives  to stop us from allowing the market to spread in those places. Because they understand  There are places for the market and places where the market should not exist  where we should be free to enjoy the fellowship of others. They recognize  Both of these things have to live together. And the second great thing about conservatives  they get ecology. Right  it was the first great Republican president of the   th century who taught us about environmental thinking    Teddy Roosevelt. They first taught us about ecology in the context of natural resources. And then they began to teach us in the context of innovation  economics. They understand  in that context   free.  They understand  free  is an important essential part of the cultural ecology as well. That's the thing I want you to think about them. Now  I know you don't believe me  really  here. So here's exhibit number one. I want to share with you my latest hero  Julian Sanchez  a libertarian who works at the  for many people   evil  Cato Institute. Okay  so Julian made this video. He's a terrible producer of videos  but it's great content  so I'm going to give you a little bit of it. So here he is beginning. Julian Sanchez  I'm going to make an observation about the way remix culture seems to be evolving ... Larry Lessig  So what he does is he begins to tell us about these three videos. This is this fantastic Brat Pack remix set to Lisztomania. Which  of course  spread virally. Hugely successful. And then some people from Brooklyn saw it. They decided they wanted to do the same. And then  of course  people from San Fransisco saw it. And San Franciscans thought they had to do the same as well. And so they're beautiful  but this libertarian has some important lessons he wants us to learn from this. Here's lesson number one. JS  There's obviously also something really deeply great about this. They are acting in the sense that they're emulating the original mashup. And the guy who shot it obviously has a strong eye and some experience with video editing. But this is also basically just a group of friends having an authentic social moment and screwing around together. It should feel familiar and kind of resonate for anyone who's had a sing a long or a dance party with a group of good friends. LL  Or ... JS  So that's importantly different from the earlier videos we looked at because here  remix isn't just about an individual doing something alone in his basement  it becomes an act of social creativity. And it's not just that it yields a different kind of product at the end  it's that potentially it changes the way that we relate to each other. All of our normal social interactions become a kind of invitation to this sort of collective expression. It's our real social lives themselves that are transmuted into art. LL  And so then  what this libertarian draws from these two points ... JS  One remix is about individuals using our shared culture as a kind of language to communicate something to an audience. Stage two  social remix  is really about using it to mediate people's relationships to each other. First  within each video  the Brat Pack characters are used as a kind of template for performing the social reality of each group. But there's also a dialogue between the videos  where  once the basic structure is established  it becomes a kind of platform for articulating the similarities and differences between the groups' social and physical worlds. LL  And then  here's for me  the critical key to what Julian has to say ... JS  Copyright policy isn't just about how to incentivize the production of a certain kind of artistic commodity  it's about what level of control we're going to permit to be exercised over our social realities    social realities that are now inevitably permeated by pop culture. I think it's important that we keep these two different kinds of public goods in mind. If we're only focused on how to maximize the supply of one  I think we risk suppressing this different and richer and  in some ways  maybe even more important one. LL  Right. Bingo. Point. Freedom needs this opportunity to both have the commercial success of the great commercial works and the opportunity to build this different kind of culture. And for that to happen  you need ideas like fair use to be central and protected  to enable this kind of innovation  as this libertarian tells us  between these two creative cultures  a commercial and a sharing culture. The point is they  he  here  gets that culture. Now  my concern is  we Dems  too often  not so much. All right  take for example this great company. In the good old days when this Republican ran that company  their greatest work was work that built on the past  right. All of the great Disney works were works that took works that were in the public domain and remixed them  or waited until they entered the public domain to remix them  to celebrate this add on remix creativity. Indeed  Mickey Mouse himself  of course  as  Steamboat Willie   is a remix of the then  very dominant  very popular  Steamboat Bill  by Buster Keaton. This man was a remixer extraordinaire. He is the celebration and ideal of exactly this kind of creativity. But then the company passes through this dark stage to this Democrat. Wildly different. This is the mastermind behind the eventual passage of what we call the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act  extending the term of existing copyrights by    years  so that no one could do to Disney what Disney did to the Brothers Grimm. Now  when we tried to challenge this  going to the Supreme Court  getting the Supreme Court  the bunch of conservatives there    if we could get them to wake up to this    to strike it down  we had the assistance of Nobel Prize winners including this right wing Nobel Prize winner  Milton Friedman  who said he would join our brief only if the word  no brainer  was in the brief somewhere. But apparently  no brains existed in this place when Democrats passed and signed this bill into law. Now  tiny little quibble of a footnote  Sonny Bono  you might say  was a Republican  but I don't buy it. This guy is no Republican. Okay  for a second example  think about this cultural hero  icon on the Left  creator of this character. Look at the site that he built   Star Wars  MashUps  inviting people to come and use their creative energy to produce a new generation of attention towards this extraordinarily important cultural icon. Read the license. The license for these remixers assigns all of the rights to the remix back to Lucas. The mashup is owned by Lucas. Indeed  anything you add to the mashup  music you might add  Lucas has a worldwide perpetual right to exploit that for free. There is no creator here to be recognized. The creator doesn't have any rights. The creator is a sharecropper in this story. And we should remember who employed the sharecroppers  the Democrats  right  So the point is the Republicans here recognize that there's a certain need of ownership  a respect for ownership  the respect we should give the creator  the remixer  the owner  the property owner  the copyright owner of this extraordinarily powerful stuff  and not a generation of sharecroppers. Now  I think there are lessons we should learn here  lessons about openness. Our lives are sharing activities  at least in part. Even for the head of Goldman Sachs  at least in part. And for that sharing activity to happen  we have to have well protected spaces of fair use. That's number one. Number two  This ecology of sharing needs freedom within which to create. Freedom  which means without permission from anyone  the ability to create. And number three  We need to respect the creator  the creator of these remixes through rights that are directly tied to them. Now  this explains the right wing nonprofit Creative Commons. Actually  it's not a right wing nonprofit  but of course    let me just tie it here    the Creative Commons  which is offering authors this simple way to mark their content with the freedoms they intended to carry. So that we go from a  all rights reserved  world to a  some rights reserved  world so that people can know the freedoms they have attached to the content  building and creating on the basis of this creative copyrighted work. These tools that we built enable this sharing in parts through licenses that make it clear and a freedom to create without requiring permission first because the permission has already been granted and a respect for the creator because it builds upon a copyright the creator has licensed freely. And it explains the vast right wing conspiracy that's obviously developed around these licenses  as now more than     million digital objects are out there  licensed freely in this way. Now that picture of an ecology of creativity  the picture of an ecology of balanced creativity  is that the ecology of creativity we have right now  Well  as you all know  not many of us believe we do. I tripped on the reality of this ecology of creativity just last week. I created a video which was based on a Wireside Chat that I'd given  and I uploaded it to YouTube. I then got this email from YouTube weirdly notifying me that there was content in that owned by the mysterious WMG that matched their content ID. So I didn't think much about it. And then on Twitter  somebody said to me   Your talk on YouTube was DMCA'd. Was that your purpose   imagining that I had this deep conspiracy to reveal the obvious flaws in the DMCA. I answered   No.  I didn't even think about it. But then I went to the site and all of the audio in my site had been silenced. My whole    minute video had been silenced because there were snippets in that video  a video about fair use  that included Warner Music Group music. Now  interestingly  they still sold ads for that music  if you played the silent video. You could still buy the music  but you couldn't hear anything because it had been silenced. So I did what the current regime says I must do to be free to use YouTube to talk about fair use. I went to this site  and I had to answer these questions. And then in an extraordinarily Bart Simpson like  juvenile way you've actually got to type out these words and get them right to reassert your freedom to speak. And I felt like I was in third grade again.  I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair. I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair.  This is absurd. It is outrageous. It is an extraordinary perversion of the system of freedom we should be encouraging. And the question I ask you is  Who's fighting it  Well  interestingly  in the last presidential election  who was the number one  active opponent of this system of regulation in online speech  John McCain. Letter after letter attacking YouTube's refusal to be more respectful of fair use with their extraordinary notice and take down system  that led his campaign so many times to be thrown off the Internet. Now  that was the story of me then  my good old days of right wing lunacy. Let me come back to now  now when I'm a little leftist    I'm certainly left handed  so at least a lefty    And I wonder  can we on the Left expect to build this ecology of freedom  now  in a world where we know the extraordinarily powerful influences against it  where even icons of the Left like this entertain and push bills that would effectively ban the requirement of open access for government funded research  The president  who has supported a process that secretly negotiates agreements  which effectively lock us into the insane system of DMCA that we have adopted and likely lock us down a path of three strikes  you're out that  of course  the rest of the world are increasingly adopting. Not a single example of reform has been produced yet. And we're not going to see this change in this system anytime soon. So here's the lessons of openness that I think we need to learn. Openness is a commitment to a certain set of values. We need to speak of those values. The value of freedom. It's a value of community. It's a value of the limits in regulation. It's a value respecting the creator. Now  if we can learn those values from at least some influences on the Right  if we can take them and incorporate them  maybe we could do a little trade. We learn those values on the Left  and maybe they'll do health care or global warming legislation or something in the Right. Anyway  please join me in teaching these values. Thank you very much. We're        years after the advent of the Macintosh  which was an astoundingly seminal event in the history of human machine interface and in computation in general. It fundamentally changed the way that people thought about computation  thought about computers  how they used them and who and how many people were able to use them. It was such a radical change  in fact  that the early Macintosh development team in '    '    '   had to write an entirely new operating system from the ground up. Now  this is an interesting little message  and it's a lesson that has since  I think  been forgotten or lost or something  and that is  namely  that the OS is the interface. The interface is the OS. It's like the land and the king  i.e. Arthur  they're inseparable  they are one. And to write a new operating system was not a capricious matter. It wasn't just a matter of tuning up some graphics routines. There were no graphics routines. There were no mouse drivers. So it was a necessity. But in the quarter century since then  we've seen all of the fundamental supporting technologies go berserk. So memory capacity and disk capacity have been multiplied by something between        and a million. Same thing for processor speeds. Networks  we didn't have networks at all at the time of the Macintosh's introduction  and that has become the single most salient aspect of how we live with computers. And  of course  graphics  Today    dollars and    cents at Best Buy buys you more graphics power than you could have gotten for a million bucks from SGI only a decade ago. So we've got that incredible ramp up. Then  on the side  we've got the Web and  increasingly  the cloud  which is fantastic  but also    in the regard in which an interface is fundamental    kind of a distraction. So we've forgotten to invent new interfaces. Certainly we've seen in recent years a lot of change in that regard  and people are starting to wake up about that. So what happens next  Where do we go from there  The problem  as we see it  has to do with a single  simple word   space   or a single  simple phrase   real world geometry.  Computers and the programming languages that we talk to them in  that we teach them in  are hideously insensate when it comes to space. They don't understand real world space. It's a funny thing because the rest of us occupy it quite frequently and quite well. They also don't understand time  but that's a matter for a separate talk. So what happens if you start to explain space to them  One thing you might get is something like the Luminous Room. The Luminous Room is a system in which it's considered that input and output spaces are co located. That's a strangely simple  and yet unexplored idea  right  When you use a mouse  your hand is down here on the mouse pad. It's not even on the same plane as what you're talking about  The pixels are up on the display. So here was a room in which all the walls  floors  ceilings  pets  potted plants  whatever was in there  were capable  not only of display but of sensing as well. And that means input and output are in the same space enabling stuff like this. That's a digital storage in a physical container. The contract is the same as with real word objects in real world containers. Has to come back out  whatever you put in. This little design experiment that was a small office here knew a few other tricks as well. If you presented it with a chess board  it tried to figure out what you might mean by that. And if there was nothing for them to do  the chess pieces eventually got bored and hopped away. The academics who were overseeing this work thought that that was too frivolous  so we built deadly serious applications like this optics prototyping workbench in which a toothpaste cap on a cardboard box becomes a laser. The beam splitters and lenses are represented by physical objects  and the system projects down the laser beam path. So you've got an interface that has no interface. You operate the world as you operate the real world  which is to say  with your hands. Similarly  a digital wind tunnel with digital wind flowing from right to left    not that remarkable in a sense  we didn't invent the mathematics. But if you displayed that on a CRT or flat panel display  it would be meaningless to hold up an arbitrary object  a real world object in that. Here  the real world merges with the simulation. And finally  to pull out all the stops  this is a system called Urp  for urban planners  in which we give architects and urban planners back the models that we confiscated when we insisted that they use CAD systems. And we make the machine meet them half way. It projects down digital shadows  as you see here. And if you introduce tools like this inverse clock  then you can control the sun's position in the sky. That's   a.m. shadows. They get a little shorter at   a.m. There you are  swinging the sun around. Short shadows at noon and so forth. And we built up a series of tools like this. There are inter shadowing studies that children can operate  even though they don't know anything about urban planning  To move a building  you simply reach out your hand and you move the building. A material wand makes the building into a sort of Frank Gehry thing that reflects light in all directions. Are you blinding passers by and motorists on the freeways  A zoning tool connects distant structures  a building and a roadway. Are you going to get sued by the zoning commission  And so forth. Now  if these ideas seem familiar or perhaps even a little dated  that's great  they should seem familiar. This work is    years old. This stuff was undertaken at MIT and the Media Lab under the incredible direction of Professor Hiroshi Ishii  director of the Tangible Media Group. But it was that work that was seen by Alex McDowell  one of the world's legendary production designers. But Alex was preparing a little  sort of obscure  indie  arthouse film called  Minority Report  for Steven Spielberg  and invited us to come out from MIT and design the interfaces that would appear in that film. And the great thing about it was that Alex was so dedicated to the idea of verisimilitude  the idea that the putative      that we were painting in the film be believable  that he allowed us to take on that design work as if it were an R D effort. And the result is sort of gratifyingly perpetual. People still reference those sequences in  Minority Report  when they talk about new UI design. So this led full circle  in a strange way  to build these ideas into what we believe is the necessary future of human machine interface  the Spatial Operating Environment  we call it. So here we have a bunch of stuff  some images. And  using a hand  we can actually exercise six degrees of freedom  six degrees of navigational control. And it's fun to fly through Mr. Beckett's eye. And you can come back out through the scary orangutan. And that's all well and good. Let's do something a little more difficult. Here  we have a whole bunch of disparate images. We can fly around them. So navigation is a fundamental issue. You have to be able to navigate in  D. Much of what we want computers to help us with in the first place is inherently spatial. And the part that isn't spatial can often be spatialized to allow our wetware to make greater sense of it. Now we can distribute this stuff in many different ways. So we can throw it out like that. Let's reset it. We can organize it this way. And  of course  it's not just about navigation  but about manipulation as well. So if we don't like stuff  or we're intensely curious about Ernst Haeckel's scientific falsifications  we can pull them out like that. And then if it's time for analysis  we can pull back a little bit and ask for a different distribution. Let's just come down a bit and fly around. So that's a different way to look at stuff. If you're of a more analytical nature then you might want  actually  to look at this as a color histogram. So now we've got the stuff color sorted  angle maps onto color. And now  if we want to select stuff   D  space  the idea that we're tracking hands in real space becomes really important because we can reach in  not in  D  not in fake  D  but in actual  D. Here are some selection planes. And we'll perform this Boolean operation because we really love yellow and tapirs on green grass. So  from there to the world of real work. Here's a logistics system  a small piece of one that we're currently building. There're a lot of elements. And one thing that's very important is to combine traditional tabular data with three dimensional and geospatial information. So here's a familiar place. And we'll bring this back here for a second. Maybe select a little bit of that. And bring out this graph. And we should  now  be able to fly in here and have a closer look. These are logistics elements that are scattered across the United States. One thing that three dimensional interactions and the general idea of imbuing computation with space affords you is a final destruction of that unfortunate one to one pairing between human beings and computers. That's the old way  that's the old mantra  one machine  one human  one mouse  one screen. Well  that doesn't really cut it anymore. In the real world  we have people who collaborate  we have people who have to work together  and we have many different displays. And we might want to look at these various images. We might want to ask for some help. The author of this new pointing device is sitting over there  so I can pull this from there to there. These are unrelated machines  right  So the computation is space soluble and network soluble. So I'm going to leave that over there because I have a question for Paul. Paul is the designer of this wand  and maybe its easiest for him to come over here and tell me in person what's going on. So let me get some of these out of the way. Let's pull this apart  I'll go ahead and explode it. Kevin  can you help  Let me see if I can help us find the circuit board. Mind you  it's a sort of gratuitous field stripping exercise  but we do it in the lab all the time. All right. So collaborative work  whether it's immediately co located or distant and distinct  is always important. And again  that stuff needs to be undertaken in the context of space. And finally  I'd like to leave you with a glimpse that takes us back to the world of imagery. This is a system called TAMPER  which is a slightly whimsical look at what the future of editing and media manipulation systems might be. We at Oblong believe that media should be accessible in much more fine grained form. So we have a large number of movies stuck inside here. And let's just pick out a few elements. We can zip through them as a possibility. We can grab elements off the front  where upon they reanimate  come to life  and drag them down onto the table here. We'll go over to Jacques Tati here and grab our blue friend and put him down on the table as well. We may need more than one. And we probably need  well  we probably need a cowboy to be quite honest. Yeah  let's take that one. You see  cowboys and French farce people don't go well together  and the system knows that. Let me leave with one final thought  and that is that one of the greatest English language writers of the last three decades suggested that great art is always a gift. And he wasn't talking about whether the novel costs   .    dollars   or whether you have to spring    million bucks to buy the stolen Vermeer  he was talking about the circumstances of its creation and of its existence. And I think that it's time that we asked for the same from technology. Technology is capable of expressing and being imbued with a certain generosity  and we need to demand that  in fact. For some of this kind of technology  ground center is a combination of design  which is crucially important. We can't have advances in technology any longer unless design is integrated from the very start. And  as well  as of efficacy  agency. We're  as human beings  the creatures that create  and we should make sure that our machines aid us in that task and are built in that same image. So I will leave you with that. Thank you. Chris Anderson  So to ask the obvious question    actually this is from Bill Gates    when   John Underkoffler  When   CA  When real  When for us  not just in a lab and on a stage  Can it be for every man  or is this just for corporations and movie producers  JU  No  it has to be for every human being. That's our goal entirely. We won't have succeeded unless we take that next big step. I mean it's been    years. Can there really be only one interface  There can't. CA  But does that mean that  at your desk or in your home  you need projectors  cameras  You know  how can it work  JU  No  this stuff will be built into the bezel of every display. It'll be built into architecture. The gloves go away in a matter of months or years. So this is the inevitability about it. CA  So  in your mind  five years time  someone can buy this as part of a standard computer interface  JU  I think in five years time when you buy a computer  you'll get this. CA  Well that's cool. The world has a habit of surprising us as to how these things are actually used. What do you think  what in your mind is the first killer app for this  JU  That's a good question  and we ask ourselves that every day. At the moment  our early adopter customers    and these systems are deployed out in the real world    do all the big data intensive  data heavy problems with it. So  whether it's logistics and supply chain management or natural gas and resource extraction  financial services  pharmaceuticals  bioinformatics  those are the topics right now  but that's not a killer app. And I understand what you're asking. CA  C'mon  c'mon. Martial arts  games. C'mon. John  thank you for making science fiction real. JU  It's been a great pleasure. Thank you to you all. I would like to share with you this morning some stories about the ocean through my work as a still photographer for National Geographic magazine. I guess I became an underwater photographer and a photojournalist because I fell in love with the sea as a child. And I wanted to tell stories about all the amazing things I was seeing underwater  incredible wildlife and interesting behaviors. And after even    years of doing this  after    years of exploring the ocean  I never cease to be amazed at the extraordinary encounters that I have while I'm at sea. But more and more frequently these days I'm seeing terrible things underwater as well  things that I don't think most people realize. And I've been compelled to turn my camera towards these issues to tell a more complete story. I want people to see what's happening underwater  both the horror and the magic. The first story that I did for National Geographic  where I recognized the ability to include environmental issues within a natural history coverage  was a story I proposed on harp seals. The story I wanted to do initially was just a small focus to look at the few weeks each year where these animals migrate down from the Canadian arctic to the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada to engage in courtship  mating and to have their pups. And all of this is played out against the backdrop of transient pack ice that moves with wind and tide. And because I'm an underwater photographer  I wanted to do this story from both above and below  to make pictures like this that show one of these little pups making its very first swim in the icy    degree water. But as I got more involved in the story  I realized that there were two big environmental issues I couldn't ignore. The first was that these animals continue to be hunted  killed with hakapiks at about eight     days old. It actually is the largest marine mammal slaughter on the planet  with hundreds of thousands of these seals being killed every year. But as disturbing as that is  I think the bigger problem for harp seals is the loss of sea ice due to global warming. This is an aerial picture that I made that shows the Gulf of St. Lawrence during harp seal season. And even though we see a lot of ice in this picture  there's a lot of water as well  which wasn't there historically. And the ice that is there is quite thin. The problem is that these pups need a stable platform of solid ice in order to nurse from their moms. They only need    days from the moment they're born until they're on their own. But if they don't get    days  they can fall into the ocean and die. This is a photo that I made showing one of these pups that's only about five or seven days old    still has a little bit of the umbilical cord on its belly    that has fallen in because of the thin ice  and the mother is frantically trying to push it up to breathe and to get it back to stable purchase. This problem has continued to grow each year since I was there. I read that last year the pup mortality rate was     percent in parts of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. So  clearly  this species has a lot of problems going forward. This ended up becoming a cover story at National Geographic. And it received quite a bit of attention. And with that  I saw the potential to begin doing other stories about ocean problems. So I proposed a story on the global fish crisis  in part because I had personally witnessed a lot of degradation in the ocean over the last    years  but also because I read a scientific paper that stated that    percent of the big fish in the ocean have disappeared in the last    or    years. These are the tuna  the billfish and the sharks. When I read that  I was blown away by those numbers. I thought this was going to be headline news in every media outlet  but it really wasn't  so I wanted to do a story that was a very different kind of underwater story. I wanted it to be more like war photography  where I was making harder hitting pictures that showed readers what was happening to marine wildlife around the planet. The first component of the story that I thought was essential  however  was to give readers a sense of appreciation for the ocean animals that they were eating. You know  I think people go into a restaurant  and somebody orders a steak  and we all know where steak comes from  and somebody orders a chicken  and we know what a chicken is  but when they're eating bluefin sushi  do they have any sense of the magnificent animal that they're consuming  These are the lions and tigers of the sea. In reality  these animals have no terrestrial counterpart  they're unique in the world. These are animals that can practically swim from the equator to the poles and can crisscross entire oceans in the course of a year. If we weren't so efficient at catching them  because they grow their entire life  would have    year old bluefin out there that weigh a ton. But the truth is we're way too efficient at catching them  and their stocks have collapsed worldwide. This is the daily auction at the Tsukiji Fish Market that I photographed a couple years ago. And every single day these tuna  bluefin like this  are stacked up like cordwood  just warehouse after warehouse. As I wandered around and made these pictures  it sort of occurred to me that the ocean's not a grocery store  you know. We can't keep taking without expecting serious consequences as a result. I also  with the story  wanted to show readers how fish are caught  some of the methods that are used to catch fish  like a bottom trawler  which is one of the most common methods in the world. This was a small net that was being used in Mexico to catch shrimp  but the way it works is essentially the same everywhere in the world. You have a large net in the middle with two steel doors on either end. And as this assembly is towed through the water  the doors meet resistance with the ocean  and it opens the mouth of the net  and they place floats at the top and a lead line on the bottom. And this just drags over the bottom  in this case to catch shrimp. But as you can imagine  it's catching everything else in its path as well. And it's destroying that precious benthic community on the bottom  things like sponges and corals  that critical habitat for other animals. This photograph I made of the fisherman holding the shrimp that he caught after towing his nets for one hour. So he had a handful of shrimp  maybe seven or eight shrimp  and all those other animals on the deck of the boat are bycatch. These are animals that died in the process  but have no commercial value. So this is the true cost of a shrimp dinner  maybe seven or eight shrimp and    pounds of other animals that had to die in the process. And to make that point even more visual  I swam under the shrimp boat and made this picture of the guy shoveling this bycatch into the sea as trash and photographed this cascade of death  you know  animals like guitarfish  bat rays  flounder  pufferfish  that only an hour before  were on the bottom of the ocean  alive  but now being thrown back as trash. I also wanted to focus on the shark fishing industry because  currently on planet Earth  we're killing over     million sharks every single year. But before I went out to photograph this component  I sort of wrestled with the notion of how do you make a picture of a dead shark that will resonate with readers You know  I think there's still a lot of people out there who think the only good shark is a dead shark. But this one morning I jumped in and found this thresher that had just recently died in the gill net. And with its huge pectoral fins and eyes still very visible  it struck me as sort of a crucifixion  if you will. This ended up being the lead picture in the global fishery story in National Geographic. And I hope that it helped readers to take notice of this problem of     million sharks. And because I love sharks    I'm somewhat obsessed with sharks    I wanted to do another  more celebratory  story about sharks  as a way of talking about the need for shark conservation. So I went to the Bahamas because there're very few places in the world where sharks are doing well these days  but the Bahamas seem to be a place where stocks were reasonably healthy  largely due to the fact that the government there had outlawed longlining several years ago. And I wanted to show several species that we hadn't shown much in the magazine and worked in a number of locations. One of the locations was this place called Tiger Beach  in the northern Bahamas where tiger sharks aggregate in shallow water. This is a low altitude photograph that I made showing our dive boat with about a dozen of these big old tiger sharks sort of just swimming around behind. But the one thing I definitely didn't want to do with this coverage was to continue to portray sharks as something like monsters. I didn't want them to be overly threatening or scary. And with this photograph of a beautiful    feet  probably    feet  I guess  female tiger shark  I sort of think I got to that goal  where she was swimming with these little barjacks off her nose  and my strobe created a shadow on her face. And I think it's a gentler picture  a little less threatening  a little more respectful of the species. I also searched on this story for the elusive great hammerhead  an animal that really hadn't been photographed much until maybe about seven or    years ago. It's a very solitary creature. But this is an animal that's considered data deficient by science in both Florida and in the Bahamas. You know  we know almost nothing about them. We don't know where they migrate to or from  where they mate  where they have their pups  and yet  hammerhead populations in the Atlantic have declined about    percent in the last    to    years. You know  we're losing them faster than we can possibly find them. This is the oceanic whitetip shark  an animal that is considered the fourth most dangerous species  if you pay attention to such lists. But it's an animal that's about    percent in decline throughout most of its range. Because this is a pelagic animal and it lives out in the deeper water  and because we weren't working on the bottom  I brought along a shark cage here  and my friend  shark biologist Wes Pratt is inside the cage. You'll see that the photographer  of course  was not inside the cage here  so clearly the biologist is a little smarter than the photographer I guess. And lastly with this story  I also wanted to focus on baby sharks  shark nurseries. And I went to the island of Bimini  in the Bahamas  to work with lemon shark pups. This is a photo of a lemon shark pup  and it shows these animals where they live for the first two to three years of their lives in these protective mangroves. This is a very sort of un shark like photograph. It's not what you typically might think of as a shark picture. But  you know  here we see a shark that's maybe    or    inches long swimming in about a foot of water. But this is crucial habitat and it's where they spend the first two  three years of their lives  until they're big enough to go out on the rest of the reef. After I left Bimini  I actually learned that this habitat was being bulldozed to create a new golf course and resort. And other recent stories have looked at single  flagship species  if you will  that are at risk in the ocean as a way of talking about other threats. One such story I did documented the leatherback sea turtle. This is the largest  widest ranging  deepest diving and oldest of all turtle species. Here we see a female crawling out of the ocean under moonlight on the island of Trinidad. These are animals whose lineage dates back about     million years. And there was a time in their lifespan where they were coming out of the water to nest and saw Tyrannosaurus rex running by. And today  they crawl out and see condominiums. But despite this amazing longevity  they're now considered critically endangered. In the Pacific  where I made this photograph  their stocks have declined about    percent in the last    years. This is a photograph that shows a hatchling about to taste saltwater for the very first time beginning this long and perilous journey. Only one in a thousand leatherback hatchlings will reach maturity. But that's due to natural predators like vultures that pick them off on a beach or predatory fish that are waiting offshore. Nature has learned to compensate with that  and females have multiple clutches of eggs to overcome those odds. But what they can't deal with is anthropogenic stresses  human things  like this picture that shows a leatherback caught at night in a gill net. I actually jumped in and photographed this  and with the fisherman's permission  I cut the turtle out  and it was able to swim free. But  you know  thousands of other leatherbacks each year are not so fortunate  and the species' future is in great danger. Another charismatic megafauna species that I worked with is the story I did on the right whale. And essentially  the story is this with right whales  that about a million years ago  there was one species of right whale on the planet  but as land masses moved around and oceans became isolated  the species sort of separated  and today we have essentially two distinct stocks. We have the Southern right whale that we see here and the North Atlantic right whale that we see here with a mom and calf off the coast of Florida. Now  both species were hunted to the brink of extinction by the early whalers  but the Southern right whales have rebounded a lot better because they're located in places farther away from human activity. The North Atlantic right whale is listed as the most endangered species on the planet today because they are urban whales  they live along the east coast of North America  United States and Canada  and they have to deal with all these urban ills. This photo shows an animal popping its head out at sunset off the coast of Florida. You can see the coal burning plant in the background. They have to deal with things like toxins and pharmaceuticals that are flushed out into the ocean  and maybe even affecting their reproduction. They also get entangled in fishing gear. This is a picture that shows the tail of a right whale. And those white markings are not natural markings. These are entanglement scars.    percent of the population has such scars  but most don't shed the gear  things like lobster traps and crab pots. They hold on to them  and it eventually kills them. And the other problem is they get hit by ships. And this was an animal that was struck by a ship in Nova Scotia  Canada being towed in  where they did a necropsy to confirm the cause of death  which was indeed a ship strike. So all of these ills are stacking up against these animals and keeping their numbers very low. And to draw a contrast with that beleaguered North Atlantic population  I went to a new pristine population of Southern right whales that had only been discovered about    years ago in the sub Antarctic of New Zealand  a place called the Auckland Islands. I went down there in the winter time. And these are animals that had never seen humans before  and I was one of the first people they probably had ever seen. And I got in the water with them  and I was amazed at how curious they were. This photograph shows my assistant standing on the bottom at about    feet and one of these amazingly beautiful     foot     ton whales  like a city bus just swimming up  you know. They were in perfect condition  very fat and healthy  robust  no entanglement scars  the way they're supposed to look. You know  I read that the pilgrims  when they landed at Plymouth Rock in Massachusetts in       wrote that you could walk across Cape Cod Bay on the backs of right whales. And we can't go back and see that today  but maybe we can preserve what we have left. And I wanted to close this program with a story of hope  a story I did on marine reserves as sort of a solution to the problem of overfishing  the global fish crisis story. I settled on working in the country of New Zealand because New Zealand was rather progressive  and is rather progressive in terms of protecting their ocean. And I really wanted this story to be about three things  I wanted it to be about abundance  about diversity and about resilience. And one of the first places I worked was a reserve called Goat Island in Leigh of New Zealand. What the scientists there told me was that when protected this first marine reserve in       they hoped and expected that certain things might happen. For example  they hoped that certain species of fish like the New Zealand snapper would return because they had been fished to the brink of commercial extinction. And they did come back. What they couldn't predict was that other things would happen. For example  these fish predate on sea urchins  and when the fish were all gone  all anyone ever saw underwater was just acres and acres of sea urchins. But when the fish came back and began predating and controlling the urchin population  low and behold  kelp forests emerged in shallow water. And that's because the urchins eat kelp. So when the fish control the urchin population  the ocean was restored to its natural equilibrium. You know  this is probably how the ocean looked here one or     years ago  but nobody was around to tell us. I worked in other parts of New Zealand as well  in beautiful  fragile  protected areas like in Fiordland  where this sea pen colony was found. Little blue cod swimming in for a dash of color. In the northern part of New Zealand  I dove in the blue water  where the water's a little warmer  and photographed animals like this giant sting ray swimming through an underwater canyon. Every part of the ecosystem in this place seems very healthy  from tiny  little animals like a nudibrank crawling over encrusting sponge or a leatherjacket that is a very important animal in this ecosystem because it grazes on the bottom and allows new life to take hold. And I wanted to finish with this photograph  a picture I made on a very stormy day in New Zealand when I just laid on the bottom amidst a school of fish swirling around me. And I was in a place that had only been protected about    years ago. And I talked to divers that had been diving there for many years  and they said that the marine life was better here today than it was in the     s. And that's because it's been protected  that it has come back. So I think the message is clear. The ocean is  indeed  resilient and tolerant to a point  but we must be good custodians. I became an underwater photographer because I fell in love with the sea  and I make pictures of it today because I want to protect it  and I don't think it's too late. Thank you very much. Tom Green  That's a  chan thing. These kids on the Internet  they have this group of kids and they like to say funny words like  barrel roll.  It's a video game move from  Star Fox.   Star Fox       Assistant   Star Fox   .   Tom Green  Yeah. And they've been dogging me for a year. I got to tell you  it's driving me nuts  actually. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and I scream    chan   Christopher Poole  When I was     I found this website called Futaba Channel. And it was a Japanese forum and imageboard. That format of forum  at that time  was not well known outside of Japan. And so what I did is I took it  I translated it into English  and I stuck it up for my friends to use. Now  six and a half years later  over seven million people are using it  contributing over         posts per day. And we've gone from one board to    boards. This is what it looks like. So  what's unique about the site is that it's anonymous  and it has no memory. There's no archive  there are no barriers  there's no registration. These things that we're used to with forums don't exist on  chan. And that's led to this discussion that's completely raw  completely unfiltered. What the site's known for  because it has this environment  is it's fostered the creation of a lot of Internet phenomena  viral videos and whatnot  known as  memes.  Two of the largest memes that have come out of this site some of you might be familiar with are these LOLcats    just silly pictures of cats with text. And this resonates with millions of people  apparently  because there are tens of thousands of these  and there is a whole blogging empire now dedicated to pictures like these. And Rick Astley's kind of rebirth these past two years ... Rickroll was this bait and switch  really simple  classic bait and switch. Somebody says they're linking to something interesting  and you get an '  s pop song. That's all it was. And it got big enough to the point where there was a float last year at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade  and Rick Astley pops out  and rickrolls millions of people on television. There are thousands of memes that come out of the site. There are a handful that have escaped into the mainstream  the ones I've just shown you  but every day  every month  people are producing thousands of these. So does a site like this have rules  We do  they're the codified rules that I've come up with  which are more or less ignored by the community. And so they've come up with their own set of rules  the  Rules of the Internet.  And so there are three that I want to show you specifically. Rule one is you don't talk about  b . Two is you do not talk about  b . And this one's kind of interesting   If it exists  there is porn of it. No exceptions.  And I will spare you that slide. I assure you  it is very true.  b  is the first board we started with  and it is  in many ways  the beating heart of the website. It is where a third of all the traffic is going. And  b  is known for  more than anything  not just the memes they've created  but the exploits. And Chris just touched on one of those a second ago  and that was the Time     poll. So somebody at Time  at the magazine  thought it would be fun to nominate me for this thing they did last year. And so they placed me on it  and the Internet got wind of it. My community decided they wanted me to win it. I didn't instruct them to do it  they just decided that that's what they wanted. And so  you know      percent approval rating ain't so bad. So they broke that poll. And I ended up on top. I ended up at this really fancy party. But that's not what's interesting about this. It's that they weren't putting me at the top of this list  they were actually    it got so sophisticated to the point where they gamed all of the top    places to spell  mARBLECAKE. ALSO  THE GAME.  The amount of time and effort that went into that is absolutely incredible. And  marble cake  is significant because it is the channel that this group called Anonymous organized. Anonymous is this group of people that protested  very famously  Scientology. The story is  Scientology had this embarrassing video of Tom Cruise. It went up online. They got it taken offline and managed to piss off part of the Internet. And so these people  over       people  less than one month later  organized in a hundred cities around the globe and    this is L.A.    protested the Church of Scientology  and they have continued to do so  now  two full years after the fact. They are still protesting. So we've got this activist group that's this grassroots group that's come out of the site. And last  I'm going to show you the example  the story of Dusty the cat. Dusty is the name that we've given to this cat. This young man posted a video of him abusing his cat on YouTube. And  you know  this didn't sit well with people  and so there was this outpouring of support for people to do something about this. So what they did is they    I mean  they put CSI to shame here    the Internet detectives came out. They matched  they found his MySpace. They took the YouTube video and they mashed everything in the video. Within    hours  they had his name  and within    hours  he was arrested. And so  what I think is really intriguing about a community like  chan is just that it's this open place. As I said  it's raw  it's unfiltered. And sites like it are kind of going the way of the dinosaur right now. They're endangered because we're moving towards social networking. We're moving towards persistent identity. We're moving towards  you know  a lack of privacy  really. We're sacrificing a lot of that  and I think in doing so  moving towards those things  we're losing something valuable. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Thank you. Got a couple questions for you. But if I ask them  is the TED website going to go down  CP  You're lucky that this is not being streamed to them live right now. CA  Well  you never know. Some of them    we've got people in    countries out there watching. Don't tell. But seriously  this issue on anonymity is    I mean  you made the case there. But anonymity basically allows people to say anything  all the rules gone. You've had to wrestle with issues like child pornography. And I'm just curious whether you sometimes lie awake in the night worrying that you've opened Pandora's box. CP  Yes and no. I mean  for as much good that kind of comes out of this environment  there is plenty of bad. There are plenty of downsides. But I think that the greater good is being served here by just allowing people    there are very few places  now  where you can go and not have identity  to be completely anonymous and say whatever you'd like. And saying whatever you like  I think  is powerful. Doing whatever you like is now crossing a line. But I think it's important to have these places. When I get emails  people say   Thank you for giving me this place  this outlet  where I can come after work and be myself.  CA  But words  saying things  you know  can be constructive  it can be really damaging. And if you cut the link between what is said and any attribution back to you  I mean  surely there are huge risks with that. CP  There are  certainly. But    CA  Tell me about what    I mean  I think you asked the board what you might say at TED  right  CP  Yeah  I posted a thread on Sunday. And within    hours  it had over        responses. And the thing is  I didn't make it into that presentation because I can't read to you anything that they said  more or less.    percent of it is just  would have been  you know  bleeped out. But there were some good things that came out of that too. Love and peace were mentioned. CA  Love and peace were mentioned  kind of with quote marks around them  right  CP  Cats and dogs were mentioned too. CA  And that content is all off the board now. Right  it's gone  Or is it still up there  CP  I stuck that thread so it lasted a few days. It went up to about        posts  and now it has been taken off. CA  Okay  well. Now  I'm not sure I would have necessarily recommended everyone at TED to go and check it out anyway. Chris  you yourself  I mean  you're a figure of some intrigue. You've got this surprising semi underground influence  but it's not making you a lot of money  yet. What's the commercial picture here  CP  The commercial picture is that there really isn't much of one  I guess. The site has adult content on it. I mean  obviously  it's got some very offensive  obscene content on it  just in terms of language alone. And when you've got that  you've pretty much sacrificed any hope of making lots of money. CA  But you still live at home  right  CP  I actually moved out recently. CA  That's very cool. CP  I got out of Mom's  and I'm back in school right now. CA  But what conversations did you or do you have with your mother about  chan  CP  At first  very kind of pained  awkward conversations. The content is not dinner table conversation in the least. But my parents    I think part of why they kind of are able to appreciate it is because they don't understand it. CA  And they were probably pleased to see you on top of the Time poll. CP  Yeah. They still didn't know what to think of that though. CA  And so  in    years' time  what do you picture yourself doing  CP  That's a good question. As I said  I just went back to school  and I am considering majoring in urban studies and then going on to urban planning  kind of taking whatever I've learned from online communities and trying to adapt that to a physical community. CA  Chris  thank you. Absolutely fascinating. Thank you for coming to TED. We live in difficult and challenging economic times  of course. And one of the first victims of difficult economic times  I think  is public spending of any kind  but certainly in the firing line at the moment is public spending for science  and particularly curiosity led science and exploration. So I want to try and convince you in about    minutes that that's a ridiculous and ludicrous thing to do. But I think to set the scene  I want to show    the next slide is not my attempt to show the worst TED slide in the history of TED  but it is a bit of a mess. But actually  it's not my fault  it's from the Guardian newspaper. And it's actually a beautiful demonstration of how much science costs. Because  if I'm going to make the case for continuing to spend on curiosity driven science and exploration  I should tell you how much it costs. So this is a game called  spot the science budgets.  This is the U.K. government spend. You see there  it's about     billion a year. The science budget is actually    if you look to your left  there's a purple set of blobs and then yellow set of blobs. And it's one of the yellow set of blobs around the big yellow blob. It's about  .  billion pounds per year out of     billion. That funds everything in the U.K. from medical research  space exploration  where I work  at CERN in Geneva  particle physics  engineering  even arts and humanities  funded from the science budget  which is that  .  billion  that little  tiny yellow blob around the orange blob at the top left of the screen. So that's what we're arguing about. That percentage  by the way  is about the same in the U.S. and Germany and France. R D in total in the economy  publicly funded  is about  .  percent of GDP. So that's what we're arguing about. The first thing I want to say  and this is straight from  Wonders of the Solar System   is that our exploration of the solar system and the universe has shown us that it is indescribably beautiful. This is a picture that actually was sent back by the Cassini space probe around Saturn  after we'd finished filming  Wonders of the Solar System.  So it isn't in the series. It's of the moon Enceladus. So that big sweeping  white sphere in the corner is Saturn  which is actually in the background of the picture. And that crescent there is the moon Enceladus  which is about as big as the British Isles. It's about     kilometers in diameter. So  tiny moon. What's fascinating and beautiful ... this an unprocessed picture  by the way  I should say  it's black and white  straight from Saturnian orbit. What's beautiful is  you can probably see on the limb there some faint  sort of  wisps of almost smoke rising up from the limb. This is how we visualize that in  Wonders of the Solar System.  It's a beautiful graphic. What we found out were that those faint wisps are actually fountains of ice rising up from the surface of this tiny moon. That's fascinating and beautiful in itself  but we think that the mechanism for powering those fountains requires there to be lakes of liquid water beneath the surface of this moon. And what's important about that is that  on our planet  on Earth  wherever we find liquid water  we find life. So  to find strong evidence of liquid  pools of liquid  beneath the surface of a moon     million miles away from the Earth is really quite astounding. So what we're saying  essentially  is maybe that's a habitat for life in the solar system. Well  let me just say  that was a graphic. I just want to show this picture. That's one more picture of Enceladus. This is when Cassini flew beneath Enceladus. So it made a very low pass  just a few hundred kilometers above the surface. And so this  again  a real picture of the ice fountains rising up into space  absolutely beautiful. But that's not the prime candidate for life in the solar system. That's probably this place  which is a moon of Jupiter  Europa. And again  we had to fly to the Jovian system to get any sense that this moon  as most moons  was anything other than a dead ball of rock. It's actually an ice moon. So what you're looking at is the surface of the moon Europa  which is a thick sheet of ice  probably a hundred kilometers thick. But by measuring the way that Europa interacts with the magnetic field of Jupiter  and looking at how those cracks in the ice that you can see there on that graphic move around  we've inferred very strongly that there's an ocean of liquid surrounding the entire surface of Europa. So below the ice  there's an ocean of liquid around the whole moon. It could be hundreds of kilometers deep  we think. We think it's saltwater  and that would mean that there's more water on that moon of Jupiter than there is in all the oceans of the Earth combined. So that place  a little moon around Jupiter  is probably the prime candidate for finding life on a moon or a body outside the Earth  that we know of. Tremendous and beautiful discovery. Our exploration of the solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful. It may also have pointed the way to answering one of the most profound questions that you can possibly ask  which is   Are we alone in the universe   Is there any other use to exploration and science  other than just a sense of wonder  Well  there is. This is a very famous picture taken  actually  on my first Christmas Eve  December   th        when I was about eight months old. It was taken by Apollo   as it went around the back of the moon. Earthrise from Apollo  . A famous picture  many people have said that it's the picture that saved       which was a turbulent year    the student riots in Paris  the height of the Vietnam War. The reason many people think that about this picture  and Al Gore has said it many times  actually  on the stage at TED  is that this picture  arguably  was the beginning of the environmental movement. Because  for the first time  we saw our world  not as a solid  immovable  kind of indestructible place  but as a very small  fragile looking world just hanging against the blackness of space. What's also not often said about the space exploration  about the Apollo program  is the economic contribution it made. I mean while you can make arguments that it was wonderful and a tremendous achievement and delivered pictures like this  it cost a lot  didn't it  Well  actually  many studies have been done about the economic effectiveness  the economic impact of Apollo. The biggest one was in      by Chase Econometrics. And it showed that for every    spent on Apollo     came back into the U.S. economy. So the Apollo program paid for itself in inspiration  in engineering  achievement and  I think  in inspiring young scientists and engineers    times over. So exploration can pay for itself. What about scientific discovery  What about driving innovation  Well  this looks like a picture of virtually nothing. What it is  is a picture of the spectrum of hydrogen. See  back in the     s      s  many scientists  many observers  looked at the light given off from atoms. And they saw strange pictures like this. What you're seeing when you put it through a prism is that you heat hydrogen up and it doesn't just glow like a white light  it just emits light at particular colors  a red one  a light blue one  some dark blue ones. Now that led to an understanding of atomic structure because the way that's explained is atoms are a single nucleus with electrons going around them. And the electrons can only be in particular places. And when they jump up to the next place they can be  and fall back down again  they emit light at particular colors. And so the fact that atoms  when you heat them up  only emit light at very specific colors  was one of the key drivers that led to the development of the quantum theory  the theory of the structure of atoms. I just wanted to show this picture because this is remarkable. This is actually a picture of the spectrum of the Sun. And now  this is a picture of atoms in the Sun's atmosphere absorbing light. And again  they only absorb light at particular colors when electrons jump up and fall down  jump up and fall down. But look at the number of black lines in that spectrum. And the element helium was discovered just by staring at the light from the Sun because some of those black lines were found that corresponded to no known element. And that's why helium's called helium. It's called  helios     helios from the Sun. Now  that sounds esoteric  and indeed it was an esoteric pursuit  but the quantum theory quickly led to an understanding of the behaviors of electrons in materials like silicon  for example. The way that silicon behaves  the fact that you can build transistors  is a purely quantum phenomenon. So without that curiosity driven understanding of the structure of atoms  which led to this rather esoteric theory  quantum mechanics  then we wouldn't have transistors  we wouldn't have silicon chips  we wouldn't have pretty much the basis of our modern economy. There's one more  I think  wonderful twist to that tale. In  Wonders of the Solar System   we kept emphasizing the laws of physics are universal. It's one of the most incredible things about the physics and the understanding of nature that you get on Earth  is you can transport it  not only to the planets  but to the most distant stars and galaxies. And one of the astonishing predictions of quantum mechanics  just by looking at the structure of atoms    the same theory that describes transistors    is that there can be no stars in the universe that have reached the end of their life that are bigger than  quite specifically   .  times the mass of the Sun. That's a limit imposed on the mass of stars. You can work it out on a piece of paper in a laboratory  get a telescope  swing it to the sky  and you find that there are no dead stars bigger than  .  times the mass of the Sun. That's quite an incredible prediction. What happens when you have a star that's right on the edge of that mass  Well  this is a picture of it. This is the picture of a galaxy  a common  our garden  galaxy with  what      billion stars like our Sun in it. It's just one of billions of galaxies in the universe. There are a billion stars in the galactic core  which is why it's shining out so brightly. This is about    million light years away  so one of our neighboring galaxies. But that bright star there is actually one of the stars in the galaxy. So that star is also    million light years away. It's part of that galaxy  and it's shining as brightly as the center of the galaxy with a billion suns in it. That's a Type Ia supernova explosion. Now that's an incredible phenomena  because it's a star that sits there. It's called a carbon oxygen dwarf. It sits there about  say   .  times the mass of the Sun. And it has a binary companion that goes around it  so a big star  a big ball of gas. And what it does is it sucks gas off its companion star  until it gets to this limit called the Chandrasekhar limit  and then it explodes. And it explodes  and it shines as brightly as a billion suns for about two weeks  and releases  not only energy  but a huge amount of chemical elements into the universe. In fact  that one is a carbon oxygen dwarf. Now  there was no carbon and oxygen in the universe at the Big Bang. And there was no carbon and oxygen in the universe throughout the first generation of stars. It was made in stars like that  locked away and then returned to the universe in explosions like that in order to recondense into planets  stars  new solar systems and  indeed  people like us. I think that's a remarkable demonstration of the power and beauty and universality of the laws of physics  because we understand that process  because we understand the structure of atoms here on Earth. This is a beautiful quote that I found    we're talking about serendipity there    from Alexander Fleming   When I woke up just after dawn on September           I certainly didn't plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world's first antibiotic.  Now  the explorers of the world of the atom did not intend to invent the transistor. And they certainly didn't intend to describe the mechanics of supernova explosions  which eventually told us where the building blocks of life were synthesized in the universe. So  I think science can be    serendipity is important. It can be beautiful. It can reveal quite astonishing things. It can also  I think  finally reveal the most profound ideas to us about our place in the universe and really the value of our home planet. This is a spectacular picture of our home planet. Now  it doesn't look like our home planet. It looks like Saturn because  of course  it is. It was taken by the Cassini space probe. But it's a famous picture  not because of the beauty and majesty of Saturn's rings  but actually because of a tiny  faint blob just hanging underneath one of the rings. And if I blow it up there  you see it. It looks like a moon  but in fact  it's a picture of Earth. It was a picture of Earth captured in that frame of Saturn. That's our planet from     million miles away. I think the Earth has got a strange property that the farther away you get from it  the more beautiful it seems. But that is not the most distant or most famous picture of our planet. It was taken by this thing  which is called the Voyager spacecraft. And that's a picture of me in front of it for scale. The Voyager is a tiny machine. It's currently    billion miles away from Earth  transmitting with that dish  with the power of    watts  and we're still in contact with it. But it visited Jupiter  Saturn  Uranus and Neptune. And after it visited all four of those planets  Carl Sagan  who's one of my great heroes  had the wonderful idea of turning Voyager around and taking a picture of every planet it had visited. And it took this picture of Earth. Now it's very hard to see the Earth there  it's called the  Pale Blue Dot  picture  but Earth is suspended in that red shaft of light. That's Earth from four billion miles away. And I'd like to read you what Sagan wrote about it  just to finish  because I cannot say words as beautiful as this to describe what he saw in that picture that he had taken. He said   Consider again that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it  everyone you love  everyone you know  everyone you've ever heard of  every human being who ever was lived out their lives. The aggregates of joy and suffering thousands of confident religions  ideologies and economic doctrines  every hunter and forager  every hero and coward  every creator and destroyer of civilization  every king and peasant  every young couple in love  every mother and father  hopeful child  inventor and explorer  every teacher of morals  every corrupt politician  every superstar  every supreme leader  every saint and sinner in the history of our species  lived there  on a mote of dust  suspended in a sunbeam. It's been said that astronomy's a humbling and character building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me  it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot  the only home we've ever known.  Beautiful words about the power of science and exploration. The argument has always been made  and it will always be made  that we know enough about the universe. You could have made it in the     s  you wouldn't have had penicillin. You could have made it in the     s  you wouldn't have the transistor. And it's made today in these difficult economic times. Surely  we know enough. We don't need to discover anything else about our universe. Let me leave the last words to someone who's rapidly becoming a hero of mine  Humphrey Davy  who did his science at the turn of the   th century. He was clearly under assault all the time.  We know enough at the turn of the   th century. Just exploit it  just build things.  He said this  he said   Nothing is more fatal to the progress of the human mind than to presume that our views of science are ultimate  that our triumphs are complete  that there are no mysteries in nature  and that there are no new worlds to conquer.  Thank you. Hi there. I'm going to be talking a little bit about music  machines and life. Or  more specifically  what we learned from the creation of a very large and complicated machine for a music video. Some of you may recognize this image. This is the opening frame of the video that we created. We'll be showing the video at the end  but before we do  I want to talk a little bit about what it is that they wanted. Now  when we first started talking to OK Go    the name of the song is  This Too Shall Pass     we were really excited because they expressed interest in building a machine that they could dance with. And we were very excited about this because  of course  they have a history of dancing with machines. They're responsible for this video   Here It Goes Again.     million plus views on YouTube. Four guys dancing on treadmills  no cuts  just a static camera. A fantastically viral and wonderful video. So we were really excited about working with them. And we sort of started talking about what it is that they wanted. And they explained that they wanted kind of a Rube Goldberg machine. Now  for those of you who don't know  a Rube Goldberg machine is a complicated contraption  an incredibly over engineered piece of machinery that accomplishes a relatively simple task. So we were excited by this idea  and we started talking about exactly what it would look like. And we came up with some parameters  because  you know  building a Rube Goldberg machine has limitations  but it also is pretty wide open. And we wanted to make sure that we did something that would work for a music video. So we came up with a list of requirements  the     commandments   and they were  in order of ascending difficulty  The first is  No magic.  Everything that happened on screen had to be very easily understood by a typical viewer. The rule of thumb was that  if my mother couldn't understand it  then we couldn't use it in the video. They wanted band integration  that is  the machine acting upon the band members  specifically not the other way around. They wanted the machine action to follow the song feeling. So as the song picks up emotion  so should the machine get grander in its process. They wanted us to make use of the space. So we have this        square foot warehouse we were using  divided between two floors. It included an exterior loading dock. We used all of that  including a giant hole in the floor that we actually descended the camera and cameraman through. They wanted it messy  and we were happy to oblige. The machine itself would start the music. So the machine would get started  it would travel some distance  reacting along the way  hit play on an iPod or a tape deck or something that would start playback. And the machine would maintain synchronization throughout. And speaking of synchronization  they wanted it to sync to the rhythm and to hit specific beats along the way. Okay.  Laughter  They wanted it to end precisely on time. Okay  so now the start to finish timing has to be perfect. And they wanted the music to drop out at a certain point in the video and actual live audio from the machine to play part of the song. And as if that wasn't enough  all of these incredibly complicating things  right  they wanted it in one shot. Okay. So  just some statistics about what we went through in the process. The machine itself has    distinct interactions. It took us    takes to get it on film to our satisfaction. Of those    takes  only three actually successfully completed their run. We destroyed two pianos and    televisions in the process. We went to Home Depot well over a hundred times. And we lost one high heeled shoe when one of our engineers  Heather Knight  left her high heeled shoe    after a nice dinner  and returned back to the build    and left it in a pile of stuff. And another engineer thought   Well  that would be a really good thing to use  and ended up using it as a really nice trigger. And it's actually in the machine. So what did we learn from all of this  Well  having completed this  we have the opportunity to step back and reflect on some of the things. And we learned that small stuff stinks. Little balls in wooden tracks are really susceptible to humidity and temperature and a little bit of dust  and they fall out of the tracks  the exact angles makes it hard to get right. And yet  a bowling ball will always follow the same path. It doesn't matter what temperature it is  doesn't matter what's in its way  it will pretty much get where it needs to go. But as much as the small stuff stinks  we needed somewhere to start  so that we would have somewhere to go. And so you have to start with it. You have to focus on it. Small stuff stinks  but  of course  it's essential  right  What else  Planning is incredibly important. You know  we spent a lot of time ideating and even building some of these things. It's been said that   No battle plan survives contact with the enemy.  I think our enemy was physics    and she's a cruel mistress. Often  we had to pull things out as a result because of timing or aesthetics or whatever. And so while planning is important  so is flexibility. These are all things that ended up not making it into the final machine. So also  put reliable stuff last  the stuff that's going to run every time. Again  small to large is relevant here. The little Lego car in the beginning of the video references the big  real car near the end of the video. The big  real car works every time  there's no problem about it. The little one had a tendency to try to run off the track and that's a problem. But you don't want to have to reset the whole machine because the Lego car at the end doesn't work  right. So you put that up front so that  if it fails  at least you know you don't have to reset the whole thing. Life can be messy. There were incredibly difficult moments in the building of this thing. Months were spent in this tiny  cold warehouse. And the wonderful elation that we had when we finally completed it. So it's important to remember that whether it's good or it's bad   This Too Shall Pass.  Thank you very much. And now to introduce their music video  we have OK Go. OK Go  An introduction. Hello TEDxUSC. We are OK Go. What are we doing  Oh  just hanging out with our Grammy. What what  It think we can do better than this. Hello TEDxUSC. We are OK Go. Have you read the  Natural Curiosity Cabinet   I mean   Curiosity     excuse me. Let me start again. We need some more ridiculous things besides  The Cabinet of Natural Curiosities.  Tim's sundial hat. Have you seen the new work they've done to the Waltz Towers  Sorry  start again. Dogs. Hello  TEDxUSC. We are OK Go  and this our new video   This Too Shall Pass.   unclear  Kay  we can still do one better I think  yeah. That one's pretty good. It's getting better.   You know you can't keep letting it get you down     And you can't keep dragging that dead weight around     If there ain't all that much to lug around     Better run like hell when you hit the ground     When the morning comes     When the morning comes     You can't stop these kids from dancing     Why would you want to      Especially when you're already getting yours     Cuz if your mind don't move and your knees don't bend     Well don't go blaming the kids again     When the morning comes     When the morning comes     When the morning comes     When the morning comes     When the morning comes     When the morning comes     Let it go     This too shall pass     Let it go     This too shall pass     You know you can't keep letting it get you down     No  you can't keep letting it get you down     Let it go     This too shall pass     When the morning comes     When the morning comes     When the morning comes     When the morning comes   One thing the world needs  one thing this country desperately needs is a better way of conducting our political debates. We need to rediscover the lost art of democratic argument. If you think about the arguments we have  most of the time it's shouting matches on cable television  ideological food fights on the floor of Congress. I have a suggestion. Look at all the arguments we have these days over health care  over bonuses and bailouts on Wall Street  over the gap between rich and poor  over affirmative action and same sex marriage. Lying just beneath the surface of those arguments  with passions raging on all sides  are big questions of moral philosophy  big questions of justice. But we too rarely articulate and defend and argue about those big moral questions in our politics. So what I would like to do today is have something of a discussion. First  let me take a famous philosopher who wrote about those questions of justice and morality  give you a very short lecture on Aristotle of ancient Athens  Aristotle's theory of justice  and then have a discussion here to see whether Aristotle's ideas actually inform the way we think and argue about questions today. So  are you ready for the lecture  According to Aristotle  justice means giving people what they deserve. That's it  that's the lecture. Now  you may say  well  that's obvious enough. The real questions begin when it comes to arguing about who deserves what and why. Take the example of flutes. Suppose we're distributing flutes. Who should get the best ones  Let's see what people    What would you say  Who should get the best flute  You can just call it out. Michael Sandel  At random. You would do it by lottery. Or by the first person to rush into the hall to get them. Who else  MS  The best flute players.  Audience  The worst flute players.  MS  The worst flute players. How many say the best flute players  Why  Actually  that was Aristotle's answer too. But here's a harder question. Why do you think  those of you who voted this way  that the best flutes should go to the best flute players  Peter  The greatest benefit to all. MS  The greatest benefit to all. We'll hear better music if the best flutes should go to the best flute players. That's Peter   Audience  Peter.  MS  All right. Well  it's a good reason. We'll all be better off if good music is played rather than terrible music. But Peter  Aristotle doesn't agree with you that that's the reason. That's all right. Aristotle had a different reason for saying the best flutes should go to the best flute players. He said  that's what flutes are for    to be played well. He says that to reason about just distribution of a thing  we have to reason about  and sometimes argue about  the purpose of the thing  or the social activity    in this case  musical performance. And the point  the essential nature  of musical performance is to produce excellent music. It'll be a happy byproduct that we'll all benefit. But when we think about justice  Aristotle says  what we really need to think about is the essential nature of the activity in question and the qualities that are worth honoring and admiring and recognizing. One of the reasons that the best flute players should get the best flutes is that musical performance is not only to make the rest of us happy  but to honor and recognize the excellence of the best musicians. Now  flutes may seem ... the distribution of flutes may seem a trivial case. Let's take a contemporary example of the dispute about justice. It had to do with golf. Casey Martin    a few years ago  Casey Martin    did any of you hear about him  He was a very good golfer  but he had a disability. He had a bad leg  a circulatory problem  that made it very painful for him to walk the course. In fact  it carried risk of injury. He asked the PGA  the Professional Golfers' Association  for permission to use a golf cart in the PGA tournaments. They said   No. Now that would give you an unfair advantage.  He sued  and his case went all the way to the Supreme Court  believe it or not  the case over the golf cart  because the law says that the disabled must be accommodated  provided the accommodation does not change the essential nature of the activity. He says   I'm a great golfer. I want to compete. But I need a golf cart to get from one hole to the next.  Suppose you were on the Supreme Court. Suppose you were deciding the justice of this case. How many here would say that Casey Martin does have a right to use a golf cart  And how many say  no  he doesn't  All right  let's take a poll  show of hands. How many would rule in favor of Casey Martin  And how many would not  How many would say he doesn't  All right  we have a good division of opinion here. Someone who would not grant Casey Martin the right to a golf cart  what would be your reason  Raise your hand  and we'll try to get you a microphone. What would be your reason  MS  It would be an unfair advantage if he gets to ride in a golf cart. All right  those of you  I imagine most of you who would not give him the golf cart worry about an unfair advantage. What about those of you who say he should be given a golf cart  How would you answer the objection  Yes  all right. Audience  The cart's not part of the game. MS  What's your name   Audience  Charlie.  MS  Charlie says    We'll get Charlie a microphone in case someone wants to reply. Tell us  Charlie  why would you say he should be able to use a golf cart  Charlie  The cart's not part of the game. MS  But what about walking from hole to hole  Charlie  It doesn't matter  it's not part of the game. MS  Walking the course is not part of the game of golf  Charlie  Not in my book  it isn't. MS  All right. Stay there  Charlie. Who has an answer for Charlie  All right  who has an answer for Charlie  What would you say  Audience  The endurance element is a very important part of the game  walking all those holes. MS  Walking all those holes  That's part of the game of golf   Audience  Absolutely.  MS  What's your name   Audience  Warren.  MS  Warren. Charlie  what do you say to Warren  Charley  I'll stick to my original thesis. MS  Warren  are you a golfer  Warren  I am not a golfer. Charley  And I am.  MS  Okay.  You know  it's interesting. In the case  in the lower court  they brought in golfing greats to testify on this very issue. Is walking the course essential to the game  And they brought in Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer. And what do you suppose they all said  Yes. They agreed with Warren. They said  yes  walking the course is strenuous physical exercise. The fatigue factor is an important part of golf. And so it would change the fundamental nature of the game to give him the golf cart. Now  notice  something interesting    Well  I should tell you about the Supreme Court first. The Supreme Court decided. What do you suppose they said  They said yes  that Casey Martin must be provided a golf cart. Seven to two  they ruled. What was interesting about their ruling and about the discussion we've just had is that the discussion about the right  the justice  of the matter depended on figuring out what is the essential nature of golf. And the Supreme Court justices wrestled with that question. And Justice Stevens  writing for the majority  said he had read all about the history of golf  and the essential point of the game is to get very small ball from one place into a hole in as few strokes as possible  and that walking was not essential  but incidental. Now  there were two dissenters  one of whom was Justice Scalia. He wouldn't have granted the cart  and he had a very interesting dissent. It's interesting because he rejected the Aristotelian premise underlying the majority's opinion. He said it's not possible to determine the essential nature of a game like golf. Here's how he put it.  To say that something is essential is ordinarily to say that it is necessary to the achievement of a certain object. But since it is the very nature of a game to have no object except amusement  that is  what distinguishes games from productive activity  it is quite impossible to say that any of a game's arbitrary rules is essential.  So there you have Justice Scalia taking on the Aristotelian premise of the majority's opinion. Justice Scalia's opinion is questionable for two reasons. First  no real sports fan would talk that way. If we had thought that the rules of the sports we care about are merely arbitrary  rather than designed to call forth the virtues and the excellences that we think are worthy of admiring  we wouldn't care about the outcome of the game. It's also objectionable on a second ground. On the face of it  it seemed to be    this debate about the golf cart    an argument about fairness  what's an unfair advantage. But if fairness were the only thing at stake  there would have been an easy and obvious solution. What would it be   Audience  Let everyone use the cart.  Let everyone ride in a golf cart if they want to. Then the fairness objection goes away. But letting everyone ride in a cart would have been  I suspect  more anathema to the golfing greats and to the PGA  even than making an exception for Casey Martin. Why  Because what was at stake in the dispute over the golf cart was not only the essential nature of golf  but  relatedly  the question  What abilities are worthy of honor and recognition as athletic talents  Let me put the point as delicately as possible  Golfers are a little sensitive about the athletic status of their game. After all  there's no running or jumping  and the ball stands still. So if golfing is the kind of game that can be played while riding around in a golf cart  it would be hard to confer on the golfing greats the status that we confer  the honor and recognition that goes to truly great athletes. That illustrates that with golf  as with flutes  it's hard to decide the question of what justice requires  without grappling with the question   What is the essential nature of the activity in question  and what qualities  what excellences connected with that activity  are worthy of honor and recognition   Let's take a final example that's prominent in contemporary political debate  same sex marriage. There are those who favor state recognition only of traditional marriage between one man and one woman  and there are those who favor state recognition of same sex marriage. How many here favor the first policy  the state should recognize traditional marriage only  And how many favor the second  same sex marriage  Now  put it this way  What ways of thinking about justice and morality underlie the arguments we have over marriage  The opponents of same sex marriage say that the purpose of marriage  fundamentally  is procreation  and that's what's worthy of honoring and recognizing and encouraging. And the defenders of same sex marriage say no  procreation is not the only purpose of marriage  what about a lifelong  mutual  loving commitment  That's really what marriage is about. So with flutes  with golf carts  and even with a fiercely contested question like same sex marriage  Aristotle has a point. Very hard to argue about justice without first arguing about the purpose of social institutions and about what qualities are worthy of honor and recognition. So let's step back from these cases and see how they shed light on the way we might improve  elevate  the terms of political discourse in the United States  and for that matter  around the world. There is a tendency to think that if we engage too directly with moral questions in politics  that's a recipe for disagreement  and for that matter  a recipe for intolerance and coercion. So better to shy away from  to ignore  the moral and the religious convictions that people bring to civic life. It seems to me that our discussion reflects the opposite  that a better way to mutual respect is to engage directly with the moral convictions citizens bring to public life  rather than to require that people leave their deepest moral convictions outside politics before they enter. That  it seems to me  is a way to begin to restore the art of democratic argument. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks. Thank you. Chris. Thanks  Chris. Chris Anderson  From flutes to golf courses to same sex marriage    that was a genius link. Now look  you're a pioneer of open education. Your lecture series was one of the first to do it big. What's your vision for the next phase of this  MS  Well  I think that it is possible. In the classroom  we have arguments on some of the most fiercely held moral convictions that students have about big public questions. And I think we can do that in public life more generally. And so my real dream would be to take the public television series that we've created of the course    it's available now  online  free for everyone anywhere in the world    and to see whether we can partner with institutions  at universities in China  in India  in Africa  around the world  to try to promote civic education and also a richer kind of democratic debate. CA  So you picture  at some point  live  in real time  you could have this kind of conversation  inviting questions  but with people from China and India joining in  MS  Right. We did a little bit of it here with       people in Long Beach  and we do it in a classroom at Harvard with about       students. Wouldn't it be interesting to take this way of thinking and arguing  engaging seriously with big moral questions  exploring cultural differences and connect through a live video hookup  students in Beijing and Mumbai and in Cambridge  Massachusetts and create a global classroom. That's what I would love to do. CA  So  I would imagine that there are a lot of people who would love to join you in that endeavor. Michael Sandel. Thank you so much.  MS  Thanks so much.  In Africa we say   God gave the white man a watch and gave the black man time.  I think  how is it possible for a man with so much time to tell his story in    minutes  I think it will be quite a challenge for me. Most African stories these days  they talk about famine  HIV and AIDS  poverty or war. But my story that I would like to share with you today is the one about success. It is about a country in the southwest of Africa called Namibia. Namibia has got  .  million people  but it is only twice the size of California. I come from a region in the remote northwest part of the country. It's called Kunene region. And in the center of Kunene region is the village of Sesfontein. This is where I was born. This is where I'm coming from. Most people that are following the story of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt will know where Namibia is. They love Namibia for its beautiful dunes  that are even taller than the Empire State Building. Wind and time have twisted our landscape into very strange shapes  and these shapes are speckled with wildlife that has become so adapted to this harsh and strange land. I'm a Himba. You might wonder  why are you wearing these Western clothes  I'm a Himba and Namibian. A Himba is one of the    ethnic groups in Namibia. We live a very traditional lifestyle. I grew up herding  looking after our livestock    goats  sheep and cattle. And one day  my father actually took me into the bush. He said   John  I want you to become a good herder. Boy  if you are looking after our livestock and you see a cheetah eating our goat    cheetah is very nervous    just walk up to it. Walk up to it and smack it on the backside.   And he will let go of the goat and run off.  But then he said   Boy  if you run into a lion  don't move. Don't move. Stand your ground. Puff up and just look it in the eye and it may not want to fight you.  But then  he said   If you see a leopard  boy  you better run like hell.   Imagine you run faster than those goats you are looking after.  In this way    In this way  I actually started to learn about nature. In addition to being an ordinary Namibian and in addition to being a Himba I'm also a trained conservationist. And it is very important if you are in the field to know what to confront and what to run from. I was born in     . We lived under apartheid regime. The whites could farm  graze and hunt as they wished  but we black  we were not regarded as responsible to use wildlife. Whenever we tried to hunt  we were called poachers. And as a result  we were fined and locked up in jail. Between      and       the U.S. and Soviet interests fought for control over my country. And you know  during war time  there are militaries  armies  that are moving around. And the army hunted for valuable rhino horns and tusks. They could sell these things for anything between        a kilo. During the same year almost every Himba had a rifle. Because it was wartime  the British .    rifle was just all over the whole country. Then in the same time  around       we had a very big drought. It killed almost everything that was left. Our livestock was almost at the brink of extinction  protected as well. We were hungry. I remember a night when a hungry leopard went into the house of one of our neighbors and took a sleeping child out of the bed. It's a very sad story. But even today  that memory is still in people's minds. They can pinpoint the exact location where this all happened. And then  in the same year  we almost lost everything. And my father said   Why don't you just go to school   And they sent me off to school  just to get busy somewhere there. And the year I went to school  my father actually got a job with a non governmental organization called IRDNC  Integrated Rural Development and Nature Conservation. They actually spend a lot of time a year in the communities. They were trusted by the local communities like our leader  Joshua Kangombe. Joshua Kangombe saw what was happening  wildlife disappearing  poaching was skyrocketing  and the situation seemed very hopeless. Death and despair surrounded Joshua and our entire communities. But then  the people from IRDNC proposed to Joshua  What if we pay people that you trust to look after wildlife  Do you have anybody in your communities  or people  that know the bush very well and that know wildlife very well  The headman said   Yes. Our poachers.   Eh  The poachers    Yes. Our poachers.  And that was my father. My father has been a poacher for quite a long time. Instead of shooting poachers dead like they were doing elsewhere in Africa  IRDNC has helped men reclaim their abilities to manage their peoples and their rights to own and manage wildlife. And thus  as people started feeling ownership over wildlife  wildlife numbers started coming back  and that's actually becoming a foundation for conservation in Namibia. With independence  the whole approach of community getting involved was embraced by our new government. Three things that actually help to build on this foundation  The very first one is honoring of tradition and being open to new ideas. Here is our tradition  At every Himba village  there is a sacred fire. And at this sacred fire  the spirit of our ancestors speak through the headman and advise us where to get water  where to get grazings  and where to go and hunt. And I think this is the best way of regulating ourselves on the environment. And here are the new ideas. Transporting rhinos using helicopters I think is much easier than talking through a spirit that you can't see  isn't it  And these things we were taught by outsiders. We learned these things from outsiders. We needed new boundaries to describe our traditional lands  we needed to learn more things like GPS just to see whether    can GPS really reflect the true reflection of the land or is this just a thing made somewhere in the West  And we then wanted to see whether we can match our ancestral maps with digital maps made somewhere in the world. And through this  we actually started realizing our dreams  and we maintained honoring our traditions but we were still open to new ideas. The second element is that we wanted to have a life  a better life where we can benefit through many things. Most poachers  like my father  were people from our own community. They were not people from outside. These were our own people. And sometimes  once they were caught  they were treated with respect  brought back into the communities and they were made part of the bigger dreams. The best one  like my father    I'm not campaigning for my father    they were put in charge to stop others from poaching. And when this thing started going on  we started becoming one community  renewing our connection to nature. And that was a very strong thing in Namibia. The last element that actually helped develop these things was the partnerships. Our government has given legal status over our traditional lands. The other partners that we have got is business communities. Business communities helped bring Namibia onto the world map and they have also helped make wildlife a very valuable land use like any other land uses such as agriculture. And most of my conservation colleagues today that you find in Namibia have been trained through the initiative  through the involvement of World Wildlife Fund in the most up to date conservation practices. They have also given funding for two decades to this whole program. And so far  with the support of World Wildlife Fund  we've been able to scale up the very small programs to national programs today. Namibia ... or Sesfontein was no more an isolated village somewhere  hidden away in Namibia. With these assets we are now part of the global village. Thirty years have passed since my father's first job as a community game guard. It's very unfortunate that he passed away and he cannot see the success as I and my children see it today. When I finished school in       there were only    lions in the entire Northwest    in our area. But today  there are more than     lions. So please  if you go to Namibia  make sure that you stay in the tents. Don't walk out at night  The black rhino    they were almost extinct in     . But today  Kunene has the largest concentration of black rhino    free roaming black rhinos    in the world. This is outside the protected area. The leopard    they are now in big numbers but they are now far away from our village  because the natural plain has multiplied  like zebras  springboks and everything. They stay very much far away because this other thing has multiplied from less than a thousand to tens of thousands of animals. What started as very small  community rangers getting community involved  has now grown into something that we call conservancies. Conservancies are legally instituted institutions by the government  and these are run by the communities themselves  for their benefit. Today  we have got    conservancies that manage and protect over    million hectares of land in Namibia. We have already reshaped conservation in the entire country. Nowhere else in the world has community adopted conservation at this scale. In       conservancy generated  .  million dollars. This is our new economy    an economy based on the respect of our natural resources. And we are able to use this money for many things  Very importantly  we put it in education. Secondly  we put it for infrastructure. Food. Very important as well    we invest this money in AIDS and HIV education. You know that Africa is being affected by these viruses. And this is the good news from Africa that we have to shout from the rooftops. And now  what the world really needs is for you to help me and our partners take some of what we have learned in Namibia to other places with similar problems  places like Mongolia  or even in your own backyards  the Northern Great Plains  where buffalo and other animals have suffered and many communities are in decline. I like that one  Namibia serving as a model to Africa  and Africa serving as a model to the United States. We were successful in Namibia because we dreamed of a future that was much more than just a healthy wildlife. We knew conservation would fail if it doesn't work to improve the lives of the local communities. So  come and talk to me about Namibia  and better yet  come to Namibia and see for yourself how we have done it. And please  do visit our website to learn more and see how you can help CBNRM in Africa and across the world. Thank you very much. Those of you who may remember me from TEDGlobal remember me asking a few questions which still preoccupy me. One of them was  Why is it necessary to spend six billion pounds speeding up the Eurostar train when  for about    percent of that money  you could have top supermodels  male and female  serving free Chateau Petrus to all the passengers for the entire duration of the journey  You'd still have five billion left in change  and people would ask for the trains to be slowed down. Now  you may remember me asking the question as well  a very interesting observation  that actually those strange little signs that actually flash      at you  occasionally accompanying a little smiley face or a frown  according to whether you're within or outside the speed limit    those are actually more effective at preventing road accidents than speed cameras  which come with the actual threat of real punishment. So there seems to be a strange disproportionality at work  I think  in many areas of human problem solving  particularly those which involve human psychology  which is  The tendency of the organization or the institution is to deploy as much force as possible  as much compulsion as possible  whereas actually  the tendency of the person is to be almost influenced in absolute reverse proportion to the amount of force being applied. So there seems to be a complete disconnect here. So what I'm asking for is the creation of a new job title    I'll come to this a little later    and perhaps the addition of a new word into the English language. Because it does seem to me that large organizations including government  which is  of course  the largest organization of all  have actually become completely disconnected with what actually matters to people. Let me give you one example of this. You may remember this as the AOL Time Warner merger  okay  heralded at the time as the largest single deal of all time. It may still be  for all I know. Now  all of you in this room  in one form or other  are probably customers of one or both of those organizations that merged. Just interested  did anybody notice anything different as a result of this at all  So unless you happened to be a shareholder of one or the other organizations or one of the dealmakers or lawyers involved in the no doubt lucrative activity  you're actually engaging in a huge piece of activity that meant absolutely bugger all to anybody  okay  By contrast  years of marketing have taught me that if you actually want people to remember you and to appreciate what you do  the most potent things are actually very  very small. This is from Virgin Atlantic upper class  it's the cruet salt and pepper set. Quite nice in itself  they're little  sort of  airplane things. What's really  really sweet is every single person looking at these things has exactly the same mischievous thought  which is   I reckon I can heist these.  However  you pick them up and underneath  actually engraved in the metal  are the words   Stolen from Virgin Atlantic Airways upper class.  Now  years after you remember the strategic question of whether you're flying in a     or an Airbus  you remember those words and that experience. Similarly  this is from a hotel in Stockholm  the Lydmar. Has anybody stayed there  It's the lift  it's a series of buttons in the lift. Nothing unusual about that at all  except that these are actually not the buttons that take you to an individual floor. It starts with garage at the bottom  I suppose  appropriately  but it doesn't go up garage  grand floor  mezzanine  one  two  three  four. It actually says garage  funk  rhythm and blues. You have a series of buttons. You actually choose your lift music. My guess is that the cost of installing this in the lift in the Lydmar Hotel in Stockholm is probably     to       pounds max. It's frankly more memorable than all those millions of hotels we've all stayed at that tell you that your room has actually been recently renovated at a cost of         dollars  in order to make it resemble every other hotel room you've ever stayed in in the entire course of your life. Now  these are trivial marketing examples  I accept. But I was at a TED event recently and Esther Duflo  probably one of the leading experts in  effectively  the eradication of poverty in the developing world  actually spoke. And she came across a similar example of something that fascinated me as being something which  in a business context or a government context  would simply be so trivial a solution as to seem embarrassing. It was simply to encourage the inoculation of children by  not only making it a social event    I think good use of behavioral economics in that  if you turn up with several other mothers to have your child inoculated  your sense of confidence is much greater than if you turn up alone. But secondly  to incentivize that inoculation by giving a kilo of lentils to everybody who participated. It's a tiny  tiny thing. If you're a senior person at UNESCO and someone says   So what are you doing to eradicate world poverty   you're not really confident standing up there saying   I've got it cracked  it's the lentils   are you  Our own sense of self aggrandizement feels that big important problems need to have big important  and most of all  expensive solutions attached to them. And yet  what behavioral economics shows time after time after time is in human behavioral and behavioral change there's a very  very strong disproportionality at work  that actually what changes our behavior and what changes our attitude to things is not actually proportionate to the degree of expense entailed  or the degree of force that's applied. But everything about institutions makes them uncomfortable with that disproportionality. So what happens in an institution is the very person who has the power to solve the problem also has a very  very large budget. And once you have a very  very large budget  you actually look for expensive things to spend it on. What is completely lacking is a class of people who have immense amounts of power  but no money at all. It's those people I'd quite like to create in the world going forward. Now  here's another thing that happens  which is what I call sometimes  Terminal   syndrome   which is that big  expensive things get big  highly intelligent attention  and they're great  and Terminal   is absolutely magnificent  until you get down to the small detail  the usability  which is the signage  which is catastrophic. You come out of  Arrive  at the airport  and you follow a big yellow sign that says  Trains  and it's in front of you. So you walk for another hundred yards  expecting perhaps another sign  that might courteously be yellow  in front of you and saying  Trains.  No  no  no  the next one is actually blue  to your left  and says  Heathrow Express.  I mean  it could almost be rather like that scene from the film  Airplane.  A yellow sign  That's exactly what they'll be expecting. Actually  what happens in the world increasingly    now  all credit to the British Airport Authority. I spoke about this before  and a brilliant person got in touch with me and said   Okay  what can you do   So I did come up with five suggestions  which they are actually actioning. One of them also being  although logically it's quite a good idea to have a lift with no up and down button in it  if it only serves two floors  it's actually bloody terrifying  okay  Because when the door closes and there's nothing for you to do  you've actually just stepped into a Hammer film. So these questions ... what is happening in the world is the big stuff  actually  is done magnificently well. But the small stuff  what you might call the user interface  is done spectacularly badly. But also  there seems to be a complete sort of gridlock in terms of solving these small solutions. Because the people who can actually solve them actually are too powerful and too preoccupied with something they think of as  strategy  to actually solve them. I tried this exercise recently  talking about banking. They said   Can we do an advertising campaign  What can we do and encourage more online banking   I said   It's really  really easy.  I said   When people login to their online bank there are lots and lots of things they'd probably quite like to look at. The last thing in the world you ever want to see is your balance.  I've got friends who actually never use their own bank cash machines because there's the risk that it might display their balance on the screen. Why would you willingly expose yourself to bad news  Okay  you simply wouldn't. I said   If you make  actually  'Tell me my balance.' If you make that an option rather than the default  you'll find twice as many people log on to online banking  and they do it three times as often.  Let's face it  most of us    how many of you actually check your balance before you remove cash from a cash machine  And you're pretty rich by the standards of the world at large. Now  interesting that no single person does that  or at least can admit to being so anal as to do it. But what's interesting about that suggestion was that  to implement that suggestion wouldn't cost    million pounds  it wouldn't involve large amounts of expenditure  it would actually cost about    quid. And yet  it never happens. Because there's a fundamental disconnect  as I said  that actually  the people with the power want to do big expensive things. And there's to some extent a big strategy myth that's prevalent in business now. And if you think about it  it's very  very important that the strategy myth is maintained. Because  if the board of directors convince everybody that the success of any organization is almost entirely dependent on the decisions made by the board of directors  it makes the disparity in salaries slightly more justifiable than if you actually acknowledge that quite a lot of the credit for a company's success might actually lie somewhere else  in small pieces of tactical activity. But what is happening is that effectively    and the invention of the spreadsheet hasn't helped this  lots of things haven't helped this    business and government suffers from a kind of physics envy. It wants the world to be the kind of place where the input and the change are proportionate. It's a kind of mechanistic world that we'd all love to live in where  effectively  it sits very nicely on spreadsheets  everything is numerically expressible  and the amount you spend on something is proportionate to the scale of your success. That's the world people actually want. In truth  we do live in a world that science can understand. Unfortunately  the science is probably closer to being climatology in that in many cases  very  very small changes can have disproportionately huge effects  and equally  vast areas of activity  enormous mergers  can actually accomplish absolutely bugger all. But it's very  very uncomfortable for us to actually acknowledge that we're living in such a world. But what I'm saying is we could just make things a little bit better for ourselves if we looked at it in this very simple four way approach. That is actually strategy  and I'm not denying that strategy has a role. You know  there are cases where you spend quite a lot of money and you accomplish quite a lot. And I'd be wrong to dis that completely. Moving over  we come  of course  to consultancy. I thought it was very indecent of Accenture to ditch Tiger Woods in such a sort of hurried and hasty way. I mean  Tiger surely was actually obeying the Accenture model. He developed an interesting outsourcing model for sexual services  no longer tied to a single monopoly provider  in many cases  sourcing things locally  and of course  the ability to have between one and three girls delivered at any time led for better load balancing. So what Accenture suddenly found so unattractive about that  I'm not sure. Then there are other things that don't cost much and achieve absolutely nothing. That's called trivia. But there's a fourth thing. And the fundamental problem is we don't actually have a word for this stuff. We don't know what to call it. And actually we don't spend nearly enough money looking for those things  looking for those tiny things that may or may not work  but which  if they do work  can have a success absolutely out of proportion to their expense  their efforts and the disruption they cause. So the first thing I'd like is a competition    to anybody watching this as a film    is to come up with a name for that stuff on the bottom right. And the second thing  I think  is that the world needs to have people in charge of that. That's why I call for the  Chief Detail Officer.  Every corporation should have one  and every government should have a Ministry of Detail. The people who actually have no money  who have no extravagant budget  but who realize that actually you might achieve greater success in uptake of a government program by actually doubling the level of benefits you pay  but you'll probably achieve exactly that same effect simply by redesigning the form and writing it in comprehensible English. And if actually we created a Ministry of Detail and business actually had Chief Detail Officers  then that fourth quadrant  which is so woefully neglected at the moment  might finally get the attention it deserves. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  We're having a debate. The debate is over the proposition   What the world needs now is nuclear energy.  True or false  And before we have the debate  I'd like to actually take a show of hands    on balance  right now  are you for or against this  So those who are  yes   raise your hand.  For.  Okay  hands down. Those who are against  raise your hands. Okay  I'm reading that at about    to    in favor at the start. Which means we're going to take a vote at the end and see how that shifts  if at all. So here's the format  They're going to have six minutes each  and then after one little  quick exchange between them  I want two people on each side of this debate in the audience to have    seconds to make one short  crisp  pungent  powerful point. So  in favor of the proposition  possibly shockingly  is one of  truly  the founders of the environmental movement  a long standing TEDster  the founder of the Whole Earth Catalog  someone we all know and love  Stewart Brand. Stewart Brand  Whoa. The saying is that with climate  those who know the most are the most worried. With nuclear  those who know the most are the least worried. A classic example is James Hansen  a NASA climatologist pushing for     parts per million carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. He came out with a wonderful book recently called  Storms of My Grandchildren.  And Hansen is hard over for nuclear power  as are most climatologists who are engaging this issue seriously. This is the design situation  a planet that is facing climate change and is now half urban. Look at the client base for this. Five out of six of us live in the developing world. We are moving to cities. We are moving up in the world. And we are educating our kids  having fewer kids  basically good news all around. But we move to cities  toward the bright lights  and one of the things that is there that we want  besides jobs  is electricity. And if it isn't easily gotten  we'll go ahead and steal it. This is one of the most desired things by poor people all over the world  in the cities and in the countryside. Electricity for cities  at its best  is what's called baseload electricity. That's where it is on all the time. And so far there are only three major sources of that    coal and gas  hydro electric  which in most places is maxed out    and nuclear. I would love to have something in the fourth place here  but in terms of constant  clean  scalable energy   solar  and wind and the other renewables aren't there yet because they're inconstant. Nuclear is and has been for    years. Now  from an environmental standpoint  the main thing you want to look at is what happens to the waste from nuclear and from coal  the two major sources of electricity. If all of your electricity in your lifetime came from nuclear  the waste from that lifetime of electricity would go in a Coke can    a pretty heavy Coke can  about two pounds. But one day of coal adds up to one hell of a lot of carbon dioxide in a normal one gigawatt coal fired plant. Then what happens to the waste  The nuclear waste typically goes into a dry cask storage out back of the parking lot at the reactor site because most places don't have underground storage yet. It's just as well  because it can stay where it is. While the carbon dioxide  vast quantities of it  gigatons  goes into the atmosphere where we can't get it back    yet    and where it is causing the problems that we're most concerned about. So when you add up the greenhouse gases in the lifetime of these various energy sources  nuclear is down there with wind and hydro  below solar and way below  obviously  all the fossil fuels. Wind is wonderful  I love wind. I love being around these big wind generators. But one of the things we're discovering is that wind  like solar  is an actually relatively dilute source of energy. And so it takes a very large footprint on the land  a very large footprint in terms of materials  five to    times what you'd use for nuclear  and typically to get one gigawatt of electricity is on the order of     square miles of wind farm. In places like Denmark and Germany  they've maxed out on wind already. They've run out of good sites. The power lines are getting overloaded. And you peak out. Likewise  with solar  especially here in California  we're discovering that the    solar farm schemes that are going forward want to basically bulldoze       square miles of southern California desert. Well  as an environmentalist  we would rather that didn't happen. It's okay on frapped out agricultural land. Solar's wonderful on rooftops. But out in the landscape  one gigawatt is on the order of    square miles of bulldozed desert. When you add all these things up    Saul Griffith did the numbers and figured out what would it take to get    clean terawatts of energy from wind  solar and biofuels  and that area would be roughly the size of the United States  an area he refers to as  Renewistan.  A guy who's added it up all this very well is David Mackay  a physicist in England  and in his wonderful book   Sustainable Energy   among other things  he says   I'm not trying to be pro nuclear. I'm just pro arithmetic.  In terms of weapons  the best disarmament tool so far is nuclear energy. We have been taking down the Russian warheads  turning it into electricity. Ten percent of American electricity comes from decommissioned warheads. We haven't even started the American stockpile. I think of most interest to a TED audience would be the new generation of reactors that are very small  down around    to     megawatts. This is one from Toshiba. Here's one the Russians are already building that floats on a barge. And that would be very interesting in the developing world. Typically  these things are put in the ground. They're referred to as nuclear batteries. They're incredibly safe  weapons proliferation proof and all the rest of it. Here is a commercial version from New Mexico called the Hyperion  and another one from Oregon called NuScale. Babcock   Wilcox that make nuclear reactors  here's an integral fast reactor. Thorium reactor that Nathan Myhrvold's involved in. The governments of the world are going to have to decide that coals need to be made expensive  and these will go ahead. And here's the future. CA  Okay. Okay. So arguing against  a man who's been at the nitty  gritty heart of the energy debate and the climate change debate for years. In       he discovered that soot was probably the second leading cause of global warming  after CO . His team have been making detailed calculations of the relative impacts of different energy sources. His first time at TED  possibly a disadvantage    we shall see    from Stanford  Professor Mark Jacobson. Good luck. Mark Jacobson  Thank you. So my premise here is that nuclear energy puts out more carbon dioxide  puts out more air pollutants  enhances mortality more and takes longer to put up than real renewable energy systems  namely wind  solar  geothermal power  hydro tidal wave power. And it also enhances nuclear weapons proliferation. So let's start just by looking at the CO  emissions from the life cycle. CO e emissions are equivalent emissions of all the greenhouse gases and particles that cause warming and converted to CO . And if you look  wind and concentrated solar have the lowest CO  emissions  if you look at the graph. Nuclear    there are two bars here. One is a low estimate  and one is a high estimate. The low estimate is the nuclear energy industry estimate of nuclear. The high is the average of     scientific  peer reviewed studies. And this is just the CO  from the life cycle. If we look at the delays  it takes between    and    years to put up a nuclear power plant from planning to operation. This includes about three and a half to six years for a site permit. and another two and a half to four years for a construction permit and issue  and then four to nine years for actual construction. And in China  right now  they're putting up five gigawatts of nuclear. And the average  just for the construction time of these  is  .  years on top of any planning times. While you're waiting around for your nuclear  you have to run the regular electric power grid  which is mostly coal in the United States and around the world. And the chart here shows the difference between the emissions from the regular grid  resulting if you use nuclear  or anything else  versus wind  CSP or photovoltaics. Wind takes about two to five years on average  same as concentrated solar and photovoltaics. So the difference is the opportunity cost of using nuclear versus wind  or something else. So if you add these two together  alone  you can see a separation that nuclear puts out at least nine to    times more CO  equivalent emissions than wind energy. And this doesn't even account for the footprint on the ground. If you look at the air pollution health effects  this is the number of deaths per year in      just from vehicle exhaust. Let's say we converted all the vehicles in the United States to battery electric vehicles  hydrogen fuel cell vehicles or flex fuel vehicles run on E  . Well  right now in the United States     to         people die per year from air pollution  and vehicles are about        of those. In       the number will go down to        due to improvements. And so  on the right  you see gasoline emissions  the death rates of     . If you go to corn or cellulosic ethanol  you'd actually increase the death rate slightly. If you go to nuclear  you do get a big reduction  but it's not as much as with wind and concentrated solar. Now if you consider the fact that nuclear weapons proliferation is associated with nuclear energy proliferation  because we know for example  India and Pakistan developed nuclear weapons secretly by enriching uranium in nuclear energy facilities. North Korea did that to some extent. Iran is doing that right now. And Venezuela would be doing it if they started with their nuclear energy facilities. If you do a large scale expansion of nuclear energy across the world  and as a result there was just one nuclear bomb created that was used to destroy a city such as Mumbai or some other big city  megacity  the additional death rates due to this averaged over    years and then scaled to the population of the U.S. would be this. So  do we need this  The next thing is  What about the footprint  Stewart mentioned the footprint. Actually  the footprint on the ground for wind is by far the smallest of any energy source in the world. That  because the footprint  as you can see  is just the pole touching the ground. And you can power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet with        to         five megawatt wind turbines. That would take between one and three square kilometers of footprint on the ground  entirely. The spacing is something else. That's the footprint that is always being confused. People confuse footprint with spacing. As you can see from these pictures  the spacing between can be used for multiple purposes including agricultural land  range land or open space. Over the ocean  it's not even land. Now if we look at nuclear     Laughter  With nuclear  what do we have  We have facilities around there. You also have a buffer zone that's    square kilometers. And you have the uranium mining that you have to deal with. Now if we go to the area  lots is worse than nuclear or wind. For example  cellulosic ethanol  to power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet  this is how much land you would need. That's cellulosic  second generation biofuels from prairie grass. Here's corn ethanol. It's smaller. This is based on ranges from data  but if you look at nuclear  it would be the size of Rhode Island to power the U.S. vehicle fleet. For wind  there's a larger area  but much smaller footprint. And of course  with wind  you could put it all over the East Coast  offshore theoretically  or you can split it up. And now  if you go back to looking at geothermal  it's even smaller than both  and solar is slightly larger than the nuclear spacing  but it's still pretty small. And this is to power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet. To power the entire world with    percent wind  you would need about one percent of world land. Matching the reliability  base load is actually irrelevant. We want to match the hour by hour power supply. You can do that by combining renewables. This is from real data in California  looking at wind data and solar data. And it considers just using existing hydro to match the hour by hour power demand. Here are the world wind resources. There's five to    times more wind available worldwide than we need for all the world. So then here's the final ranking. And one last slide I just want to show. This is the choice  You can either have wind or nuclear. If you use wind  you guarantee ice will last. Nuclear  the time lag alone will allow the Arctic to melt and other places to melt more. And we can guarantee a clean  blue sky or an uncertain future with nuclear power. CA  All right. So while they're having their comebacks on each other    and yours is slightly short because you slightly overran    I need two people from either side. So if you're for this  if you're for nuclear power  put up two hands. If you're against  put up one. And I want two of each for the mics. Now then  you guys have    you have a minute comeback on him to pick up a point he said  challenge it  whatever. SB  I think a point of difference we're having  Mark  has to do with weapons and energy. These diagrams that show that nuclear is somehow putting out a lot of greenhouse gases    a lot of those studies include   Well of course war will be inevitable and therefore we'll have cities burning and stuff like that   which is kind of finessing it a little bit  I think. The reality is that there's  what     nations that have nuclear power  Of those  seven have nuclear weapons. In every case  they got the weapons before they got the nuclear power. There are two nations  North Korea and Israel  that have nuclear weapons and don't have nuclear power at all. The places that we would most like to have really clean energy occur are China  India  Europe  North America  all of which have sorted out their situation in relation to nuclear weapons. So that leaves a couple of places like Iran  maybe Venezuela  that you would like to have very close surveillance of anything that goes on with fissile stuff. Pushing ahead with nuclear power will mean we really know where all of the fissile material is  and we can move toward zero weapons left  once we know all that. CA  Mark     seconds  either on that or on anything Stewart said. MJ  Well we know India and Pakistan had nuclear energy first  and then they developed nuclear weapons secretly in the factories. So the other thing is  we don't need nuclear energy. There's plenty of solar and wind. You can make it reliable  as I showed with that diagram. That's from real data. And this is an ongoing research. This is not rocket science. Solving the world's problems can be done  if you really put your mind to it and use clean  renewable energy. There's absolutely no need for nuclear power. CA  We need someone for. Rod Beckstrom  Thank you Chris. I'm Rod Beckstrom  CEO of ICANN. I've been involved in global warming policy since       when I joined the board of Environmental Defense Fund that was one of the crafters of the Kyoto Protocol. And I want to support Stewart Brand's position. I've come around in the last    years. I used to be against nuclear power. I'm now supporting Stewart's position  softly  from a risk management standpoint  agreeing that the risks of overheating the planet outweigh the risk of nuclear incident  which certainly is possible and is a very real problem. However  I think there may be a win win solution here where both parties can win this debate  and that is  we face a situation where it's carbon caps on this planet or die. And in the United States Senate  we need bipartisan support    only one or two votes are needed    to move global warming through the Senate  and this room can help. So if we get that through  then Mark will solve these problems. Thanks Chris. CA  Thank you Rod Beckstrom. Against. David Fanton  Hi  I'm David Fanton. I just want to say a couple quick things. The first is  be aware of the propaganda. The propaganda from the industry has been very  very strong. And we have not had the other side of the argument fully aired so that people can draw their own conclusions. Be very aware of the propaganda. Secondly  think about this. If we build all these nuclear power plants  all that waste is going to be on hundreds  if not thousands  of trucks and trains  moving through this country every day. Tell me they're not going to have accidents. Tell me that those accidents aren't going to put material into the environment that is poisonous for hundreds of thousands of years. And then tell me that each and every one of those trucks and trains isn't a potential terrorist target. CA  Thank you. For. Anyone else for  Go. Alex  Hi  I'm Alex. I just wanted to say  I'm  first of all  renewable energy's biggest fan. I've got solar PV on my roof. I've got a hydro conversion at a watermill that I own. And I'm  you know  very much  pro  that kind of stuff. However  there's a basic arithmetic problem here. The capability of the sun shining  the wind blowing and the rain falling  simply isn't enough to add up. So if we want to keep the lights on  we actually need a solution which is going to keep generating all of the time. I campaigned against nuclear weapons in the '  s  and I continue to do so now. But we've got an opportunity to recycle them into something more useful that enables us to get energy all of the time. And  ultimately  the arithmetic problem isn't going to go away. We're not going to get enough energy from renewables alone. We need a solution that generates all of the time. If we're going to keep the lights on  nuclear is that solution. CA  Thank you. Anyone else against  Man  The last person who was in favor made the premise that we don't have enough alternative renewable resources. And our  against  proponent up here made it very clear that we actually do. And so the fallacy that we need this resource and we can actually make it in a time frame that is meaningful is not possible. I will also add one other thing. Ray Kurzweil and all the other talks    we know that the stick is going up exponentially. So you can't look at state of the art technologies in renewables and say   That's all we have.  Because five years from now  it will blow you away what we'll actually have as alternatives to this horrible  disastrous nuclear power. CA  Point well made. Thank you. So each of you has really just a couple sentences       seconds each to sum up. Your final pitch  Stewart. SB  I loved your  It all balances out  chart that you had there. It was a sunny day and a windy night. And just now in England they had a cold spell. All of the wind in the entire country shut down for a week. None of those things were stirring. And as usual  they had to buy nuclear power from France. Two gigawatts comes through the Chunnel. This keeps happening. I used to worry about the        year factor. And the fact is  we're going to use the nuclear waste we have for fuel in the fourth generation of reactors that are coming along. And especially the small reactors need to go forward. I heard from Nathan Myhrvold    and I think here's the action point    it'll take an act of Congress to make the Nuclear Regulatory Commission start moving quickly on these small reactors  which we need very much  here and in the world. MJ  So we've analyzed the hour by hour power demand and supply  looking at solar  wind  using data for California. And you can match that demand  hour by hour  for the whole year almost. Now  with regard to the resources  we've developed the first wind map of the world  from data alone  at    meters. We know what the wind resources are. You can cover    percent. Fifteen percent of the entire U.S. has wind at fast enough speeds to be cost competitive. And there's much more solar than there is wind. There's plenty of resource. You can make it reliable. CA  Okay. So  thank you  Mark. So if you were in Palm Springs ... Shameless. Shameless. Shameless. So  people of the TED community  I put it to you that what the world needs now is nuclear energy. All those in favor  raise your hands. And all those against. Ooooh. Now that is    my take on that ... Just put up ... Hands up  people who changed their minds during the debate  who voted differently. Those of you who changed your mind in favor of  for  put your hands up. Okay. So here's the read on it. Both people won supporters  but on my count  the mood of the TED community shifted from about    to    to about    to    in favor  in favor. You both won. I congratulate both of you. Thank you for that. This is the venue where  as a young man  some of the music that I wrote was first performed. It was  remarkably  a pretty good sounding room. With all the uneven walls and all the crap everywhere  it actually sounded pretty good. This is a song that was recorded there. This is not Talking Heads  in the picture anyway. So the nature of the room meant that words could be understood. The lyrics of the songs could be pretty much understood. The sound system was kind of decent. And there wasn't a lot of reverberation in the room. So the rhythms could be pretty intact too  pretty concise. Other places around the country had similar rooms. This is Tootsie's Orchid Lounge in Nashville. The music was in some ways different  but in structure and form  very much the same. The clientele behavior was very much the same too. And so the bands at Tootsie's or at CBGB's had to play loud enough    the volume had to be loud enough to overcome people falling down  shouting out and doing whatever else they were doing. Since then  I've played other places that are much nicer. I've played the Disney Hall here and Carnegie Hall and places like that. And it's been very exciting. But I also noticed that sometimes the music that I had written  or was writing at the time  didn't sound all that great in some of those halls. We managed  but sometimes those halls didn't seem exactly suited to the music I was making or had made. So I asked myself  Do I write stuff for specific rooms  Do I have a place  a venue  in mind when I write  Is that a kind of model for creativity  Do we all make things with a venue  a context  in mind  Okay  Africa. Most of the popular music that we know now has a big part of its roots in West Africa. And the music there  I would say  the instruments  the intricate rhythms  the way it's played  the setting  the context  it's all perfect. It all works perfect. The music works perfectly in that setting. There's no big room to create reverberation and confuse the rhythms. The instruments are loud enough that they can be heard without amplification  etc.  etc. It's no accident. It's perfect for that particular context. And it would be a mess in a context like this. This is a gothic cathedral. In a gothic cathedral  this kind of music is perfect. It doesn't change key  the notes are long  there's almost no rhythm whatsoever  and the room flatters the music. It actually improves it. This is the room that Bach wrote some of his music for. This is the organ. It's not as big as a gothic cathedral  so he can write things that are a little bit more intricate. He can  very innovatively  actually change keys without risking huge dissonances. This is a little bit later. This is the kind of rooms that Mozart wrote in. I think we're in like       somewhere around there. They're smaller  even less reverberant  so he can write really frilly music that's very intricate    and it works. It fits the room perfectly. This is La Scala. It's around the same time  I think it was built around     . People in the audience in these opera houses  when they were built  they used to yell out to one another. They used to eat  drink and yell out to people on the stage  just like they do at CBGB's and places like that. If they liked an aria  they would holler and suggest that it be done again as an encore  not at the end of the show  but immediately. And well  that was an opera experience. This is the opera house that Wagner built for himself. And the size of the room is not that big. It's smaller than this. But Wagner made an innovation. He wanted a bigger band. He wanted a little more bombast  so he increased the size of the orchestra pit so he could get more low end instruments in there. Okay. This is Carnegie Hall. Obviously  this kind of thing became popular. The halls got bigger. Carnegie Hall's fair sized. It's larger than some of the other symphony halls. And they're a lot more reverberant than La Scala. Around the same  according to Alex Ross who writes for the New Yorker  this kind of rule came into effect that audiences had to be quiet    no more eating  drinking and yelling at the stage  or gossiping with one another during the show. They had to be very quiet. So those two things combined meant that a different kind of music worked best in these kind of halls. It meant that there could be extreme dynamics  which there weren't in some of these other kinds of music. Quiet parts could be heard that would have been drowned out by all the gossiping and shouting. But because of the reverberation in those rooms like Carnegie Hall  the music had to be maybe a little less rhythmic and a little more textural. This is Mahler. It looks like Bob Dylan  but it's Mahler. That was Bob's last record  yeah. Popular music  coming along at the same time. This is a jazz band. According to Scott Joplin  the bands were playing on riverboats and clubs. Again  it's noisy. They're playing for dancers. There's certain sections of the song    the songs had different sections that the dancers really liked. And they'd say   Play that part again.  Well  there's only so many times you can play the same section of a song over and over again for the dancers. So the bands started to improvise new melodies. And a new form of music was born. These are played mainly in small rooms. People are dancing  shouting and drinking. So the music has to be loud enough to be heard above that. Same thing goes true for    that's the beginning of the century    for the whole of   th century popular music  whether it's rock or Latin music or whatever.  Live music  doesn't really change that much. It changes about a third of the way into the   th century  when this became one of the primary venues for music. And this was one way that the music got there. Microphones enabled singers  in particular  and musicians and composers  to completely change the kind of music that they were writing. So far  a lot of the stuff that was on the radio was live music  but singers  like Frank Sinatra  could use the mic and do things that they could never do without a microphone. Other singers after him went even further. This is Chet Baker. And this kind of thing would have been impossible without a microphone. It would have been impossible without recorded music as well. And he's singing right into your ear. He's whispering into your ears. The effect is just electric. It's like the guy is sitting next to you  whispering who knows what into your ear. So at this point  music diverged. There's live music  and there's recorded music. And they no longer have to be exactly the same. Now there's venues like this  a discotheque  and there's jukeboxes in bars  where you don't even need to have a band. There doesn't need to be any live performing musicians whatsoever  and the sound systems are good. People began to make music specifically for discos and for those sound systems. And  as with jazz  the dancers liked certain sections more than they did others. So the early hip hop guys would loop certain sections. The MC would improvise lyrics in the same way that the jazz players would improvise melodies. And another new form of music was born. Live performance  when it was incredibly successful  ended up in what is probably  acoustically  the worst sounding venues on the planet  sports stadiums  basketball arenas and hockey arenas. Musicians who ended up there did the best they could. They wrote what is now called arena rock  which is medium speed ballads. They did the best they could given that this is what they're writing for. The tempos are medium. It sounds big. It's more a social situation than a musical situation. And in some ways  the music that they're writing for this place works perfectly. So there's more new venues. One of the new ones is the automobile. I grew up with a radio in a car. But now that's evolved into something else. The car is a whole venue. The music that  I would say  is written for automobile sound systems works perfectly on it. It might not be what you want to listen to at home  but it works great in the car    has a huge frequency spectrum  you know  big bass and high end and the voice kind of stuck in the middle. Automobile music  you can share with your friends. There's one other kind of new venue  the private MP  player. Presumably  this is just for Christian music. And in some ways it's like Carnegie Hall  or when the audience had to hush up  because you can now hear every single detail. In other ways  it's more like the West African music because if the music in an MP  player gets too quiet  you turn it up  and the next minute  your ears are blasted out by a louder passage. So that doesn't really work. I think pop music  mainly  it's written today  to some extent  is written for these kind of players  for this kind of personal experience where you can hear extreme detail  but the dynamic doesn't change that much. So I asked myself  Okay  is this a model for creation  this adaptation that we do  And does it happen anywhere else  Well  according to David Attenborough and some other people  birds do it too    that the birds in the canopy  where the foliage is dense  their calls tend to be high pitched  short and repetitive. And the birds on the floor tend to have lower pitched calls  so that they don't get distorted when they bounce off the forest floor. And birds like this Savannah sparrow  they tend to have a buzzing type call. And it turns out that a sound like this is the most energy efficient and practical way to transmit their call across the fields and savannahs. Other birds  like this tanager  have adapted within the same species. The tananger on the East Coast of the United States  where the forests are a little denser  has one kind of call  and the tananger on the other side  on the west has a different kind of call. So birds do it too. And I thought  Well  if this is a model for creation  if we make music  primarily the form at least  to fit these contexts  and if we make art to fit gallery walls or museum walls  and if we write software to fit existing operating systems  is that how it works  Yeah. I think it's evolutionary. It's adaptive. But the pleasure and the passion and the joy is still there. This is a reverse view of things from the kind of traditional Romantic view. The Romantic view is that first comes the passion and then the outpouring of emotion  and then somehow it gets shaped into something. And I'm saying  well  the passion's still there  but the vessel that it's going to be injected into and poured into  that is instinctively and intuitively created first. We already know where that passion is going. But this conflict of views is kind of interesting. The writer  Thomas Frank  says that this might be a kind of explanation why some voters vote against their best interests  that voters  like a lot of us  assume  that if they hear something that sounds like it's sincere  that it's coming from the gut  that it's passionate  that it's more authentic. And they'll vote for that. So that  if somebody can fake sincerity  if they can fake passion  they stand a better chance of being selected in that way  which seems a little dangerous. I'm saying the two  the passion  the joy  are not mutually exclusive. Maybe what the world needs now is for us to realize that we are like the birds. We adapt. We sing. And like the birds  the joy is still there  even though we have changed what we do to fit the context. Thank you very much. So since I was here last in '    we discovered that global climate change is turning out to be a pretty serious issue  so we covered that fairly extensively in Skeptic magazine. We investigate all kinds of scientific and quasi scientific controversies  but it turns out we don't have to worry about any of this because the world's going to end in     . Another update  You will recall I introduced you guys to the Quadro Tracker. It's like a water dowsing device. It's just a hollow piece of plastic with an antenna that swivels around. And you walk around  and it points to things. Like if you're looking for marijuana in students' lockers  it'll point right to somebody. Oh  sorry.  Laughter  This particular one that was given to me finds golf balls  especially if you're at a golf course and you check under enough bushes. Well  under the category of  What's the harm of silly stuff like this   this device  the ADE      was sold to the Iraqi government for        dollars apiece. It's just like this one  completely worthless  in which it allegedly worked by  electrostatic magnetic ion attraction   which translates to  pseudoscientific baloney     would be the nice word    in which you string together a bunch of words that sound good  but it does absolutely nothing. In this case  at trespass points  allowing people to go through because your little tracker device said they were okay  actually cost lives. So there is a danger to pseudoscience  in believing in this sort of thing. So what I want to talk about today is belief. I want to believe  and you do too. And in fact  I think my thesis here is that belief is the natural state of things. It is the default option. We just believe. We believe all sorts of things. Belief is natural  disbelief  skepticism  science  is not natural. It's more difficult. It's uncomfortable to not believe things. So like Fox Mulder on  X Files   who wants to believe in UFOs  Well  we all do  and the reason for that is because we have a belief engine in our brains. Essentially  we are pattern seeking primates. We connect the dots  A is connected to B  B is connected to C. And sometimes A really is connected to B  and that's called association learning. We find patterns  we make those connections  whether it's Pavlov's dog here associating the sound of the bell with the food  and then he salivates to the sound of the bell  or whether it's a Skinnerian rat  in which he's having an association between his behavior and a reward for it  and therefore he repeats the behavior. In fact  what Skinner discovered is that  if you put a pigeon in a box like this  and he has to press one of these two keys  and he tries to figure out what the pattern is  and you give him a little reward in the hopper box there    if you just randomly assign rewards such that there is no pattern  they will figure out any kind of pattern. And whatever they were doing just before they got the reward  they repeat that particular pattern. Sometimes it was even spinning around twice counterclockwise  once clockwise and peck the key twice. And that's called superstition  and that  I'm afraid  we will always have with us. I call this process  patternicity     that is  the tendency to find meaningful patterns in both meaningful and meaningless noise. When we do this process  we make two types of errors. A Type I error  or false positive  is believing a pattern is real when it's not. Our second type of error is a false negative. A Type II error is not believing a pattern is real when it is. So let's do a thought experiment. You are a hominid three million years ago walking on the plains of Africa. Your name is Lucy  okay  And you hear a rustle in the grass. Is it a dangerous predator  or is it just the wind  Your next decision could be the most important one of your life. Well  if you think that the rustle in the grass is a dangerous predator and it turns out it's just the wind  you've made an error in cognition  made a Type I error  false positive. But no harm. You just move away. You're more cautious. You're more vigilant. On the other hand  if you believe that the rustle in the grass is just the wind  and it turns out it's a dangerous predator  you're lunch. You've just won a Darwin award. You've been taken out of the gene pool. Now the problem here is that patternicities will occur whenever the cost of making a Type I error is less than the cost of making a Type II error. This is the only equation in the talk by the way. We have a pattern detection problem that is assessing the difference between a Type I and a Type II error is highly problematic  especially in split second  life and death situations. So the default position is just  Believe all patterns are real    All rustles in the grass are dangerous predators and not just the wind. And so I think that we evolved ... there was a natural selection for the propensity for our belief engines  our pattern seeking brain processes  to always find meaningful patterns and infuse them with these sort of predatory or intentional agencies that I'll come back to. So for example  what do you see here  It's a horse head  that's right. It looks like a horse. It must be a horse. That's a pattern. And is it really a horse  Or is it more like a frog  See  our pattern detection device  which appears to be located in the anterior cingulate cortex    it's our little detection device there    can be easily fooled  and this is the problem. For example  what do you see here  Yes  of course  it's a cow. Once I prime the brain    it's called cognitive priming    once I prime the brain to see it  it pops back out again even without the pattern that I've imposed on it. And what do you see here  Some people see a Dalmatian dog. Yes  there it is. And there's the prime. So when I go back without the prime  your brain already has the model so you can see it again. What do you see here  Planet Saturn. Yes  that's good. How about here  Just shout out anything you see. That's a good audience  Chris. Because there's nothing in this. Well  allegedly there's nothing. This is an experiment done by Jennifer Whitson at U.T. Austin on corporate environments and whether feelings of uncertainty and out of control makes people see illusory patterns. That is  almost everybody sees the planet Saturn. People that are put in a condition of feeling out of control are more likely to see something in this  which is allegedly patternless. In other words  the propensity to find these patterns goes up when there's a lack of control. For example  baseball players are notoriously superstitious when they're batting  but not so much when they're fielding. Because fielders are successful    to    percent of the time. The best batters fail seven out of    times. So their superstitions  their patternicities  are all associated with feelings of lack of control and so forth. What do you see in this particular one here  in this field  Anybody see an object there  There actually is something here  but it's degraded. While you're thinking about that  this was an experiment done by Susan Blackmore  a psychologist in England  who showed subjects this degraded image and then ran a correlation between their scores on an ESP test  How much did they believe in the paranormal  supernatural  angels and so forth. And those who scored high on the ESP scale  tended to not only see more patterns in the degraded images but incorrect patterns. Here is what you show subjects. The fish is degraded    percent     percent and then the one I showed you     percent. A similar experiment was done by another  Swiss  psychologist named Peter Brugger  who found significantly more meaningful patterns were perceived on the right hemisphere  via the left visual field  than the left hemisphere. So if you present subjects the images such that it's going to end up on the right hemisphere instead of the left  then they're more likely to see patterns than if you put it on the left hemisphere. Our right hemisphere appears to be where a lot of this patternicity occurs. So what we're trying to do is bore into the brain to see where all this happens. Brugger and his colleague  Christine Mohr  gave subjects L DOPA. L DOPA's a drug  as you know  given for treating Parkinson's disease  which is related to a decrease in dopamine. L DOPA increases dopamine. An increase of dopamine caused subjects to see more patterns than those that did not receive the dopamine. So dopamine appears to be the drug associated with patternicity. In fact  neuroleptic drugs that are used to eliminate psychotic behavior  things like paranoia  delusions and hallucinations  these are patternicities. They're incorrect patterns. They're false positives. They're Type I errors. And if you give them drugs that are dopamine antagonists  they go away. That is  you decrease the amount of dopamine  and their tendency to see patterns like that decreases. On the other hand  amphetamines like cocaine are dopamine agonists. They increase the amount of dopamine. So you're more likely to feel in a euphoric state  creativity  find more patterns. In fact  I saw Robin Williams recently talk about how he thought he was much funnier when he was doing cocaine  when he had that issue  than now. So perhaps more dopamine is related to more creativity. Dopamine  I think  changes our signal to noise ratio. That is  how accurate we are in finding patterns. If it's too low  you're more likely to make too many Type II errors. You miss the real patterns. You don't want to be too skeptical. If you're too skeptical  you'll miss the really interesting good ideas. Just right  you're creative  and yet you don't fall for too much baloney. Too high and maybe you see patterns everywhere. Every time somebody looks at you  you think people are staring at you. You think people are talking about you. And if you go too far on that  that's just simply labeled as madness. It's a distinction perhaps we might make between two Nobel laureates  Richard Feynman and John Nash. One sees maybe just the right number of patterns to win a Nobel Prize. The other one also  but maybe too many patterns. And we then call that schizophrenia. So the signal to noise ratio then presents us with a pattern detection problem. And of course you all know exactly what this is  right  And what pattern do you see here  Again  I'm putting your anterior cingulate cortex to the test here  causing you conflicting pattern detections. You know  of course  this is Via Uno shoes. These are sandals. Pretty sexy feet  I must say. Maybe a little Photoshopped. And of course  the ambiguous figures that seem to flip flop back and forth. It turns out what you're thinking about a lot influences what you tend to see. And you see the lamp here  I know. Because the lights on here. Of course  thanks to the environmentalist movement we're all sensitive to the plight of marine mammals. So what you see in this particular ambiguous figure is  of course  the dolphins  right  You see a dolphin here  and there's a dolphin  and there's a dolphin. That's a dolphin tail there  guys. If we can give you conflicting data  again  your ACC is going to be going into hyperdrive. If you look down here  it's fine. If you look up here  then you get conflicting data. And then we have to flip the image for you to see that it's a set up. The impossible crate illusion. It's easy to fool the brain in  D. So you say   Aw  come on Shermer  anybody can do that in a Psych     text with an illusion like that.  Well here's the late  great Jerry Andrus'  impossible crate  illusion in  D  in which Jerry is standing inside the impossible crate. And he was kind enough to post this and give us the reveal. Of course  camera angle is everything. The photographer is over there  and this board appears to overlap with this one  and this one with that one  and so on. But even when I take it away  the illusion is so powerful because of how are brains are wired to find those certain kinds of patterns. This is a fairly new one that throws us off because of the conflicting patterns of comparing this angle with that angle. In fact  it's the exact same picture side by side. So what you're doing is comparing that angle instead of with this one  but with that one. And so your brain is fooled. Yet again  your pattern detection devices are fooled. Faces are easy to see because we have an additional evolved facial recognition software in our temporal lobes. Here's some faces on the side of a rock. I'm actually not even sure if this is    this might be Photoshopped. But anyway  the point is still made. Now which one of these looks odd to you  In a quick reaction  which one looks odd  The one on the left. Okay. So I'll rotate it so it'll be the one on the right. And you are correct. A fairly famous illusion    it was first done with Margaret Thatcher. Now  they trade up the politicians every time. Well  why is this happening  Well  we know exactly where it happens  in the temporal lobe  right across  sort of above your ear there  in a little structure called the fusiform gyrus. And there's two types of cells that do this  that record facial features either globally  or specifically these large  rapid firing cells  first look at the general face. So you recognize Obama immediately. And then you notice something quite a little bit odd about the eyes and the mouth. Especially when they're upside down  you're engaging that general facial recognition software there. Now I said back in our little thought experiment  you're a hominid walking on the plains of Africa. Is it just the wind or a dangerous predator  What's the difference between those  Well  the wind is inanimate  the dangerous predator is an intentional agent. And I call this process agenticity. That is the tendency to infuse patterns with meaning  intention and agency  often invisible beings from the top down. This is an idea that we got from a fellow TEDster here  Dan Dennett  who talked about taking the intentional stance. So it's a type of that expanded to explain  I think  a lot of different things  souls  spirits  ghosts  gods  demons  angels  aliens  intelligent designers  government conspiracists and all manner of invisible agents with power and intention  are believed to haunt our world and control our lives. I think it's the basis of animism and polytheism and monotheism. It's the belief that aliens are somehow more advanced than us  more moral than us  and the narratives always are that they're coming here to save us and rescue us from on high. The intelligent designer's always portrayed as this super intelligent  moral being that comes down to design life. Even the idea that government can rescue us    that's no longer the wave of the future  but that is  I think  a type of agenticity  projecting somebody up there  big and powerful  will come rescue us. And this is also  I think  the basis of conspiracy theories. There's somebody hiding behind there pulling the strings  whether it's the Illuminati or the Bilderbergers. But this is a pattern detection problem  isn't it  Some patterns are real and some are not. Was JFK assassinated by a conspiracy or by a lone assassin  Well  if you go there    there's people there on any given day    like when I went there  here    showing me where the different shooters were. My favorite one was he was in the manhole. And he popped out at the last second  took that shot. But of course  Lincoln was assassinated by a conspiracy. So we can't just uniformly dismiss all patterns like that. Because  let's face it  some patterns are real. Some conspiracies really are true. Explains a lot  maybe. And      has a conspiracy theory. It is a conspiracy. We did a whole issue on it. Nineteen members of Al Queda plotting to fly planes into buildings constitutes a conspiracy. But that's not what the       truthers  think. They think it was an inside job by the Bush administration. Well  that's a whole other lecture. You know how we know that      was not orchestrated by the Bush administration  Because it worked. So we are natural born dualists. Our agenticity process comes from the fact that we can enjoy movies like these. Because we can imagine  in essence  continuing on. We know that if you stimulate the temporal lobe  you can produce a feeling of out of body experiences  near death experiences  which you can do by just touching an electrode to the temporal lobe there. Or you can do it through loss of consciousness  by accelerating in a centrifuge. You get a hypoxia  or a lower oxygen. And the brain then senses that there's an out of body experience. You can use    which I did  went out and did    Michael Persinger's God Helmet  that bombards your temporal lobes with electromagnetic waves. And you get a sense of out of body experience. So I'm going to end here with a short video clip that sort of brings all this together. It's just a minute and a half. It ties together all this into the power of expectation and the power of belief. Go ahead and roll it. Narrator  This is the venue they chose for their fake auditions for an advert for lip balm. Woman  We're hoping we can use part of this in a national commercial  right  And this is test on some lip balms that we have over here. And these are our models who are going to help us  Roger and Matt. And we have our own lip balm  and we have a leading brand. Would you have any problem kissing our models to test it  Girl  No. Woman  You wouldn't   Girl  No.  Woman  You'd think that was fine. Girl  That would be fine.  Woman  Okay.  So this is a blind test. I'm going to ask you to go ahead and put a blindfold on. Kay  now can you see anything   Girl  No.  Pull it so you can't even see down.  Girl  Okay.  Woman  It's completely blind now  right  Girl  Yes.  Woman  Okay.  Now  what I'm going to be looking for in this test is how it protects your lips  the texture  right  and maybe if you can discern any flavor or not. Girl  Okay.  Woman  Have you ever done a kissing test before   Girl  No. Woman  Take a step here. Okay  now I'm going to ask you to pucker up. Pucker up big and lean in just a little bit  okay  Woman  Okay. And  Jennifer  how did that feel  Jennifer  Good. Girl  Oh my God  Michael Shermer  Thank you very much. Thank you. Thanks. So  if you're in the audience today  or maybe you're watching this talk in some other time or place  you are a participant in the digital rights ecosystem. Whether you're an artist  a technologist  a lawyer or a fan  the handling of copyright directly impacts your life. Rights management is no longer simply a question of ownership  it's a complex web of relationships and a critical part of our cultural landscape. YouTube cares deeply about the rights of content owners  but in order to give them choices about what they can do with copies  mashups and more  we need to first identify when copyrighted material is uploaded to our site. Let's look at a specific video so you can see how it works. Two years ago  recording artist Chris Brown released the official video of his single  Forever.  A fan saw it on TV  recorded it with her camera phone  and uploaded it to YouTube. Because Sony Music had registered Chris Brown's video in our Content ID system  within seconds of attempting to upload the video  the copy was detected  giving Sony the choice of what to do next. But how do we know that the user's video was a copy  Well  it starts with content owners delivering assets into our database  along with a usage policy that tells us what to do when we find a match. We compare each upload against all of the reference files in our database. This heat map is going to show you how the brain of the system works. Here we can see the original reference file being compared to the user generated content. The system compares every moment of one to the other to see if there's a match. This means that we can identify a match even if the copy used is just a portion of the original file  plays it in slow motion and has degraded audio and video quality. And we do this every time that a video is uploaded to YouTube. And that's over    hours of video every minute. When we find a match  we apply the policy that the rights owner has set down. And the scale and the speed of this system is truly breathtaking. We're not just talking about a few videos  we're talking about over     years of video every day  between new uploads and the legacy scans we regularly do across all of the content on the site. When we compare those hundred years of video  we're comparing it against millions of reference files in our database. It would be like        people staring at        monitors each and every day  without so much as a coffee break. Now  what do we do when we find a match  Well  most rights owners  instead of blocking  will allow the copy to be published. And then they benefit through the exposure  advertising and linked sales. Remember Chris Brown's video  Forever   Well  it had its day in the sun and then it dropped off the charts  and that looked like the end of the story  but sometime last year  a young couple got married. This is their wedding video. You may have seen it. What's amazing about this is  if the processional of the wedding was this much fun  can you imagine how much fun the reception must have been  I mean  who are these people  I totally want to go to that wedding. So their little wedding video went on to get over    million views. And instead of Sony blocking  they allowed the upload to occur. And they put advertising against it and linked from it to iTunes. And the song     months old  went back to number four on the iTunes charts. So Sony is generating revenue from both of these. And Jill and Kevin  the happy couple  they came back from their honeymoon and found that their video had gone crazy viral. And they've ended up on a bunch of talk shows  and they've used it as an opportunity to make a difference. The video's inspired over        dollars in donations to end domestic violence. The  JK Wedding  Entrance  Dance  became so popular that NBC parodied it on the season finale of  The Office   which just goes to show  it's truly an ecosystem of culture. Because it's not just amateurs borrowing from big studios  but sometimes big studios borrowing back. By empowering choice  we can create a culture of opportunity. And all it took to change things around was to allow for choice through rights identification. So why has no one ever solved this problem before  It's because it's a big problem  and it's complicated and messy. It's not uncommon for a single video to have multiple rights owners. There's musical labels. There's multiple music publishers. And each of these can vary by country. There's lots of cases where we have more than one work mashed together. So we have to manage many claims to the same video. YouTube's Content ID system addresses all of these cases. But the system only works through the participation of rights owners. If you have content that others are uploading to YouTube  you should register in the Content ID system  and then you'll have the choice about how your content is used. And think carefully about the policies that you attach to that content. By simply blocking all reuse  you'll miss out on new art forms  new audiences  new distribution channels and new revenue streams. But it's not just about dollars and impressions. Just look at all the joy that was spread through progressive rights management and new technology. And I think we can all agree that joy is definitely an idea worth spreading. Thank you. Thank you so much. I'm going to try to take you on a journey of the underwater acoustic world of whales and dolphins. Since we are such a visual species  it's hard for us to really understand this  so I'll use a mixture of figures and sounds and hope this can communicate it. But let's also think  as a visual species  what it's like when we go snorkeling or diving and try to look underwater. We really can't see very far. Our vision  which works so well in air  all of a sudden is very restricted and claustrophobic. And what marine mammals have evolved over the last tens of millions of years is ways to depend on sound to both explore their world and also to stay in touch with one another. Dolphins and toothed whales use echolocation. They can produce loud clicks and listen for echoes from the sea floor in order to orient. They can listen for echoes from prey in order to decide where food is and to decide which one they want to eat. All marine mammals use sound for communication to stay in touch. So the large baleen whales will produce long  beautiful songs  which are used in reproductive advertisement for male and females  both to find one another and to select a mate. And mother and young and closely bonded animals use calls to stay in touch with one another  so sound is really critical for their lives. The first thing that got me interested in the sounds of these underwater animals  whose world was so foreign to me  was evidence from captive dolphins that captive dolphins could imitate human sounds. And I mentioned I'll use some visual representations of sounds. Here's the first example. This is a plot of frequency against time    sort of like musical notation  where the higher notes are up higher and the lower notes are lower  and time goes this way. This is a picture of a trainer's whistle  a whistle a trainer will blow to tell a dolphin it's done the right thing and can come get a fish. It sounds sort of like  tweeeeeet.  Like that. This is a calf in captivity making an imitation of that trainer's whistle. If you hummed this tune to your dog or cat and it hummed it back to you  you ought to be pretty surprised. Very few nonhuman mammals can imitate sounds. It's really important for our music and our language. So it's a puzzle  The few other mammal groups that do this  why do they do it  A lot of my career has been devoted to trying to understand how these animals use their learning  use the ability to change what you say based on what you hear in their own communication systems. So let's start with calls of a nonhuman primate. Many mammals have to produce contact calls when  say  a mother and calf are apart. This is an example of a call produced by squirrel monkeys when they're isolated from another one. And you can see  there's not much variability in these calls. By contrast  the signature whistle which dolphins use to stay in touch  each individual here has a radically different call. They can use this ability to learn calls in order to develop more complicated and more distinctive calls to identify individuals. How about the setting in which animals need to use this call  Well let's look at mothers and calves. In normal life for mother and calf dolphin  they'll often drift apart or swim apart if Mom is chasing a fish  and when they separate they have to get back together again. What this figure shows is the percentage of the separations in which dolphins whistle  against the maximum distance. So when dolphins are separating by less than    meters  less than half the time they need to use whistles. Most of the time they can just find each other just by swimming around. But all of the time when they separate by more than     meters  they need to use these individually distinctive whistles to come back together again. Most of these distinctive signature whistles are quite stereotyped and stable through the life of a dolphin. But there are some exceptions. When a male dolphin leaves Mom  it will often join up with another male and form an alliance  which may last for decades. As these two animals form a social bond  their distinctive whistles actually converge and become very similar. This plot shows two members of a pair. As you can see at the top here  they share an up sweep  like  woop  woop  woop.  They both have that kind of up sweep. Whereas these members of a pair go  wo ot  wo ot  wo ot.  And what's happened is they've used this learning process to develop a new sign that identifies this new social group. It's a very interesting way that they can form a new identifier for the new social group that they've had. Let's now take a step back and see what this message can tell us about protecting dolphins from human disturbance. Anybody looking at this picture will know this dolphin is surrounded  and clearly his behavior is being disrupted. This is a bad situation. But it turns out that when just a single boat is approaching a group of dolphins at a couple hundred meters away  the dolphins will start whistling  they'll change what they're doing  they'll have a more cohesive group  wait for the boat to go by  and then they'll get back to normal business. Well  in a place like Sarasota  Florida  the average interval between times that a boat is passing within a hundred meters of a dolphin group is six minutes. So even in the situation that doesn't look as bad as this  it's still affecting the amount of time these animals have to do their normal work. And if we look at a very pristine environment like western Australia  Lars Bider has done work comparing dolphin behavior and distribution before there were dolphin watching boats. When there was one boat  not much of an impact. And two boats  When the second boat was added  what happened was that some of the dolphins left the area completely. Of the ones that stayed  their reproductive rate declined. So it could have a negative impact on the whole population. When we think of marine protected areas for animals like dolphins  this means that we have to be quite conscious about activities that we thought were benign. We may need to regulate the intensity of recreational boating and actual whale watching in order to prevent these kinds of problems. I'd also like to point out that sound doesn't obey boundaries. So you can draw a line to try to protect an area  but chemical pollution and noise pollution will continue to move through the area. And I'd like to switch now from this local  familiar  coastal environment to a much broader world of the baleen whales and the open ocean. This is a kind of map we've all been looking at. The world is mostly blue. But I'd also like to point out that the oceans are much more connected than we think. Notice how few barriers there are to movement across all of the oceans compared to land. To me  the most mind bending example of the interconnectedness of the ocean comes from an acoustic experiment where oceanographers took a ship to the southern Indian Ocean  deployed an underwater loudspeaker and played back a sound. That same sound traveled to the west  and could be heard in Bermuda  and traveled to the east  and could be heard in Monterey    the same sound. So we live in a world of satellite communication  are used to global communication  but it's still amazing to me. The ocean has properties that allow low frequency sound to basically move globally. The acoustic transit time for each of these paths is about three hours. It's nearly halfway around the globe. In the early '  s  Roger Payne and an ocean acoustician published a theoretical paper pointing out that it was possible that sound could transmit over these large areas  but very few biologists believed it. It actually turns out  though  even though we've only known of long range propagation for a few decades  the whales clearly have evolved  over tens of millions of years  a way to exploit this amazing property of the ocean. So blue whales and fin whales produce very low frequency sounds that can travel over very long ranges. The top plot here shows a complicated series of calls that are repeated by males. They form songs  and they appear to play a role in reproduction  sort of like that of song birds. Down below here  we see calls made by both males and females that also carry over very long ranges. The biologists continued to be skeptical of the long range communication issue well past the '  s  until the end of the Cold War. What happened was  during the Cold War  the U.S. Navy had a system that was secret at the time  that they used to track Russian submarines. It had deep underwater microphones  or hydrophones  cabled to shore  all wired back to a central place that could listen to sounds over the whole North Atlantic. And after the Berlin Wall fell  the Navy made these systems available to whale bio acousticians to see what they could hear. This is a plot from Christopher Clark who tracked one individual blue whale as it passed by Bermuda  went down to the latitude of Miami and came back again. It was tracked for    days  swimming       kilometers  or more than       miles. This shows us both that the calls are detectable over hundreds of miles and that whales routinely swim hundreds of miles. They're ocean based and scale animals who are communicating over much longer ranges than we had anticipated. Unlike fins and blues  which disperse into the temperate and tropical oceans  the humpbacked whales congregate in local traditional breeding grounds  so they can make a sound that's a little higher in frequency  broader band and more complicated. So you're listening to the complicated song produced by humpbacks here. Humpbacks  when they develop the ability to sing this song  they're listening to other whales and modifying what they sing based on what they're hearing  just like song birds or the dolphin whistles I described. This means that humpback song is a form of animal culture  just like music for humans would be. I think one of the most interesting examples of this comes from Australia. Biologists on the east coast of Australia were recording the songs of humpbacks in that area. And this orange line here marks the typical songs of east coast humpbacks. In '   they all sang the normal song. But in '   they heard a few weird songs  and it turned out that these strange songs were typical of west coast whales. The west coast calls became more and more popular  until by       none of the whales sang the east coast song  it was completely gone. They just sang the cool new west coast song. It's as if some new hit style had completely wiped out the old fashioned style before  and with no golden oldies stations. Nobody sang the old ones. I'd like to briefly just show what the ocean does to these calls. Now you are listening to a recording made by Chris Clark   .  miles away from a humpback. You can hear the full frequency range. It's quite loud. You sound very nearby. The next recording you're going to hear was made of the same humpback song    miles away. That's shown down here. You only hear the low frequencies. You hear the reverberation as the sound travels over long range in the ocean and is not quite as loud. Now after I play back these humpback calls  I'll play blue whale calls  but they have to be sped up because they're so low in frequency that you wouldn't be able to hear it otherwise. Here's a blue whale call at    miles  which was distant for the humpback. It's loud  clear    you can hear it very clearly. Here's the same call recorded from a hydrophone     miles away. There's a lot of noise  which is mostly other whales. But you can still hear that faint call. Let's now switch and think about a potential for human impacts. The most dominant sound that humans put into the ocean comes from shipping. This is the sound of a ship  and I'm having to talk a little louder to talk over it. Imagine that whale listening from     miles. There's a potential problem that maybe this kind of shipping noise would prevent whales from being able to hear each other. Now this is something that's been known for quite a while. This is a figure from a textbook on underwater sound. And on the y axis is the loudness of average ambient noise in the deep ocean by frequency. In the low frequencies  this line indicates sound that comes from seismic activity of the earth. Up high  these variable lines indicate increasing noise in this frequency range from higher wind and wave. But right in the middle here where there's a sweet spot  the noise is dominated by human ships. Now think about it. This is an amazing thing  That in this frequency range where whales communicate  the main source globally  on our planet  for the noise comes from human ships  thousands of human ships  distant  far away  just all aggregating. The next slide will show what the impact this may have on the range at which whales can communicate. So here we have the loudness of a call at the whale. And as we get farther away  the sound gets fainter and fainter. Now in the pre industrial ocean  as we were mentioning  this whale call could be easily detected. It's louder than noise at a range of a thousand kilometers. Let's now take that additional increase in noise that we saw comes from shipping. All of a sudden  the effective range of communication goes from a thousand kilometers to    kilometers. Now if this signal is used for males and females to find each other for mating and they're dispersed  imagine the impact this could have on the recovery of endangered populations. Whales also have contact calls like I described for the dolphins. I'll play the sound of a contact call used by right whales to stay in touch. And this is the kind of call that is used by  say  right whale mothers and calves as they separate to come back again. Now imagine    let's put the ship noise in the picture. What's a mother to do if the ship comes by and her calf isn't there  I'll describe a couple strategies. One strategy is if your call's down here  and the noise is in this band  you could shift the frequency of your call out of the noise band and communicate better. Susan Parks of Penn State has actually studied this. She's looked in the Atlantic. Here's data from the South Atlantic. Here's a typical South Atlantic contact call from the '  s. Look what happened by      to the average call. Same thing in the North Atlantic  in the '  s versus     . Over the last    years  as we've put more noise into the oceans  these whales have had to shift. It's as if the whole population had to shift from being basses to singing as a tenor. It's an amazing shift  induced by humans over this large scale  in both time and space. And we now know that whales can compensate for noise by calling louder  like I did when that ship was playing  by waiting for silence and by shifting their call out of the noise band. Now there's probably costs to calling louder or shifting the frequency away from where you want to be  and there's probably lost opportunities. If we also have to wait for silence  they may miss a critical opportunity to communicate. So we have to be very concerned about when the noise in habitats degrades the habitat enough that the animals either have to pay too much to be able to communicate  or are not able to perform critical functions. It's a really important problem. And I'm happy to say that there are several very promising developments in this area  looking at the impact of shipping on whales. In terms of the shipping noise  the International Maritime Organization of the United Nations has formed a group whose job is to establish guidelines for quieting ships  to tell the industry how you could quiet ships. And they've already found that by being more intelligent about better propeller design  you can reduce that noise by    percent. If you actually insulate and isolate the machinery of the ship from the hull  you can reduce that noise by    percent. So at this point  it's primarily an issue of cost and standards. If this group can establish standards  and if the shipbuilding industry adopts them for building new ships  we can now see a gradual decline in this potential problem. But there's also another problem from ships that I'm illustrating here  and that's the problem of collision. This is a whale that just squeaked by a rapidly moving container ship and avoided collision. But collision is a serious problem. Endangered whales are killed every year by ship collision  and it's very important to try to reduce this. I'll discuss two very promising approaches. The first case comes from the Bay of Fundy. These black lines mark shipping lanes in and out of the Bay of Fundy. The colorized area shows the risk of collision for endangered right whales because of the ships moving in this lane. It turns out that this lane here goes right through a major feeding area of right whales in the summer time  and it makes an area of a significant risk of collision. Well  biologists who couldn't take no for an answer went to the International Maritime Organization and petitioned them to say   Can't you move that lane  Those are just lines on the ground. Can't you move them over to a place where there's less of a risk   And the International Maritime Organization responded very strongly   These are the new lanes.  The shipping lanes have been moved. And as you can see  the risk of collision is much lower. So it's very promising  actually. We can be very creative about thinking of different ways to reduce these risks. Another action which was just taken independently by a shipping company itself was initiated because of concerns the shipping company had about greenhouse gas emissions with global warming. The Maersk Line looked at their competition and saw that everybody who is in shipping thinks time is money. They rush as fast as they can to get to their port. But then they often wait there. What Maersk did is they worked ways to slow down. They could slow down by about    percent. This reduced their fuel consumption by about    percent  which saved them money  and at the same time  it had a significant benefit for whales. It you slow down  you reduce the amount of noise you make and you reduce the risk of collision. So to conclude  I'd just like to point out  you know  the whales live in an amazing acoustic environment. They've evolved over tens of millions of years to take advantage of this. And we need to be very attentive and vigilant to thinking about where things that we do may unintentionally prevent them from being able to achieve their important activities. At the same time  we need to be really creative in thinking of solutions to be able to help reduce these problems. I hope these examples have shown some of the different directions we can take in addition to protected areas to be able to keep the ocean safe for whales to be able to continue to communicate. Thank you very much. I would be willing to bet that I'm the dumbest guy in the room because I couldn't get through school. I struggled with school. But what I knew at a very early age was that I loved money and I loved business and I loved this entrepreneurial thing  and I was raised to be an entrepreneur  and what I've been really passionate about ever since    and I've never spoken about this ever  until now    so this is the first time anyone's ever heard it  except my wife three days ago  because she said   What are you talking about   and I told her    is that I think we miss an opportunity to find these kids who have the entrepreneurial traits  and to groom them or show them that being an entrepreneur is actually a cool thing. It's not something that is a bad thing and is vilified  which is what happens in a lot of society. Kids  when we grow up  have dreams  and we have passions  and we have visions  and somehow we get those things crushed. We get told that we need to study harder or be more focused or get a tutor. My parents got me a tutor in French  and I still suck in French. Two years ago  I was the highest rated lecturer at MIT's entrepreneurial master's program. And it was a speaking event in front of groups of entrepreneurs from around the world. When I was in grade two  I won a city wide speaking competition  but nobody had ever said   Hey  this kid's a good speaker. He can't focus  but he loves walking around and getting people energized.  No one said   Get him a coach in speaking.  They said  get me a tutor in what I suck at. So as kids show these traits    and we need to start looking for them    I think we should be raising kids to be entrepreneurs instead of lawyers. Unfortunately the school system is grooming this world to say   Hey  let's be a lawyer or let's be a doctor   and we're missing that opportunity because no one ever says   Hey  be an entrepreneur.  Entrepreneurs are people    because we have a lot of them in this room    who have these ideas and these passions or see these needs in the world and we decide to stand up and do it. And we put everything on the line to make that stuff happen. We have the ability to get those groups of people around us that want to kind of build that dream with us  and I think if we could get kids to embrace the idea at a young age of being entrepreneurial  we could change everything in the world that is a problem today. Every problem that's out there  somebody has the idea for. And as a young kid  nobody can say it can't happen because you're too dumb to realize that you couldn't figure it out. I think we have an obligation as parents and a society to start teaching our kids to fish instead of giving them the fish    the old parable   If you give a man a fish  you feed him for a day. If you teach a man to fish  you feed him for a lifetime.  If we can teach our kids to become entrepreneurial    the ones that show those traits to be    like we teach the ones who have science gifts to go on in science  what if we saw the ones who had entrepreneurial traits and taught them to be entrepreneurs  We could actually have all these kids spreading businesses instead of waiting for government handouts. What we do is we sit and teach our kids all the things they shouldn't do  Don't hit  don't bite  don't swear. Right now we teach our kids to go after really good jobs  you know  and the school system teaches them to go after things like being a doctor and being a lawyer and being an accountant and a dentist and a teacher and a pilot. And the media says that it's really cool if we could go out and be a model or a singer or a sports hero like Luongo  Crosby. Our MBA programs do not teach kids to be entrepreneurs. The reason that I avoided an MBA program    other than the fact that I couldn't get into any because I had a    percent average out of high school and then    percent average at the only school in Canada that accepted me  Carlton    but our MBA programs don't teach kids to be entrepreneurs. They teach them to go work in corporations. So who's starting these companies  It's these random few people. Even in popular literature  the only book I've ever found    and this should be on all of your reading lists    the only book I've ever found that makes the entrepreneur into the hero is  Atlas Shrugged.  Everything else in the world tends to look at entrepreneurs and say that we're bad people. I look at even my family. Both my grandfathers were entrepreneurs. My dad was an entrepreneur. Both my brother and sister and I  all three of us own companies as well. And we all decided to start these things because it's really the only place we fit. We didn't fit in the normal work. We couldn't work for somebody else because we're too stubborn and we have all these other traits. But kids could be entrepreneurs as well. I'm a big part of a couple organizations globally called the Entrepreneurs' Organization and the Young Presidents' Organization. I just came back from speaking in Barcelona at the YPO global conference  and everyone that I met over there who's an entrepreneur struggled with school. I have    out of the    signs of attention deficit disorder diagnosed. So this thing right here is freaking me out. It's probably why I'm a little bit panicked right now    other than all the caffeine that I've had and the sugar    but this is really creepy for an entrepreneur. Attention deficit disorder  bipolar disorder. Do you know that bipolar disorder is nicknamed the CEO disease  Ted Turner's got it. Steve Jobs has it. All three of the founders of Netscape had it. I could go on and on. Kids    you can see these signs in kids. And what we're doing is we're giving them Ritalin and saying   Don't be an entrepreneurial type. Fit into this other system and try to become a student.  Sorry  entrepreneurs aren't students. We fast track. We figure out the game. I stole essays. I cheated on exams. I hired kids to do my accounting assignments in university for    consecutive assignments. But as an entrepreneur you don't do accounting  you hire accountants. So I just figured that out earlier. At least I can admit I cheated in university  most of you won't. I'm also quoted    and I told the person who wrote the textbook    I'm now quoted in that exact same university textbook in every Canadian university and college studies. In managerial accounting  I'm chapter eight. I open up chapter eight talking about budgeting. And I told the author  after they did my interview  that I cheated in that same course. And she thought it was too funny to not include it anyway. But kids  you can see these signs in them. The definition of an entrepreneur is  a person who organizes  operates and assumes the risk of a business venture.  That doesn't mean you have to go to an MBA program. It doesn't mean you have to get through school. It just means that those few things have to feel right in your gut. And we've heard those things about  is it nurture or is it nature   right  Is it thing one or thing two  What is it  Well  I don't think it's either. I think it can be both. I was groomed as an entrepreneur. When I was growing up as a young kid  I had no choice  because I was taught at a very early  young age    when my dad realized I wasn't going to fit into everything else that was being taught to me in school    that he could teach me to figure out business at an early age. He groomed us  the three of us  to hate the thought of having a job and to love the fact of creating companies that we could employ other people. My first little business venture  I was seven years old  I was in Winnipeg  and I was lying in my bedroom with one of those long extension cords. And I was calling all the dry cleaners in Winnipeg to find out how much would the dry cleaners pay me for coat hangers. And my mom came into the room and she said   Where are you going to get the coat hangers to sell to the dry cleaners   And I said   Let's go and look in the basement.  And we went down to the basement. And I opened up this cupboard. And there was about a thousand coat hangers that I'd collected. Because  when I told her I was going out to play with the kids  I was going door to door in the neighborhood to collect coat hangers to put in the basement to sell. Because I saw her a few weeks before that    you could get paid. They used to pay you two cents per coat hanger. So I was just like  well there's all kinds of coat hangers. And so I'll just go get them. And I knew she wouldn't want me to go get them  so I just did it anyway. And I learned that you could actually negotiate with people. This one person offered me three cents and I got him up to three and a half. I even knew at a seven year old age that I could actually get a fractional percent of a cent  and people would pay that because it multiplied up. At seven years old I figured it out. I got three and a half cents for a thousand coat hangers. I sold license plate protectors door to door. My dad actually made me go find someone who would sell me these things at wholesale. And at nine years old  I walked around in the city of Sudbury selling license plate protectors door to door to houses. And I remember this one customer so vividly because I also did some other stuff with these clients. I sold newspapers. And he wouldn't buy a newspaper from me ever. But I was convinced I was going to get him to buy a license plate protector. And he's like   Well  we don't need one.  And I said   But you've got two cars ...     I'm nine years old. I'm like   But you have two cars and they don't have license plate protectors.  And he said   I know.  And I said   This car here's got one license plate that's all crumpled up.  And he said   Yes  that's my wife's car.  And I said   Why don't we just test one on the front of your wife's car and see if it lasts longer.  So I knew there were two cars with two license plates on each. If I couldn't sell all four  I could at least get one. I learned that at a young age. I did comic book arbitrage. When I was about    years old  I sold comic books out of our cottage on Georgian Bay. And I would go biking up to the end of the beach and buy all the comics from the poor kids. And then I would go back to the other end of the beach and sell them to the rich kids. But it was obvious to me  right  Buy low  sell high. You've got this demand over here that has money. Don't try to sell to the poor kids  they don't have cash. The rich people do. Go get some. So that's obvious  right. It's like a recession. So  there's a recession. There's still    trillion dollars circulating in the U.S. economy. Go get some of that. And I learned that at a young age. I also learned  don't reveal your source  because I got beat up after about four weeks of doing this because one of the rich kids found out where I was buying my comics from  and he didn't like the fact that he was paying a lot more. I was forced to get a paper route at    years old. I didn't really want a paper route  but at     my dad said   That's going to be your next business.  So not only would he get me one  but I had to get two  and then he wanted me to hire someone to deliver half the papers  which I did  and then I realized that collecting tips was where you made all the money. So I would collect the tips and get payment. So I would go and collect for all the papers. He could just deliver them. Because then I realized I could make the money. By this point  I was definitely not going to be an employee. My dad owned an automotive and industrial repair shop. He had all these old automotive parts lying around. They had this old brass and copper. I asked him what he did with it  and he said he just throws it out. I said   But wouldn't somebody pay you for that   And he goes   Maybe.  Remember at    years old    so    years ago I saw opportunity in this stuff. I saw there was money in garbage. And I was actually collecting it from all the automotive shops in the area on my bicycle. And then my dad would drive me on Saturdays to a scrap metal recycler where I got paid. And I thought that was kind of cool. Strangely enough     years later  we're building       GOT JUNK  and making money off that too. I built these little pincushions when I was    years old in Cubs  and we made these pin cushions for our moms for Mother's Day. And you made these pincushions out of wooden clothespins    when we used to hang clothes on clotheslines outside. And you'd make these chairs. And I had these little pillows that I would sew up. And you could stuff pins in them. Because people used to sew and they needed a pin cushion. But what I realized was that you had to have options. So I actually spray painted a whole bunch of them brown. And then when I went to the door  it wasn't   Do you want to buy one   It was   Which color would you like   Like I'm    years old  you're not going to say no to me  especially if you have two options    you have the brown one or the clear one. So I learned that lesson at a young age. I learned that manual labor really sucks. Right  like cutting lawns is brutal. But because I had to cut lawns all summer for all of our neighbors and get paid to do that  I realized that recurring revenue from one client is amazing. That if I land this client once  and every week I get paid by that person  that's way better than trying to sell one clothespin thing to one person. Because you can't sell them more. So I love that recurring revenue model I started to learn at a young age. Remember  I was being groomed to do this. I was not allowed to have jobs. I would caddy  I would go to the golf course and caddy for people. But I realized that there was this one hill on our golf course  the   th hole that had this huge hill. And people could never get their bags up it. So I would sit there with a lawn chair and just carry up all the people who didn't have caddies. I would carry their golf bags up to the top  and they'd pay me a dollar. Meanwhile  my friends were working for five hours to haul some guy's bag around and get paid    bucks. I'm like   That's stupid because you have to work for five hours. That doesn't make any sense.  You just figure out a way to make more money faster. Every week  I would go to the corner store and buy all these pops. Then I would go up and deliver them to these    year old women playing bridge. And they'd give me their orders for the following week. And then I'd just deliver pop and I'd just charge twice. And I had this captured market. You didn't need contracts. You just needed to have a supply and demand and this audience who bought into you. These women weren't going to go to anybody else because they liked me  and I kind of figured it out. I went and got golf balls from golf courses. But everybody else was looking in the bush and looking in the ditches for golf balls. I'm like  screw that. They're all in the pond and nobody's going into the pond. So I would go into the ponds and crawl around and pick them up with my toes. You just pick them up with both feet. You can't do it on stage. You get the golf balls  and you just throw them in your bathing suit trunks and when you're done you've got a couple hundred of them. But the problem is that people all didn't want all the golf balls. So I just packaged them. I'm like     right  I packaged them up three ways. I had the Pinnacles and DDHs and the really cool ones back then. Those sold for two dollars each. And then I had all the good ones that didn't look crappy. They were    cents each. And then I'd sell    at a time of all the crappy ones. And they could use those for practice balls. I sold sunglasses  when I was in school  to all the kids in high school. This is what really kind of gets everybody hating you is because you're trying to extract money from all your friends all the time. But it paid the bills. So I sold lots and lots of sunglasses. Then when the school shut me down    the school actually called me into the office and told me I couldn't do it    so I went to the gas stations and I sold lots of them to the gas stations and had the gas stations sell them to their customers. That was cool because then I had retail outlets. And I think I was   . Then I paid my entire way through first year university at Carlton by selling wine skins door to door. You know that you can hold a    ounce bottle of rum and two bottles of coke in a wineskin  So what  right  Yeah  but you know what  You stuff that down your shorts  when you go into a football game you can get booze in for free  everybody bought them. Supply  demand  big opportunity. I also branded it  so I sold them for five times the normal cost. It had our university logo on it. You know we teach our kids and we buy them games  but why don't we get them games  if they're entrepreneurial kids  that kind of nurture the traits that you need to be entrepreneurs  Why don't you teach them not to waste money  I remember being told to walk out in the middle of a street in Banff  Alberta because I'd thrown a penny out in the street  and my dad said   Go pick it up.  He said   I work too damn hard for my money. I'm not going to see you ever waste a penny.  And I remember that lesson to this day. Allowances teach kids the wrong habits. Allowances  by nature  are teaching kids to think about a job. An entrepreneur doesn't expect a regular paycheck. Allowance is breeding kids at a young age to expect a regular paycheck. That's wrong  for me  if you want to raise entrepreneurs. What I do with my kids now    I've got two  nine and seven    is I teach them to walk around the house and the yard  looking for stuff that needs to get done. Come to me and tell me what it is. Or I'll come to them and say   Here's what I need done.  And then you know what we do  We negotiate. They go around looking for what it is. But then we negotiate on what they're going to get paid. And then they don't have a regular check  but they have more opportunities to find more stuff  and they learn the skill of negotiating  and they learn the skill of finding opportunities as well. You breed that kind of stuff. Each of my kids has two piggy banks. Fifty percent of all the money that they earn or get gifted     percent goes in their house account     percent goes in their toy account. Anything in their toy account they can spend on whatever they want. The    percent that goes in their house account  every six months  goes to the bank. They walk up with me. Every year all the money in the bank goes to their broker. Both my nine  and seven year olds have a stock broker already. But I'm teaching them to force that savings habit. It drives me crazy that    year olds are saying   Maybe I'll start contributing to my RSP now.  Shit  you've missed    years. You can teach those habits to young kids when they don't even feel the pain yet. Don't read them bedtime stories every night. Maybe four nights out of the week read them bedtime stories and three nights of the week have them tell stories. Why don't you sit down with kids and give them four items  a red shirt  a blue tie  a kangaroo and a laptop  and have them tell a story about those four things  My kids do that all the time. It teaches them to sell  it teaches them creativity  it teaches them to think on their feet. Just do that kind of stuff and have fun with it. Get kids to stand up in front of groups and talk  even if it's just stand up in front of their friends and do plays and have speeches. Those are entrepreneurial traits that you want to be nurturing. Show the kids what bad customers or bad employees look like. Show them the grumpy employees. When you see grumpy customer service  point that out to them. Say   By the way  that guy's a crappy employee.  And say   These ones are good ones.  If you go into a restaurant and you have bad customer service  show them what bad customer service looks like. We have all these lessons in front of us  but we don't take those opportunities  we teach kids to go get a tutor. Imagine if you actually took all the kids' junk that's in the house right now  all the toys that they've outgrown two years ago and said   Why don't we start selling some of this on Craigslist and Kijiji   And they can actually sell it and learn how to find scammers when they get email offers come in. They can come into your account or a sub account or whatever. But teach them how to fix the price  guess the price  pull up the photos. Teach them how to do that kind of stuff and make money. Then the money they get     percent goes in their house account     percent goes in their toy account. My kids love this stuff. Some of the entrepreneurial traits that you've got to nurture in kids  attainment  tenacity  leadership  introspection  interdependence  values. All these traits you can find in young kids  and you can help nurture them. Look for that kind of stuff. There's two traits that I want you to also look out for that we don't kind of get out of their system. Don't medicate kids for attention deficit disorder unless it is really  really freaking bad. The same with the whole things on mania and stress and depression  unless it is so clinically brutal  man. Bipolar disorder is nicknamed the CEO disease. When Steve Jurvetson and Jim Clark and Jim Barksdale have all got it  and they built Netscape    imagine if they were given Ritalin. We wouldn't have have that stuff  right  Al Gore really would have had to invented the Internet. These skills are the skills we should be teaching in the classroom as well as everything else. I'm not saying don't get kids to want to be lawyers. But how about getting entrepreneurship to be ranked right up there with the rest of them as well  Because there's huge opportunities in that. I want to close with a quick little video. It's a video that was done by one of the companies that I mentor. These guys  Grasshopper. It's about kids. It's about entrepreneurship. Hopefully this inspires you to take what you've heard from me and do something with it to change the world.  Kid ...  And you thought you could do anything     You still can.   Because a lot of what we consider impossible ...   ... is easy to overcome   Because in case you haven't noticed  we live in a place where   One individual can make a difference   Want proof    Just look at the people who built our country    Our parents  grandparents  our aunts  uncles ...   They were immigrants  newcomers ready to make their mark   Maybe they came with very little   Or perhaps they didn't own anything except for ...   ... a single brilliant idea   These people were thinkers  doers ...   ... innovators ...   ... until they came up with the name ...   ... entrepreneurs    They change the way we think about what is possible.   They have a clear vision of how life can be better   for all of us  even when times are tough.   Right now  it's hard to see ...   ... when our view is cluttered with obstacles.   But turbulence creates opportunities   for success  achievement  and pushes us ...   to discover new ways of doing things   So what opportunities will you go after and why    If you're an entrepreneur   you know that risk isn't the reward.   No. The rewards are driving innovation ...   ... changing people's lives. Creating jobs.   Fueling growth.   And making a better world.   Entrepreneurs are everywhere.   They run small businesses that support our economy    design tools to help you ...   ... stay connected with friends  family and colleagues around the world.   And they're finding new ways of helping to solve society's oldest problems.   Do you know an entrepreneur    Entrepreneurs can be anyone ...   Even ... you    So seize the opportunity to create the job you always wanted   Help heal the economy   Make a difference.   Take your business to new heights.   But most importantly    remember when you were a kid ...   when everything was within you reach    and then say to yourself quietly  but with determination     It still is.   Thank you very much for having me.  Sanskrit  This is an ode to the mother goddess  that most of us in India learn when we are children. I learned it when I was four at my mother's knee. That year she introduced me to dance  and thus began my tryst with classical dance. Since then    it's been four decades now    I've trained with the best in the field  performed across the globe  taught young and old alike  created  collaborated  choreographed  and wove a rich tapestry of artistry  achievement and awards. The crowning glory was in       when I received this country's fourth highest civilian award  the Padma Shri  for my contribution to art. But nothing  nothing prepared me for what I was to hear on the first of July     . I heard the word  carcinoma.  Yes  breast cancer. As I sat dumbstruck in my doctor's office  I heard other words   cancer    stage    grade.  Until then  Cancer was the zodiac sign of my friend  stage was what I performed on  and grades were what I got in school. That day  I realized I had an unwelcome  uninvited  new life partner. As a dancer  I know the nine rasas or the navarasas  anger  valor  disgust  humor and fear. I thought I knew what fear was. That day  I learned what fear was. Overcome with the enormity of it all and the complete feeling of loss of control  I shed copious tears and asked my dear husband  Jayant. I said   Is this it  Is this the end of the road  Is this the end of my dance   And he  the positive soul that he is  said   No  this is just a hiatus  a hiatus during the treatment  and you'll get back to doing what you do best.  I realized then that I  who thought I had complete control of my life  had control of only three things  My thought  my mind    the images that these thoughts created    and the action that derived from it. So here I was wallowing in a vortex of emotions and depression and what have you  with the enormity of the situation  wanting to go to a place of healing  health and happiness. I wanted to go from where I was to where I wanted to be  for which I needed something. I needed something that would pull me out of all this. So I dried my tears  and I declared to the world at large ... I said   Cancer's only one page in my life  and I will not allow this page to impact the rest of my life.  I also declared to the world at large that I would ride it out  and I would not allow cancer to ride me. But to go from where I was to where I wanted to be  I needed something. I needed an anchor  an image  a peg to peg this process on  so that I could go from there. And I found that in my dance  my dance  my strength  my energy  my passion  my very life breath. But it wasn't easy. Believe me  it definitely wasn't easy. How do you keep cheer when you go from beautiful to bald in three days  How do you not despair when  with the body ravaged by chemotherapy  climbing a mere flight of stairs was sheer torture  that to someone like me who could dance for three hours  How do you not get overwhelmed by the despair and the misery of it all  All I wanted to do was curl up and weep. But I kept telling myself fear and tears are options I did not have. So I would drag myself into my dance studio    body  mind and spirit    every day into my dance studio  and learn everything I learned when I was four  all over again  reworked  relearned  regrouped. It was excruciatingly painful  but I did it. Difficult. I focused on my mudras  on the imagery of my dance  on the poetry and the metaphor and the philosophy of the dance itself. And slowly  I moved out of that miserable state of mind. But I needed something else. I needed something to go that extra mile  and I found it in that metaphor which I had learned from my mother when I was four. The metaphor of Mahishasura Mardhini  of Durga. Durga  the mother goddess  the fearless one  created by the pantheon of Hindu gods. Durga  resplendent  bedecked  beautiful  her    arms ready for warfare  as she rode astride her lion into the battlefield to destroy Mahishasur. Durga  the epitome of creative feminine energy  or shakti. Durga  the fearless one. I made that image of Durga and her every attribute  her every nuance  my very own. Powered by the symbology of a myth and the passion of my training  I brought laser sharp focus into my dance  laser sharp focus to such an extent that I danced a few weeks after surgery. I danced through chemo and radiation cycles  much to the dismay of my oncologist. I danced between chemo and radiation cycles and badgered him to fit it to my performing dance schedule. What I had done is I had tuned out of cancer and tuned into my dance. Yes  cancer has just been one page in my life. My story is a story of overcoming setbacks  obstacles and challenges that life throws at you. My story is the power of thought. My story is the power of choice. It's the power of focus. It's the power of bringing ourselves to the attention of something that so animates you  so moves you  that something even like cancer becomes insignificant. My story is the power of a metaphor. It's the power of an image. Mine was that of Durga  Durga the fearless one. She was also called Simhanandini  the one who rode the lion. As I ride out  as I ride my own inner strength  my own inner resilience  armed as I am with what medication can provide and continue treatment  as I ride out into the battlefield of cancer  asking my rogue cells to behave  I want to be known not as a cancer survivor  but as a cancer conqueror. I present to you an excerpt of that work  Simhanandini.  I'm going to talk about the simple truth in leadership in the   st century. In the   st century  we need to actually look at    and what I'm actually going to encourage you to consider today    is to go back to our school days when we learned how to count. But I think it's time for us to think about what we count. Because what we actually count truly counts. Let me start by telling you a little story. This is Van Quach. She came to this country in      from Vietnam. She changed her name to Vivian because she wanted to fit in here in America. Her first job was at an inner city motel in San Francisco as a maid. I happened to buy that motel about three months after Vivian started working there. So Vivian and I have been working together for    years. With the youthful idealism of a    year old  in       I started my company and I called it Joie de Vivre  a very impractical name  because I actually was looking to create joy of life. And this first hotel that I bought  motel  was a pay by the hour  no tell motel in the inner city of San Francisco. As I spent time with Vivian  I saw that she had sort of a joie de vivre in how she did her work. It made me question and curious  How could someone actually find joy in cleaning toilets for a living  So I spent time with Vivian  and I saw that she didn't find joy in cleaning toilets. Her job  her goal and her calling was not to become the world's greatest toilet scrubber. What counts for Vivian was the emotional connection she created with her fellow employees and our guests. And what gave her inspiration and meaning was the fact that she was taking care of people who were far away from home. Because Vivian knew what it was like to be far away from home. That very human lesson  more than    years ago  served me well during the last economic downturn we had. In the wake of the dotcom crash and       San Francisco Bay Area hotels went through the largest percentage revenue drop in the history of American hotels. We were the largest operator of hotels in the Bay Area  so we were particularly vulnerable. But also back then  remember we stopped eating French fries in this country. Well  not exactly  of course not. We started eating  freedom fries   and we started boycotting anything that was French. Well  my name of my company  Joie de Vivre    so I started getting these letters from places like Alabama and Orange County saying to me that they were going to boycott my company because they thought we were a French company. And I'd write them back  and I'd say   What a minute. We're not French. We're an American company. We're based in San Francisco.  And I'd get a terse response   Oh  that's worse.  So one particular day when I was feeling a little depressed and not a lot of joie de vivre  I ended up in the local bookstore around the corner from our offices. And I initially ended up in the business section of the bookstore looking for a business solution. But given my befuddled state of mind  I ended up in the self help section very quickly. That's where I got reacquainted with Abraham Maslow's  hierarchy of needs.  I took one psychology class in college  and I learned about this guy  Abraham Maslow  as many of us are familiar with his hierarchy of needs. But as I sat there for four hours  the full afternoon  reading Maslow  I recognized something that is true of most leaders. One of the simplest facts in business is something that we often neglect  and that is that we're all human. Each of us  no matter what our role is in business  has some hierarchy of needs in the workplace. So as I started reading more Maslow  what I started to realize is that Maslow  later in his life  wanted to take this hierarchy for the individual and apply it to the collective  to organizations and specifically to business. But unfortunately  he died prematurely in       and so he wasn't really able to live that dream completely. So I realized in that dotcom crash that my role in life was to channel Abe Maslow. And that's what I did a few years ago when I took that five level hierarchy of needs pyramid and turned it into what I call the transformation pyramid  which is survival  success and transformation. It's not just fundamental in business  it's fundamental in life. And we started asking ourselves the questions about how we were actually addressing the higher needs  these transformational needs for our key employees in the company. These three levels of the hierarchy needs relate to the five levels of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. But as we started asking ourselves about how we were addressing the higher needs of our employees and our customers  I realized we had no metrics. We had nothing that actually could tell us whether we were actually getting it right. So we started asking ourselves  What kind of less obvious metrics could we use to actually evaluate our employees' sense of meaning  or our customers' sense of emotional connection with us  For example  we actually started asking our employees  do they understand the mission of our company  and do they feel like they believe in it  can they actually influence it  and do they feel that their work actually has an impact on it  We started asking our customers  did they feel an emotional connection with us  in one of seven different kinds of ways. Miraculously  as we asked these questions and started giving attention higher up the pyramid  what we found is we created more loyalty. Our customer loyalty skyrocketed. Our employee turnover dropped to one third of the industry average  and during that five year dotcom bust  we tripled in size. As I went out and started spending time with other leaders out there and asking them how they were getting through that time  what they told me over and over again was that they just manage what they can measure. What we can measure is that tangible stuff at the bottom of the pyramid. They didn't even see the intangible stuff higher up the pyramid. So I started asking myself the question  How can we get leaders to start valuing the intangible  If we're taught as leaders to just manage what we can measure  and all we can measure is the tangible in life  we're missing a whole lot of things at the top of the pyramid. So I went out and studied a bunch of things  and I found a survey that showed that    percent of business leaders worldwide believe that the intangibles are important in their business  things like intellectual property  their corporate culture  their brand loyalty  and yet  only five percent of those same leaders actually had a means of measuring the intangibles in their business. So as leaders  we understand that intangibles are important  but we don't have a clue how to measure them. So here's another Einstein quote   Not everything that can be counted counts  and not everything that counts can be counted.  I hate to argue with Einstein  but if that which is most valuable in our life and our business actually can't be counted or valued  aren't we going to spend our lives just mired in measuring the mundane  It was that sort of heady question about what counts that led me to take my CEO hat off for a week and fly off to the Himalayan peaks. I flew off to a place that's been shrouded in mystery for centuries  a place some folks call Shangri La. It's actually moved from the survival base of the pyramid to becoming a transformational role model for the world. I went to Bhutan. The teenage king of Bhutan was also a curious man  but this was back in       when he ascended to the throne two days after his father passed away. At age     he started asking the kinds of questions that you'd expect of someone with a beginner's mind. On a trip through India  early in his reign as king  he was asked by an Indian journalist about the Bhutanese GDP  the size of the Bhutanese GDP. The king responded in a fashion that actually has transformed us four decades later. He said the following  he said   Why are we so obsessed and focused with gross domestic product  Why don't we care more about gross national happiness   Now  in essence  the king was asking us to consider an alternative definition of success  what has come to be known as GNH  or gross national happiness. Most world leaders didn't take notice  and those that did thought this was just  Buddhist economics.  But the king was serious. This was a notable moment  because this was the first time a world leader in almost     years had suggested that intangible of happiness    that leader     years ago  Thomas Jefferson with the Declaration of Independence        years later  this king was suggesting that intangible of happiness is something that we should measure  and it's something we should actually value as government officials. For the next three dozen years as king  this king actually started measuring and managing around happiness in Bhutan    including  just recently  taking his country from being an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy with no bloodshed  no coup. Bhutan  for those of you who don't know it  is the newest democracy in the world  just two years ago. So as I spent time with leaders in the GNH movement  I got to really understand what they're doing. And I got to spend some time with the prime minister. Over dinner  I asked him an impertinent question. I asked him   How can you create and measure something which evaporates    in other words  happiness   And he's a very wise man  and he said   Listen  Bhutan's goal is not to create happiness. We create the conditions for happiness to occur. In other words  we create a habitat of happiness.  Wow  that's interesting. He said that they have a science behind that art  and they've actually created four essential pillars  nine key indicators and    different metrics that help them to measure their GNH. One of those key indicators is  How do the Bhutanese feel about how they spend their time each day  It's a good question. How do you feel about how you spend your time each day  Time is one of the scarcest resources in the modern world. And yet  of course  that little intangible piece of data doesn't factor into our GDP calculations. As I spent my week up in the Himalayas  I started to imagine what I call an emotional equation. And it focuses on something I read long ago from a guy named Rabbi Hyman Schachtel. How many know him  Anybody        he wrote a book called  The Real Enjoyment of Living   and he suggested that happiness is not about having what you want  instead  it's about wanting what you have. Or in other words  I think the Bhutanese believe happiness equals wanting what you have    imagine gratitude    divided by having what you want    gratification. The Bhutanese aren't on some aspirational treadmill  constantly focused on what they don't have. Their religion  their isolation  their deep respect for their culture and now the principles of their GNH movement all have fostered a sense of gratitude about what they do have. How many of us here  as TEDsters in the audience  spend more of our time in the bottom half of this equation  in the denominator  We are a bottom heavy culture in more ways than one. The reality is  in Western countries  quite often we do focus on the pursuit of happiness as if happiness is something that we have to go out    an object that we're supposed to get  or maybe many objects. Actually  in fact  if you look in the dictionary  many dictionaries define pursuit as to  chase with hostility.  Do we pursue happiness with hostility  Good question. But back to Bhutan. Bhutan's bordered on its north and south by    percent of the world's population. Could this little country  like a startup in a mature industry  be the spark plug that influences a   st century of middle class in China and India  Bhutan's created the ultimate export  a new global currency of well being  and there are    countries around the world today that are studying their own GNH. You may have heard  this last fall Nicolas Sarkozy in France announcing the results of an    month study by two Nobel economists  focusing on happiness and wellness in France. Sarkozy suggested that world leaders should stop myopically focusing on GDP and consider a new index  what some French are calling a  joie de vivre index.  I like it. Co branding opportunities. Just three days ago  three days ago here at TED  we had a simulcast of David Cameron  potentially the next prime minister of the UK  quoting one of my favorite speeches of all time  Robert Kennedy's poetic speech from      when he suggested that we're myopically focused on the wrong thing and that GDP is a misplaced metric. So it suggests that the momentum is shifting. I've taken that Robert Kennedy quote  and I've turned it into a new balance sheet for just a moment here. This is a collection of things that Robert Kennedy said in that quote. GDP counts everything from air pollution to the destruction of our redwoods. But it doesn't count the health of our children or the integrity of our public officials. As you look at these two columns here  doesn't it make you feel like it's time for us to start figuring out a new way to count  a new way to imagine what's important to us in life  Certainly Robert Kennedy suggested at the end of the speech exactly that. He said GDP  measures everything in short  except that which makes life worthwhile.  Wow. So how do we do that  Let me say one thing we can just start doing ten years from now  at least in this country. Why in the heck in America are we doing a census in       We're spending    billion dollars on the census. We're asking    simple questions    it is simplicity. But all of those questions are tangible. They're about demographics. They're about where you live  how many people you live with  and whether you own your home or not. That's about it. We're not asking meaningful metrics. We're not asking important questions. We're not asking anything that's intangible. Abe Maslow said long ago something you've heard before  but you didn't realize it was him. He said   If the only tool you have is a hammer  everything starts to look like a nail.  We've been fooled by our tool. Excuse that expression. We've been fooled by our tool. GDP has been our hammer. And our nail has been a   th  and   th century industrial era model of success. And yet     percent of the world's GDP today is in that intangible industry we call service  the service industry  the industry I'm in. And only    percent is in the tangible industries of manufacturing and agriculture. So maybe it's time that we get a bigger toolbox  right  Maybe it's time we get a toolbox that doesn't just count what's easily counted  the tangible in life  but actually counts what we most value  the things that are intangible. I guess I'm sort of a curious CEO. I was also a curious economics major as an undergrad. I learned that economists measure everything in tangible units of production and consumption as if each of those tangible units is exactly the same. They aren't the same. In fact  as leaders  what we need to learn is that we can influence the quality of that unit of production by creating the conditions for our employees to live their calling. In Vivian's case  her unit of production isn't the tangible hours she works  it's the intangible difference she makes during that one hour of work. This is Dave Arringdale who's actually been a longtime guest at Vivian's motel. He stayed there a hundred times in the last    years  and he's loyal to the property because of the relationship that Vivian and her fellow employees have created with him. They've created a habitat of happiness for Dave. He tells me that he can always count on Vivian and the staff there to make him feel at home. Why is it that business leaders and investors quite often don't see the connection between creating the intangible of employee happiness with creating the tangible of financial profits in their business  We don't have to choose between inspired employees and sizable profits  we can have both. In fact  inspired employees quite often help make sizable profits  right  So what the world needs now  in my opinion  is business leaders and political leaders who know what to count. We count numbers. We count on people. What really counts is when we actually use our numbers to truly take into account our people. I learned that from a maid in a motel and a king of a country. What can you start counting today  What one thing can you start counting today that actually would be meaningful in your life  whether it's your work life or your business life  Thank you very much. I'm going to begin by reciting a poem.  Oh beloved dentist  Your rubber fingers in my mouth ... your voice so soft and muffled ... Lower the mask  dear dentist  lower the mask.  Okay  in this presentation  I'm going to be putting the right side of your brains through a fairly serious workout. You're going to see a lot of imagery  and it's not always connected to what I'm talking about  so I need you to kind of split your brains in half and let the images flow over one side and listen to me on the other. So I am one of those people with a transformative personal story. Six years ago  after    years in graphic design and typography  I changed the way I was working and the way most graphic designers work to pursue a more personal approach to my work  with only the humble attempt to simply make a living doing something that I loved. But something weird happened. I became bizarrely popular. My current work seems to resonate with people in a way that has so taken me by surprise that I still frequently wonder what in the hell is going on. And I'm slowly coming to understand that the appeal of what I do may be connected to why I do it. These days  I call myself a graphic artist. So where my work as a graphic designer was to follow strategy  my work now follows my heart and my interests with the guidance of my ego to create work that is mutually beneficial to myself and a client. Now  this is heresy in the design world. The ego is not supposed to be involved in graphic design. But I find that for myself  without exception  the more I deal with the work as something of my own  as something that is personal  the more successful it is as something that's compelling  interesting and sustaining. So I exist somewhat outside of the mainstream of design thinking. Where others might look at measurable results  I tend to be interested in more ethereal qualities  like  Does it bring joy    Is there a sense of wonder   and  Does it invoke curiosity   This is a scientific diagram  by the way. I don't have time to explain it  but it has to do with DNA and RNA. So I have a particular imaginative approach to visual work. The things that interest me when I'm working are visual structure  surprise and anything that requires figuring things out. So for this reason  I'm particularly drawn to systems and patterns. I'm going to give you a couple of examples of how my brain works. This is a piece that I did for The Guardian newspaper in the U.K. They have a magazine that they call G . And this is for their puzzle special in     . And puzzling it is. I started by creating a series of tiling units. And these tiling units  I designed specifically so that they would contain parts of letterforms within their shapes so that I could then join those pieces together to create letters and then words within the abstract patterning. But then as well  I was able to just flip them  rotate them and combine them in different ways to create either regular patterns or abstract patterns. So here's the word puzzle again. And here it is with the abstract surrounding. And as you can see  it's extremely difficult to read. But all I have to do is fill certain areas of those letterforms and I can bring those words out of the background pattern. But maybe that's a little too obvious. So then I can add some color in with the background and add a bit more color in with the words themselves  and this way  working with the art director  I'm able to bring it to just the right point that it's puzzling for the audience    they can figure out that there's something they have to read    but it's not impossible for them to read. I'm also interested in working with unusual materials and common materials in unusual ways. So this requires figuring out how to get the most out of something's innate properties and also how to bend it to my will. So ultimately  my goal is to create something unexpected. To this end  I have worked in sugar for Stefan Sagmeister  three time TED speaker. And this project began essentially on my kitchen table. I've been eating cereal for breakfast all of my life. And for that same amount of time  I've been spilling sugar on the table and just kind of playing with it with my fingers. And eventually I used this technique to create a piece of artwork. And then I used it again to create six pieces for Stefan's book   Things in My Life I've Learned So Far.  And these were created without sketches  just freehand  by putting the sugar down on a white surface and then manipulating it to get the words and designs out of it. Recently  I've also made some rather highbrow baroque borders out of lowbrow pasta. And this is for a chapter that I'm doing in a book  and the chapter is on honor. So it's a little bit unexpected  but  in a way  it refers to the macaroni art that children make for their parents or they make in school and give to their parents  which is in itself a form of honor. This is what you can do with some household tinfoil. Okay  well  it's what I can do with some household tinfoil. I'm very interested in wonder  in design as an impetus to inquiring. To say I wonder is to say I question  I ask. And to experience wonder is to experience awe. So I'm currently working on a book  which plays with both senses of the word  as I explore some of my own ideas and inquiries in a visual display of rather peacock like grandeur. The world is full of wonder. But the world of graphic design  for the most part  is not. So I'm using my own writings as a kind of testing ground for a book that has an interdependency between word and image as a kind of seductive force. I think that one of the things that religions got right was the use of visual wonder to deliver a message. I think this true marriage of art and information is woefully underused in adult literature  and I'm mystified as to why visual wealth is not more commonly used to enhance intellectual wealth. When we look at works like this  we tend to associate them with children's literature. There's an implication that ornamental graphics detract from the seriousness of the content. But I really hope to have the opportunity to change that perception. This book is taking rather a long time  but I'm nearly done. For some reason  I thought it would be a good idea to put an intermission in my talk. And this is it    just to give you and me a moment to catch up. So I do these valentines. I've been sending out valentines on a fairly large scale since     . These are my valentines from      and     . And I started by doing just a single image like this and sending them out to each person. But in       I got the cockamamie idea to hand draw each valentine for everyone on my mailing list. I reduced my mailing list to     people. And I drew each person their own unique valentine and put their name on it and numbered it and signed it and sent it out. Believe it or not  I devised this as a timesaving method. I was very busy in the beginning of that year  and I didn't know when I was going to find time to design and print a single valentine. And I thought that I could kind of do this piecemeal as I was traveling. It didn't exactly work out that way. There's a longer story to this  but I did get them all done in time  and they were extremely well received. I got an almost     percent response rate. And those who didn't respond will never receive anything from me ever again. Last year  I took a more conceptual approach to the valentine. I had this idea that I wanted people to receive a kind of mysterious love letter  like a found fragment in their mailbox. I wanted it to be something that was not addressed to them or signed by me  something that caused them to wonder what on Earth this thing was. And I specifically wrote four pages that don't connect. There were four different versions of this. And I wrote them so that they begin in the middle of a sentence  end in the middle of a sentence. And they're on the one hand  universal  so I avoid specific names or places  but on the other hand  they're personal. So I wanted people to really get the sense that they had received something that could have been a love letter to them. And I'm just going to read one of them to you.  You've never really been sure of this  but I can assure you that this quirk you're so self conscious of is intensely endearing. Just please accept that this piece of you escapes with your smile  and those of us who notice are happy to catch it in passing. Time spent with you is like chasing and catching small birds  but without the scratches and bird shit.   That is to say  your thoughts and words flit and dart  disconcertedly elusive at times  but when caught and examined    ahh  such a wonder  such a delightful reward. There's no passing time with you  only collecting    the collecting of moments with the hope for preservation and at the same time release. Impossible  I don't think so. I know this makes you embarrassed. I'm certain I can see you blushing. But I just have to tell you because sometimes I hear your self doubt  and it's so crushing to think that you may not know how truly wonderful you are  how inspiring and delightful and really  truly the most completely ...  So Valentine's Day is coming up in a couple of days  and these are currently arriving in mailboxes all around the world. This year  I got  what I really have to say is a rather brilliant idea  to laser cut my valentines out of used Christmas cards. So I solicited friends to send me their used Christmas cards  and I made     of these. Each one of them is completely different. I'm just really  really thrilled with them. I don't have that much else to say  but they turned out really well. I do spend a lot of time on my work. And one of the things that I've been thinking about recently is what is worth while. What is it that's worth spending my time on and my life on in this way  Working in the commercial world  this is something that I do have to struggle with at times. And yes  sometimes I'm swayed by money. But ultimately  I don't consider that a worthy goal. What makes something worthwhile for me is the people I work for or with  the conditions I work under and the audience that I'm able to reach. So I might ask   Who is it for    What does it say   and  What does it do   You know  I have to tell you  it's really difficult for someone like me to come up on stage at this conference with these unbelievably brilliant minds  who are thinking these really big picture  world changing  life changing ideas and technologies. And it's very  very common for designers and people in the visual arts to feel that we're not contributing enough  or worse  that all we're doing is contributing to landfill. Here I am  I'm showing you some pretty visuals and talking about aesthetics. But I've come to believe that truly imaginative visual work is extremely important in society. Just in the way that I'm inspired by books and magazines of all kinds  conversations I have  movies  so I also think  when I put visual work out there into the mass media  work that is interesting  unusual  intriguing  work that maybe opens up that sense of inquiry in the mind  that I'm seeding the imagination of the populace. And you just never know who is going to take something from that and turn it into something else  because inspiration is cross pollinating. So a piece of mine may inspire a playwright or a novelist or a scientist  and that in turn may be the seed that inspires a doctor or a philanthropist or a babysitter. And this isn't something that you can quantify or track or measure  and we tend to undervalue things in society that we can't measure. But I really believe that a fully operating  rich society needs these seeds coming from all directions and all disciplines in order to keep the gears of inspiration and imagination flowing and cycling and growing. So that's why I do what I do  and why I spend so much time and effort on it  and why I work in the commercial  public sphere  as opposed to the isolated  private sphere of fine art  because I want as many people as possible to see my work  notice it  be drawn into it  and be able to take something from it. And I actually really feel that it's worthwhile to spend my valuable and limited time on this Earth in this way. And I thank you for allowing me to show it to you. It's a great pleasure to be here. It's a great pleasure to speak after Brian Cox from CERN. I think CERN is the home of the Large Hadron Collider. What ever happened to the Small Hadron Collider  Where is the Small Hadron Collider  Because the Small Hadron Collider once was the big thing. Now  the Small Hadron Collider is in a cupboard  overlooked and neglected. You know when the Large Hadron Collider started  and it didn't work  and people tried to work out why  it was the Small Hadron Collider team who sabotaged it because they were so jealous. The whole Hadron Collider family needs unlocking. The lesson of Brian's presentation  in a way    all those fantastic pictures    is this really  that vantage point determines everything that you see. What Brian was saying was science has opened up successively different vantage points from which we can see ourselves  and that's why it's so valuable. So the vantage point you take determines virtually everything that you will see. The question that you will ask will determine much of the answer that you get. And so if you ask this question  Where would you look to see the future of education  The answer that we've traditionally given to that is very straightforward  at least in the last    years  You go to Finland. Finland is the best place in the world to see school systems. The Finns may be a bit boring and depressive and there's a very high suicide rate  but by golly  they are qualified. And they have absolutely amazing education systems. So we all troop off to Finland  and we wonder at the social democratic miracle of Finland and its cultural homogeneity and all the rest of it  and then we struggle to imagine how we might bring lessons back. Well  so  for this last year  with the help of Cisco who sponsored me  for some balmy reason  to do this  I've been looking somewhere else. Because actually radical innovation does sometimes come from the very best  but it often comes from places where you have huge need    unmet  latent demand    and not enough resources for traditional solutions to work    traditional  high cost solutions  which depend on professionals  which is what schools and hospitals are. So I ended up in places like this. This is a place called Monkey Hill. It's one of the hundreds of favelas in Rio. Most of the population growth of the next    years will be in cities. We'll grow by six cities of    million people a year for the next    years. Almost all of that growth will be in the developed world. Almost all of that growth will be in places like Monkey Hill. This is where you'll find the fastest growing young populations of the world. So if you want recipes to work    for virtually anything    health  education  government politics and education    you have to go to these places. And if you go to these places  you meet people like this. This is a guy called Juanderson. At the age of     in common with many    year olds in the Brazilian education system  he dropped out of school. It was boring. And Juanderson  instead  went into what provided kind of opportunity and hope in the place that he lived  which was the drugs trade. And by the age of     with rapid promotion  he was running the drugs trade in    favelas. He was turning over         dollars a week. He employed     people. He was going to be dead by the age of   . And luckily  he met this guy  who is Rodrigo Baggio  the owner of the first laptop to ever appear in Brazil.       Rodrigo started something called CDI  which took computers donated by corporations  put them into community centers in favelas and created places like this. What turned Juanderson around was technology for learning that made learning fun and accessible. Or you can go to places like this. This is Kibera  which is the largest slum in East Africa. Millions of people living here  stretched over many kilometers. And there I met these two  Azra on the left  Maureen on the right. They just finished their Kenyan certificate of secondary education. That name should tell you that the Kenyan education system borrows almost everything from Britain  circa       but has managed to make it even worse. So there are schools in slums like this. They're places like this. That's where Maureen went to school. They're private schools. There are no state schools in slums. And the education they got was pitiful. It was in places like this. This a school set up by some nuns in another slum called Nakuru. Half the children in this classroom have no parents because they've died through AIDS. The other half have one parent because the other parent has died through AIDS. So the challenges of education in this kind of place are not to learn the kings and queens of Kenya or Britain. They are to stay alive  to earn a living  to not become HIV positive. The one technology that spans rich and poor in places like this is not anything to do with industrial technology. It's not to do with electricity or water. It's the mobile phone. If you want to design from scratch virtually any service in Africa  you would start now with the mobile phone. Or you could go to places like this. This is a place called the Madangiri Settlement Colony  which is a very developed slum about    minutes outside New Delhi  where I met these characters who showed me around for the day. The remarkable thing about these girls  and the sign of the kind of social revolution sweeping through the developing world is that these girls are not married. Ten years ago  they certainly would have been married. Now they're not married  and they want to go on to study further  to have a career. They've been brought up by mothers who are illiterate  who have never ever done homework. All across the developing world there are millions of parents    tens  hundreds of millions    who for the first time are with children doing homework and exams. And the reason they carry on studying is not because they went to a school like this. This is a private school. This is a fee pay school. This is a good school. This is the best you can get in Hyderabad in Indian education. The reason they went on studying was this. This is a computer installed in the entrance to their slum by a revolutionary social entrepreneur called Sugata Mitra who has conducted the most radical experiments  showing that children  in the right conditions  can learn on their own with the help of computers. Those girls have never touched Google. They know nothing about Wikipedia. Imagine what their lives would be like if you could get that to them. So if you look  as I did  through this tour  and by looking at about a hundred case studies of different social entrepreneurs working in these very extreme conditions  look at the recipes that they come up with for learning  they look nothing like school. What do they look like  Well  education is a global religion. And education  plus technology  is a great source of hope. You can go to places like this. This is a school three hours outside of Sao Paulo. Most of the children there have parents who are illiterate. Many of them don't have electricity at home. But they find it completely obvious to use computers  websites  make videos  so on and so forth. When you go to places like this what you see is that education in these settings works by pull  not push. Most of our education system is push. I was literally pushed to school. When you get to school  things are pushed at you  knowledge  exams  systems  timetables. If you want to attract people like Juanderson who could  for instance  buy guns  wear jewelry  ride motorbikes and get girls through the drugs trade  and you want to attract him into education  having a compulsory curriculum doesn't really make sense. That isn't really going to attract him. You need to pull him. And so education needs to work by pull  not push. And so the idea of a curriculum is completely irrelevant in a setting like this. You need to start education from things that make a difference to them in their settings. What does that  Well  the key is motivation  and there are two aspects to it. One is to deliver extrinsic motivation  that education has a payoff. Our education systems all work on the principle that there is a payoff  but you have to wait quite a long time. That's too long if you're poor. Waiting    years for the payoff from education is too long when you need to meet daily needs  when you've got siblings to look after or a business to help with. So you need education to be relevant and help people to make a living there and then  often. And you also need to make it intrinsically interesting. So time and again  I found people like this. This is an amazing guy  Sebastiao Rocha  in Belo Horizonte  in the third largest city in Brazil. He's invented more than     games to teach virtually any subject under the sun. In the schools and communities that Taio works in  the day always starts in a circle and always starts from a question. Imagine an education system that started from questions  not from knowledge to be imparted  or started from a game  not from a lesson  or started from the premise that you have to engage people first before you can possibly teach them. Our education systems  you do all that stuff afterward  if you're lucky  sport  drama  music. These things  they teach through. They attract people to learning because it's really a dance project or a circus project or  the best example of all    El Sistema in Venezuela    it's a music project. And so you attract people through that into learning  not adding that on after all the learning has been done and you've eaten your cognitive greens. So El Sistema in Venezuela uses a violin as a technology of learning. Taio Rocha uses making soap as a technology of learning. And what you find when you go to these schemes is that they use people and places in incredibly creative ways. Masses of peer learning. How do you get learning to people when there are no teachers  when teachers won't come  when you can't afford them  and even if you do get teachers  what they teach isn't relevant to the communities that they serve  Well  you create your own teachers. You create peer to peer learning  or you create para teachers  or you bring in specialist skills. But you find ways to get learning that's relevant to people through technology  people and places that are different. So this is a school in a bus on a building site in Pune  the fastest growing city in Asia. Pune has       building sites. It has        children on those building sites. That's one city. Imagine that urban explosion that's going to take place across the developing world and how many thousands of children will spend their school years on building sites. Well  this is a very simple scheme to get the learning to them through a bus. And they all treat learning  not as some sort of academic  analytical activity  but as that's something that's productive  something you make  something that you can do  perhaps earn a living from. So I met this character  Steven. He'd spent three years in Nairobi living on the streets because his parents had died of AIDS. And he was finally brought back into school  not by the offer of GCSEs  but by the offer of learning how to become a carpenter  a practical making skill. So the trendiest schools in the world  High Tech High and others  they espouse a philosophy of learning as productive activity. Here  there isn't really an option. Learning has to be productive in order for it to make sense. And finally  they have a different model of scale  and it's a Chinese restaurant model of how to scale. And I learned it from this guy  who is an amazing character. He's probably the most remarkable social entrepreneur in education in the world. His name is Madhav Chavan  and he created something called Pratham. And Pratham runs preschool play groups for  now     million children in India. It's the largest NGO in education in the world. And it also supports working class kids going into Indian schools. He's a complete revolutionary. He's actually a trade union organizer by background  and that's how he learned the skills to build his organization. When they got to a certain stage  Pratham got big enough to attract some pro bono support from McKinsey. McKinsey came along and looked at his model and said   You know what you should do with this  Madhav  You should turn it into McDonald's. And what you do when you go to any new site is you kind of roll out a franchise. And it's the same wherever you go. It's reliable and people know exactly where they are. And there will be no mistakes.  And Madhav said   Why do we have to do it that way  Why can't we do it more like the Chinese restaurants   There are Chinese restaurants everywhere  but there is no Chinese restaurant chain. Yet  everyone knows what is a Chinese restaurant. They know what to expect  even though it'll be subtly different and the colors will be different and the name will be different. You know a Chinese restaurant when you see it. These people work with the Chinese restaurant model    same principles  different applications and different settings    not the McDonald's model. The McDonald's model scales. The Chinese restaurant model spreads. So mass education started with social entrepreneurship in the   th century. And that's desperately what we need again on a global scale. And what can we learn from all of that  Well  we can learn a lot because our education systems are failing desperately in many ways. They fail to reach the people they most need to serve. They often hit their target but miss the point. Improvement is increasingly difficult to organize  our faith in these systems  incredibly fraught. And this is just a very simple way of understanding what kind of innovation  what kind of different design we need. There are two basic types of innovation. There's sustaining innovation  which will sustain an existing institution or an organization  and disruptive innovation that will break it apart  create some different way of doing it. There are formal settings    schools  colleges  hospitals    in which innovation can take place  and informal settings    communities  families  social networks. Almost all our effort goes in this box  sustaining innovation in formal settings  getting a better version of the essentially Bismarckian school system that developed in the   th century. And as I said  the trouble with this is that  in the developing world there just aren't teachers to make this model work. You'd need millions and millions of teachers in China  India  Nigeria and the rest of developing world to meet need. And in our system  we know that simply doing more of this won't eat into deep educational inequalities  especially in inner cities and former industrial areas. So that's why we need three more kinds of innovation. We need more reinvention. And all around the world now you see more and more schools reinventing themselves. They're recognizably schools  but they look different. There are Big Picture schools in the U.S. and Australia. There are Kunskapsskolan schools in Sweden. Of    of them  only two of them are in schools. Most of them are in other buildings not designed as schools. There is an amazing school in Northen Queensland called Jaringan. And they all have the same kind of features  highly collaborative  very personalized  often pervasive technology  learning that starts from questions and problems and projects  not from knowledge and curriculum. So we certainly need more of that. But because so many of the issues in education aren't just in school  they're in family and community  what you also need  definitely  is more on the right hand side. You need efforts to supplement schools. The most famous of these is Reggio Emilia in Italy  the family based learning system to support and encourage people in schools. The most exciting is the Harlem Children's Zone  which over    years  led by Geoffrey Canada  has  through a mixture of schooling and family and community projects  attempted to transform not just education in schools  but the entire culture and aspiration of about        families in Harlem. We need more of that completely new and radical thinking. You can go to places an hour away  less  from this room  just down the road  which need that  which need radicalism of a kind that we haven't imagined. And finally  you need transformational innovation that could imagine getting learning to people in completely new and different ways. So we are on the verge        of an amazing achievement  the schoolification of the world. Every child up to the age of    who wants a place in school will be able to have one in     . It's an amazing thing. But it is  unlike cars  which have developed so rapidly and orderly  actually the school system is recognizably an inheritance from the   th century  from a Bismarkian model of German schooling that got taken up by English reformers  and often by religious missionaries  taken up in the United States as a force of social cohesion  and then in Japan and South Korea as they developed. It's recognizably   th century in its roots. And of course it's a huge achievement. And of course it will bring great things. It will bring skills and learning and reading. But it will also lay waste to imagination. It will lay waste to appetite. It will lay waste to social confidence. It will stratify society as much as it liberates it. And we are bequeathing to the developing world school systems that they will now spend a century trying to reform. That is why we need really radical thinking  and why radical thinking is now more possible and more needed than ever in how we learn. Thank you.  Applause  When I was    years old  a cousin of mine took me on a tour of his medical school. And as a special treat  he took me to the pathology lab and took a real human brain out of the jar and placed it in my hands. And there it was  the seat of human consciousness  the powerhouse of the human body  sitting in my hands. And that day I knew that when I grew up  I was going to become a brain doctor  scientist  something or the other. Years later  when I finally grew up  my dream came true. And it was while I was doing my Ph.D. on the neurological causes of dyslexia in children that I encountered a startling fact that I'd like to share with you all today. It is estimated that one in six children  that's one in six children  suffer from some developmental disorder. This is a disorder that retards mental development in the child and causes permanent mental impairments. Which means that each and every one of you here today knows at least one child that is suffering from a developmental disorder. But here's what really perplexed me. Despite the fact that each and every one of these disorders originates in the brain  most of these disorders are diagnosed solely on the basis of observable behavior. But diagnosing a brain disorder without actually looking at the brain is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem based on their physical symptoms  without even doing an ECG or a chest X ray to look at the heart. It seemed so intuitive to me. To diagnose and treat a brain disorder accurately  it would be necessary to look at the brain directly. Looking at behavior alone can miss a vital piece of the puzzle and provide an incomplete  or even a misleading  picture of the child's problems. Yet  despite all the advances in medical technology  the diagnosis of brain disorders in one in six children still remained so limited. And then I came across a team at Harvard University that had taken one such advanced medical technology and finally applied it  instead of in brain research  towards diagnosing brain disorders in children. Their groundbreaking technology records the EEG  or the electrical activity of the brain  in real time  allowing us to watch the brain as it performs various functions and then detect even the slightest abnormality in any of these functions  vision  attention  language  audition. A program called Brain Electrical Activity Mapping then triangulates the source of that abnormality in the brain. And another program called Statistical Probability Mapping then performs mathematical calculations to determine whether any of these abnormalities are clinically significant  allowing us to provide a much more accurate neurological diagnosis of the child's symptoms. And so I became the head of neurophysiology for the clinical arm of this team  and we're finally able to use this technology towards actually helping children with brain disorders. And I'm happy to say that I'm now in the process of setting up this technology here in India. I'd like to tell you about one such child  whose story was also covered by ABC News. Seven year old Justin Senigar came to our clinic with this diagnosis of very severe autism. Like many autistic children  his mind was locked inside his body. There were moments when he would actually space out for seconds at a time. And the doctors told his parents he was never going to be able to communicate or interact socially  and he would probably never have too much language. When we used this groundbreaking EEG technology to actually look at Justin's brain  the results were startling. It turned out that Justin was almost certainly not autistic. He was suffering from brain seizures that were impossible to see with the naked eye  but that were actually causing symptoms that mimicked those of autism. After Justin was given anti seizure medication  the change in him was amazing. Within a period of    days  his vocabulary went from two to three words to     words. And his communication and social interaction were improved so dramatically that he was enrolled into a regular school and even became a karate super champ. Research shows that    percent of children  almost    percent of children diagnosed with autism are actually suffering from hidden brain seizures. These are the faces of the children that I have tested with stories just like Justin. All these children came to our clinic with a diagnosis of autism  attention deficit disorder  mental retardation  language problems. Instead  our EEG scans revealed very specific problems hidden within their brains that couldn't possibly have been detected by their behavioral assessments. So these EEG scans enabled us to provide these children with a much more accurate neurological diagnosis and much more targeted treatment. For too long now  children with developmental disorders have suffered from misdiagnosis while their real problems have gone undetected and left to worsen. And for too long  these children and their parents have suffered undue frustration and desperation. But we are now in a new era of neuroscience  one in which we can finally look directly at brain function in real time with no risks and no side effects  non invasively  and find the true source of so many disabilities in children. So if I could inspire even a fraction of you in the audience today to share this pioneering diagnostic approach with even one parent whose child is suffering from a developmental disorder  then perhaps one more puzzle in one more brain will be solved. One more mind will be unlocked. And one more child who has been misdiagnosed or even undiagnosed by the system will finally realize his or her true potential while there's still time for his or her brain to recover. And all this by simply watching the child's brainwaves. Thank you. So  these are the Dark Ages. And the Dark Ages are the time between when you put away the Lego for the last time as a kid  and you decide as an adult that it is okay to play with a kid's toy. Started out with my then four year old   Oh  should buy the kid some Lego. That stuff's cool.  Walked into the Lego store. Bought him this. It's totally appropriate for a four year old. I think the box says    let's see here       to     on it. I turn to my wife and said   Who are we buying this for   She's like   Oh  us.  I'm like   Okay. All right. That's cool.  Pretty soon it got a little bit out of control. The dining room looked like this. You walk there  and it hurts. So we took a room downstairs in the basement that had been used as sort of an Abu Ghraib annex. Torture  very funny. Wow  you guys are great. And we put down those little floor tiles  and then I went onto eBay and bought     pounds of Lego    which is insane. My daughter    the day we got it  I was tucking her in    and I said   Honey  you're my treasure.  And she said   No  the Lego is the treasure.  And then she said   Dad  we're Lego rich.  I was like   Yeah. I suppose we are.  So then once you do that you're like   Oh  crap. Where am I going to put all this   So you go to The Container Store and spend an enormous amount of money  and then you start this crazy sorting process that never    it's just nuts. Whatever. So then you realize there are these conventions. And you go to one of these conventions  and some dude built the Titanic. And you're like   Holy shit  He had to come in like a truck  a semi  with this thing.  And then someone built this    this is the Smith Tower in Seattle. Just beautiful. And there's a dude selling these aftermarket weapons for Lego  because Lego    the Danish    no  they're not into guns. But the Americans  Oh  we'll make some guns for Lego  no problem. And at a certain point  you look around  you're like   Whoa  this is a really nerdy crowd.  And I mean like this is a nerdy crowd  but that's like a couple of levels above furries. The nerds here  they get laid    except for the lady with the condoms in her pocket    and you say to yourself at some point   Am I part of this group  Like  am I into this   And I was just like   Yeah  I guess I am. I'm coming out. I'm kind of into this stuff  and I'm going to stop being embarrassed.  So then you really get into it  and you're like   Well  the Lego people in Denmark  they've got all this software to let you build your own virtually.  And so this is like this CAD program where you build it. And then whatever you design virtually  you click the button and it shows up at your doorstep a week later. And then some of the designs that people do they actually sell in the store. The Lego guys don't give you any royalties  strangely  but some user made this and then it sold. And it's pretty amazing actually. Then you notice that if that Lego provided CAD program isn't enough  there's an entire open source  third party  independent Lego CAD program that lets you do  D modeling and  D rendering and make  in fact  movies out of Lego   D films of which there are thousands on YouTube  and some of them sort of mimicking famous films and some totally original content    just beautiful    and people recreating all sorts of things. I have to take a moment. I love the guy who's like running away with his clasps  his hooks. Okay. Anyway. There's a whole programming language and robotics tool  so if you want to teach someone how to program  kid  adult  whatever it is. And the guy that made this  he made a slot machine out of Lego. And I don't mean he made Lego that looked like a slot machine  I mean he made a slot machine out of Lego. The insides were Lego. There's people getting drunk building Lego  and you've got to finish the thing before you puke. There's a whole gray market for Lego  thousands of home based businesses. And some people will fund their entire Lego habit by selling the little guy  but then you have no guys in your ships. And then  just some examples. This stuff really is sculpture. This is amazing what you can do. And don't kid yourself  some architectural details  incredible organic shapes and just  even  nature out of  again  little blocks. This is my house. And this is my house. I was afraid a car was going to come smash it as I was taking a picture for you guys. Anyway  I'm out of time. But just very quickly    we'll just see if I can do this quick. Because there aren't enough TED logos around here. Let's see here. Okay. Ta da. The story starts in Kenya in December of       when there was a disputed presidential election  and in the immediate aftermath of that election  there was an outbreak of ethnic violence. And there was a lawyer in Nairobi  Ory Okolloh    who some of you may know from her TEDTalk    who began blogging about it on her site  Kenyan Pundit. And shortly after the election and the outbreak of violence  the government suddenly imposed a significant media blackout. And so weblogs went from being commentary as part of the media landscape to being a critical part of the media landscape in trying to understand where the violence was. And Okolloh solicited from her commenters more information about what was going on. The comments began pouring in  and Okolloh would collate them. She would post them. And she quickly said   It's too much. I could do this all day every day and I can't keep up. There is more information about what's going on in Kenya right now than any one person can manage. If only there was a way to automate this.  And two programmers who read her blog held their hands up and said   We could do that   and in    hours  they launched Ushahidi. Ushahidi    the name means  witness  or  testimony  in Swahili    is a very simple way of taking reports from the field  whether it's from the web or  critically  via mobile phones and SMS  aggregating it and putting it on a map. That's all it is  but that's all that's needed because what it does is it takes the tacit information available to the whole population    everybody knows where the violence is  but no one person knows what everyone knows    and it takes that tacit information and it aggregates it  and it maps it and it makes it public. And that  that maneuver called  crisis mapping   was kicked off in Kenya in January of     . And enough people looked at it and found it valuable enough that the programmers who created Ushahidi decided they were going to make it open source and turn it into a platform. It's since been deployed in Mexico to track electoral fraud. It's been deployed in Washington D.C. to track snow cleanup. And it's been used most famously in Haiti in the aftermath of the earthquake. And when you look at the map now posted on the Ushahidi front page  you can see that the number of deployments in Ushahidi has gone worldwide  all right  This went from a single idea and a single implementation in East Africa in the beginning of      to a global deployment in less than three years. Now what Okolloh did would not have been possible without digital technology. What Okolloh did would not have been possible without human generosity. And the interesting moment now  the number of environments where the social design challenge relies on both of those things being true. That is the resource that I'm talking about. I call it cognitive surplus. And it represents the ability of the world's population to volunteer and to contribute and collaborate on large  sometimes global  projects. Cognitive surplus is made up of two things. The first  obviously  is the world's free time and talents. The world has over a trillion hours a year of free time to commit to shared projects. Now  that free time existed in the   th century  but we didn't get Ushahidi in the   th century. That's the second half of cognitive surplus. The media landscape in the   th century was very good at helping people consume  and we got  as a result  very good at consuming. But now that we've been given media tools    the Internet  mobile phones    that let us do more than consume  what we're seeing is that people weren't couch potatoes because we liked to be. We were couch potatoes because that was the only opportunity given to us. We still like to consume  of course. But it turns out we also like to create  and we like to share. And it's those two things together    ancient human motivation and the modern tools to allow that motivation to be joined up in large scale efforts    that are the new design resource. And using cognitive surplus  we're starting to see truly incredible experiments in scientific  literary  artistic  political efforts. Designing. We're also getting  of course  a lot of LOLcats. LOLcats are cute pictures of cats made cuter with the addition of cute captions. And they are also part of the abundant media landscape we're getting now. This is one of the participatory    one of the participatory models we see coming out of that  along with Ushahidi. Now I want to stipulate  as the lawyers say  that LOLcats are the stupidest possible creative act. There are other candidates of course  but LOLcats will do as a general case. But here's the thing  The stupidest possible creative act is still a creative act. Someone who has done something like this  however mediocre and throwaway  has tried something  has put something forward in public. And once they've done it  they can do it again  and they could work on getting it better. There is a spectrum between mediocre work and good work  and as anybody who's worked as an artist or a creator knows  it's a spectrum you're constantly struggling to get on top of. The gap is between doing anything and doing nothing. And someone who makes a LOLcat has already crossed over that gap. Now it's tempting to want to get the Ushahidis without the LOLcats  right  to get the serious stuff without the throwaway stuff. But media abundance never works that way. Freedom to experiment means freedom to experiment with anything. Even with the sacred printing press  we got erotic novels     years before we got scientific journals. So before I talk about what is  I think  the critical difference between LOLcats and Ushahidi  I want to talk about their shared source. And that source is design for generosity. It is one of the curiosities of our historical era that even as cognitive surplus is becoming a resource we can design around  social sciences are also starting to explain how important our intrinsic motivations are to us  how much we do things because we like to do them rather than because our boss told us to do them  or because we're being paid to do them. This is a graph from a paper by Uri Gneezy and Aldo Rustichini  who set out to test  at the beginning of this decade  what they called  deterrence theory.  And deterrence theory is a very simple theory of human behavior  If you want somebody to do less of something  add a punishment and they'll do less of it. Simple  straightforward  commonsensical    also  largely untested. And so they went and studied    daycare centers in Haifa  Israel. They studied those daycare centers at the time of highest tension  which is pick up time. At pick up time the teachers  who have been with your children all day  would like you to be there at the appointed hour to take your children back. Meanwhile  the parents    perhaps a little busy at work  running late  running errands    want a little slack to pick the kids up late. So Gneezy and Rustichini said   How many instances of late pick ups are there at these    daycare centers   Now they saw    and this is what the graph is  these are the number of weeks and these are the number of late arrivals    that there were between six and    instances of late pick ups on average in these    daycare centers. So they divided the daycare centers into two groups. The white group there is the control group  they change nothing. But the group of daycare centers represented by the black line  they said   We are changing this bargain as of right now. If you pick your kid up more than    minutes late  we're going to add a    shekel fine to your bill. Boom. No ifs  ands or buts.  And the minute they did that  the behavior in those daycare centers changed. Late pick ups went up every week for the next four weeks until they topped out at triple the pre fine average  and then they fluctuated at between double and triple the pre fine average for the life of the fine. And you can see immediately what happened  right  The fine broke the culture of the daycare center. By adding a fine  what they did was communicate to the parents that their entire debt to the teachers had been discharged with the payment of    shekels  and that there was no residue of guilt or social concern that the parents owed the teachers. And so the parents  quite sensibly  said      shekels to pick my kid up late  What could be bad   The explanation of human behavior that we inherited in the   th century was that we are all rational  self maximizing actors  and in that explanation    the daycare center had no contract    should have been operating without any constraints. But that's not right. They were operating with social constraints rather than contractual ones. And critically  the social constraints created a culture that was more generous than the contractual constraints did. So Gneezy and Rustichini run this experiment for a dozen weeks    run the fine for a dozen weeks    and then they say   Okay  that's it. All done  fine.  And then a really interesting thing happens  Nothing changes. The culture that got broken by the fine stayed broken when the fine was removed. Not only are economic motivations and intrinsic motivations incompatible  that incompatibility can persist over long periods. So the trick in designing these kinds of situations is to understand where you're relying on the economic part of the bargain    as with the parents paying the teachers    and when you're relying on the social part of the bargain  when you're really designing for generosity. This brings me back to the LOLcats and to Ushahidi. This is  I think  the range that matters. Both of these rely on cognitive surplus. Both of these design for the assumption that people like to create and we want to share. Here is the critical difference between these  LOLcats is communal value. It's value created by the participants for each other. Communal value on the networks we have is everywhere    every time you see a large aggregate of shared  publicly available data  whether it's photos on Flickr or videos on Youtube or whatever. This is good. I like LOLcats as much as the next guy  maybe a little more even  but this is also a largely solved problem. I have a hard time envisioning a future in which someone is saying   Where  oh where  can I find a picture of a cute cat   Ushahidi  by contrast  is civic value. It's value created by the participants but enjoyed by society as a whole. The goals set out by Ushahidi are not just to make life better for the participants  but to make life better for everyone in the society in which Ushahidi is operating. And that kind of civic value is not just a side effect of opening up to human motivation. It really is going to be a side effect of what we  collectively  make of these kinds of efforts. There are a trillion hours a year of participatory value up for grabs. That will be true year in and year out. The number of people who are going to be able to participate in these kinds of projects is going to grow  and we can see that organizations designed around a culture of generosity can achieve incredible effects without an enormous amount of contractual overhead    a very different model than our default model for large scale group action in the   th century. What's going to make the difference here is what Dean Kamen said  the inventor and entrepreneur. Kamen said   Free cultures get what they celebrate.  We've got a choice before us. We've got this trillion hours a year. We can use it to crack each other up  and we're going to do that. That  we get for free. But we can also celebrate and support and reward the people trying to use cognitive surplus to create civic value. And to the degree we're going to do that  to the degree we're able to do that  we'll be able to change society. Thank you very much. In the last    years  we've been building the suburbs with a lot of unintended consequences. And I'm going to talk about some of those consequences and just present a whole bunch of really interesting projects that I think give us tremendous reasons to be really optimistic that the big design and development project of the next    years is going to be retrofitting suburbia. So whether it's redeveloping dying malls or re inhabiting dead big box stores or reconstructing wetlands out of parking lots  I think the fact is the growing number of empty and under performing  especially retail  sites throughout suburbia gives us actually a tremendous opportunity to take our least sustainable landscapes right now and convert them into more sustainable places. And in the process  what that allows us to do is to redirect a lot more of our growth back into existing communities that could use a boost  and have the infrastructure in place  instead of continuing to tear down trees and to tear up the green space out at the edges. So why is this important  I think there are any number of reasons  and I'm just going to not get into detail but mention a few. Just from the perspective of climate change  the average urban dweller in the U.S. has about one third the carbon footprint of the average suburban dweller  mostly because suburbanites drive a lot more  and living in detached buildings  you have that much more exterior surface to leak energy out of. So strictly from a climate change perspective  the cities are already relatively green. The big opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is actually in urbanizing the suburbs. All that driving that we've been doing out in the suburbs  we have doubled the amount of miles we drive. It's increased our dependence on foreign oil despite the gains in fuel efficiency. We're just driving so much more  we haven't been able to keep up technologically. Public health is another reason to consider retrofitting. Researchers at the CDC and other places have increasingly been linking suburban development patterns with sedentary lifestyles. And those have been linked then with the rather alarming  growing rates of obesity  shown in these maps here  and that obesity has also been triggering great increases in heart disease and diabetes to the point where a child born today has a one in three chance of developing diabetes. And that rate has been escalating at the same rate as children not walking to school anymore  again  because of our development patterns. And then there's finally    there's the affordability question. I mean  how affordable is it to continue to live in suburbia with rising gas prices  Suburban expansion to cheap land  for the last    years    you know the cheap land out on the edge    has helped generations of families enjoy the American dream. But increasingly  the savings promised by drive till you qualify affordability    which is basically our model    those savings are wiped out when you consider the transportation costs. For instance  here in Atlanta  about half of households make between         and         a year  and they are spending    percent of their income on housing and    percent on transportation. I mean  that's      figures. That's before we got up to the four bucks a gallon. You know  none of us really tend to do the math on our transportation costs  and they're not going down any time soon. Whether you love suburbia's leafy privacy or you hate its soulless commercial strips  there are reasons why it's important to retrofit. But is it practical  I think it is. June Williamson and I have been researching this topic for over a decade  and we've found over    varied projects. But that they're really all market driven  and what's driving the market in particular    number one    is major demographic shifts. We all tend to think of suburbia as this very family focused place  but that's really not the case anymore. Since       already two thirds of households in suburbia did not have kids in them. We just haven't caught up with the actual realities of this. The reasons for this have a lot to with the dominance of the two big demographic groups right now  the Baby Boomers retiring    and then there's a gap  Generation X  which is a small generation. They're still having kids    but Generation Y hasn't even started hitting child rearing age. They're the other big generation. So as a result of that  demographers predict that through          to    percent of new households will not have kids in them. And the market research  consumer research  asking the Boomers and Gen Y what it is they would like  what they would like to live in  tells us there is going to be a huge demand    and we're already seeing it    for more urban lifestyles within suburbia. That basically  the Boomers want to be able to age in place  and Gen Y would like to live an urban lifestyle  but most of their jobs will continue to be out in suburbia. The other big dynamic of change is the sheer performance of underperforming asphalt. Now I keep thinking this would be a great name for an indie rock band  but developers generally use it to refer to underused parking lots    and suburbia is full of them. When the postwar suburbs were first built out on the cheap land away from downtown  it made sense to just build surface parking lots. But those sites have now been leapfrogged and leapfrogged again  as we've just continued to sprawl  and they now have a relatively central location. It no longer just makes sense. That land is more valuable than just surface parking lots. It now makes sense to go back in  build a deck and build up on those sites. So what do you do with a dead mall  dead office park  It turns out  all sorts of things. In a slow economy like ours  re inhabitation is one of the more popular strategies. So this happens to be a dead mall in St. Louis that's been re inhabited as art space. It's now home to artist studios  theater groups  dance troupes. It's not pulling in as much tax revenue as it once was  but it's serving its community. It's keeping the lights on. It's becoming  I think  a really great institution. Other malls have been re inhabited as nursing homes  as universities  and as all variety of office space. We also found a lot of examples of dead big box stores that have been converted into all sorts of community serving uses as well    lots of schools  lots of churches and lots of libraries like this one. This was a little grocery store  a Food Lion grocery store  that is now a public library. In addition to  I think  doing a beautiful adaptive reuse  they tore up some of the parking spaces  put in bioswales to collect and clean the runoff  put in a lot more sidewalks to connect to the neighborhoods. And they've made this  what was just a store along a commercial strip  into a community gathering space. This one is a little L shaped strip shopping center in Phoenix  Arizona. Really all they did was they gave it a fresh coat of bright paint  a gourmet grocery  and they put up a restaurant in the old post office. Never underestimate the power of food to turn a place around and make it a destination. It's been so successful  they've now taken over the strip across the street. The real estate ads in the neighborhood all very proudly proclaim   Walking distance to Le Grande Orange   because it provided its neighborhood with what sociologists like to call  a third place.  If home is the first place and work is the second place  the third place is where you go to hang out and build community. And especially as suburbia is becoming less centered on the family  the family households  there's a real hunger for more third places. So the most dramatic retrofits are really those in the next category  the next strategy  redevelopment. Now  during the boom  there were several really dramatic redevelopment projects where the original building was scraped to the ground and then the whole site was rebuilt at significantly greater density  a sort of compact  walkable urban neighborhoods. But some of them have been much more incremental. This is Mashpee Commons  the oldest retrofit that we've found. And it's just incrementally  over the last    years  built urbanism on top of its parking lots. So the black and white photo shows the simple   's strip shopping center. And then the maps above that show its gradual transformation into a compact  mixed use New England village  and it has plans now that have been approved for it to connect to new residential neighborhoods across the arterials and over to the other side. So  you know  sometimes it's incremental. Sometimes  it's all at once. This is another infill project on the parking lots  this one of an office park outside of Washington D.C. When Metrorail expanded transit into the suburbs and opened a station nearby to this site  the owners decided to build a new parking deck and then insert on top of their surface lots a new Main Street  several apartments and condo buildings  while keeping the existing office buildings. Here is the site in       It was just a little farm in the village of Hyattsville. By       it had been subdivided into a big mall on one side and the office park on the other and then some buffer sites for a library and a church to the far right. Today  the transit  the Main Street and the new housing have all been built. Eventually  I expect that the streets will probably extend through a redevelopment of the mall. Plans have already been announced for a lot of those garden apartments above the mall to be redeveloped. Transit is a big driver of retrofits. So here's what it looks like. You can sort of see the funky new condo buildings in between the office buildings and the public space and the new Main Street. This one is one of my favorites  Belmar. I think they really built an attractive place here and have just employed all green construction. There's massive P.V. arrays on the roofs as well as wind turbines. This was a very large mall on a hundred acre superblock. It's now    walkable urban blocks with public streets  two public parks  eight bus lines and a range of housing types  and so it's really given Lakewood  Colorado the downtown that this particular suburb never had. Here was the mall in its heyday. They had their prom in the mall. They loved their mall. So here's the site in      with the mall. By       the mall has died. The department store has been kept    and we found this was true in many cases. The department stores are multistory  they're better built. They're easy to be re adapted. But the one story stuff ... that's really history. So here it is at projected build out. This project  I think  has great connectivity to the existing neighborhoods. It's providing       households with the option of a more urban lifestyle. It's about two thirds built out right now. Here's what the new Main Street looks like. It's very successful  and it's helped to prompt    eight of the    regional malls in Denver have now  or have announced plans to be  retrofitted. But it's important to note that all of this retrofitting is not occurring    just bulldozers are coming and just plowing down the whole city. No  it's pockets of walkability on the sites of under performing properties. And so it's giving people more choices  but it's not taking away choices. But it's also not really enough to just create pockets of walkability. You want to also try to get more systemic transformation. We need to also retrofit the corridors themselves. So this is one that has been retrofitted in California. They took the commercial strip shown on the black and white images below  and they built a boulevard that has become the Main Street for their town. And it's transformed from being an ugly  unsafe  undesirable address  to becoming a beautiful  attractive  dignified sort of good address. I mean now we're hoping we start to see it  they've already built City Hall  attracted two hotels. I could imagine beautiful housing going up along there without tearing down another tree. So there's a lot of great things  but I'd love to see more corridors getting retrofitting. But densification is not going to work everywhere. Sometimes re greening is really the better answer. There's a lot to learn from successful landbanking programs in cities like Flint  Michigan. There's also a burgeoning suburban farming movement    sort of victory gardens meets the Internet. But perhaps one of the most important re greening aspects is the opportunity to restore the local ecology  as in this example outside of Minneapolis. When the shopping center died  the city restored the site's original wetlands  creating lakefront property  which then attracted private investment  the first private investment to this very low income neighborhood in over    years. So they've managed to both restore the local ecology and the local economy at the same time. This is another re greening example. It also makes sense in very strong markets. This one in Seattle is on the site of a mall parking lot adjacent to a new transit stop. And the wavy line is a path alongside a creek that has now been daylit. The creek had been culverted under the parking lot. But daylighting our creeks really improves their water quality and contributions to habitat. So I've shown you some of the first generation of retrofits. What's next  I think we have three challenges for the future. The first is to plan retrofitting much more systemically at the metropolitan scale. We need to be able to target which areas really should be re greened. Where should we be redeveloping  And where should we be encouraging re inhabitation  These slides just show two images from a larger project that looked at trying to do that for Atlanta. I led a team that was asked to imagine Atlanta     years from now. And we chose to try to reverse sprawl through three simple moves    expensive  but simple. One  in a hundred years  transit on all major rail and road corridors. Two  in a hundred years  thousand foot buffers on all stream corridors. It's a little extreme  but we've got a little water problem. In a hundred years  subdivisions that simply end up too close to water or too far from transit won't be viable. And so we've created the eco acre transfer to transfer development rights to the transit corridors and allow the re greening of those former subdivisions for food and energy production. So the second challenge is to improve the architectural design quality of the retrofits. And I close with this image of democracy in action  This is a protest that's happening on a retrofit in Silver Spring  Maryland on an Astroturf town green. Now  retrofits are often accused of being examples of faux downtowns and instant urbanism  and not without reason  you don't get much more phony than an Astroturf town green. I have to say  these are very hybrid places. They are new but trying to look old. They have urban streetscapes  but suburban parking ratios. Their populations are more diverse than typical suburbia  but they're less diverse than cities. And they are public places  but that are managed by private companies. And just the surface appearance are often    like the Astroturf here    they make me wince. So  you know  I mean I'm glad that the urbanism is doing its job. The fact that a protest is happening really does mean that the layout of the blocks  the streets and blocks  the putting in of public space  compromised as it may be  is still a really great thing. But we've got to get the architecture better. The final challenge is for all of you. I want you to join the protest and start demanding more sustainable suburban places    more sustainable places  period. But culturally  we tend to think that downtowns should be dynamic  and we expect that. But we seem to have an expectation that the suburbs should forever remain frozen in whatever adolescent form they were first given birth to. It's time to let them grow up  so I want you to all support the zoning changes  the road diets  the infrastructure improvements and the retrofits that are coming soon to a neighborhood near you. Thank you. It can be a very complicated thing  the ocean. And it can be a very complicated thing  what human health is. And bringing those two together might seem a very daunting task  but what I'm going to try to say is that even in that complexity  there's some simple themes that I think  if we understand  we can really move forward. And those simple themes aren't really themes about the complex science of what's going on  but things that we all pretty well know. And I'm going to start with this one  If momma ain't happy  ain't nobody happy. We know that  right  We've experienced that. And if we just take that and we build from there  then we can go to the next step  which is that if the ocean ain't happy  ain't nobody happy. That's the theme of my talk. And we're making the ocean pretty unhappy in a lot of different ways. This is a shot of Cannery Row in     . Cannery Row  at the time  had the biggest industrial canning operation on the west coast. We piled enormous amounts of pollution into the air and into the water. Rolf Bolin  who was a professor at the Hopkin's Marine Station where I work  wrote in the     s that  The fumes from the scum floating on the inlets of the bay were so bad they turned lead based paints black.  People working in these canneries could barely stay there all day because of the smell  but you know what they came out saying  They say   You know what you smell  You smell money.  That pollution was money to that community  and those people dealt with the pollution and absorbed it into their skin and into their bodies because they needed the money. We made the ocean unhappy  we made people very unhappy  and we made them unhealthy. The connection between ocean health and human health is actually based upon another couple simple adages  and I want to call that  pinch a minnow  hurt a whale.  The pyramid of ocean life ... Now  when an ecologist looks at the ocean    I have to tell you    we look at the ocean in a very different way  and we see different things than when a regular person looks at the ocean because when an ecologist looks at the ocean  we see all those interconnections. We see the base of the food chain  the plankton  the small things  and we see how those animals are food to animals in the middle of the pyramid  and on so up this diagram. And that flow  that flow of life  from the very base up to the very top  is the flow that ecologists see. And that's what we're trying to preserve when we say   Save the ocean. Heal the ocean.  It's that pyramid. Now why does that matter for human health  Because when we jam things in the bottom of that pyramid that shouldn't be there  some very frightening things happen. Pollutants  some pollutants have been created by us  molecules like PCBs that can't be broken down by our bodies. And they go in the base of that pyramid  and they drift up  they're passed up that way  on to predators and on to the top predators  and in so doing  they accumulate. Now  to bring that home  I thought I'd invent a little game. We don't really have to play it  we can just think about it here. It's the Styrofoam and chocolate game. Imagine that when we got on this boat  we were all given two Styrofoam peanuts. Can't do much with them  Put them in your pocket. Suppose the rules are  every time you offer somebody a drink  you give them the drink  and you give them your Styrofoam peanuts too. What'll happen is that the Styrofoam peanuts will start moving through our society here  and they will accumulate in the drunkest  stingiest people. There's no mechanism in this game for them to go anywhere but into a bigger and bigger pile of indigestible Styrofoam peanuts. And that's exactly what happens with PDBs in this food pyramid  They accumulate into the top of it. Now suppose  instead of Styrofoam peanuts  we take these lovely little chocolates that we get and we had those instead. Well  some of us would be eating those chocolates instead of passing them around  and instead of accumulating  they will just pass into our group here and not accumulate in any one group because they're absorbed by us. And that's the difference between a PCB and  say  something natural like an omega    something we want out of the marine food chain. PCBs accumulate. We have great examples of that  unfortunately. PCBs accumulate in dolphins in Sarasota Bay  in Texas  in North Carolina. They get into the food chain. The dolphins eat the fish that have PCBs from the plankton  and those PCBs  being fat soluble  accumulate in these dolphins. Now  a dolphin  mother dolphin  any dolphin    there's only one way that a PCB can get out of a dolphin. And what's that  In mother's milk. Here's a diagram of the PCB load of dolphins in Sarasota Bay. Adult males  a huge load. Juveniles  a huge load. Females after their first calf is already weaned  a lower load. Those females  they're not trying to. Those females are passing the PCBs in the fat of their own mother's milk into their offspring  and their offspring don't survive. The death rate in these dolphins  for the first calf born of every female dolphin  is    to    percent. These mothers pump their first offspring full of this pollutant  and most of them die. Now  the mother then can go and reproduce  but what a terrible price to pay for the accumulation of this pollutant in these animals    the death of the first born calf. There's another top predator in the ocean  it turns out. That top predator  of course  is us. And we also are eating meat that comes from some of these same places. This is whale meat that I photographed in a grocery store in Tokyo    or is it  In fact  what we did a few years ago was learn how to smuggle a molecular biology lab into Tokyo and use it to genetically test the DNA out of whale meat samples and identify what they really were. And some of those whale meat samples were whale meat. Some of them were illegal whale meat  by the way. That's another story. But some of them were not whale meat at all. Even though they were labeled whale meat  they were dolphin meat. Some of them were dolphin liver. Some of them were dolphin blubber. And those dolphin parts had a huge load of PCBs  dioxins and heavy metals. And that huge load was passing into the people that ate this meat. It turns out that a lot of dolphins are being sold as meat in the whale meat market around the world. That's a tragedy for those populations  but it's also a tragedy for the people eating them because they don't know that that's toxic meat. We had these data a few years ago. I remember sitting at my desk being about the only person in the world who knew that whale meat being sold in these markets was really dolphin meat  and it was toxic. It had two to three to     times the toxic loads ever allowed by the EPA. And I remember there sitting at my desk thinking   Well  I know this. This is a great scientific discovery   but it was so awful. And for the very first time in my scientific career  I broke scientific protocol  which is that you take the data and publish them in scientific journals and then begin to talk about them. We sent a very polite letter to the Minister of Health in Japan and simply pointed out that this is an intolerable situation  not for us  but for the people of Japan because mothers who may be breastfeeding  who may have young children  would be buying something that they thought was healthy  but it was really toxic. That led to a whole series of other campaigns in Japan  and I'm really proud to say that at this point  it's very difficult to buy anything in Japan that's labeled incorrectly  even though they're still selling whale meat  which I believe they shouldn't. But at least it's labeled correctly  and you're no longer going to be buying toxic dolphin meat instead. It isn't just there that this happens  but in a natural diet of some communities in the Canadian arctic and in the United States and in the European arctic  a natural diet of seals and whales leads to an accumulation of PCBs that have gathered up from all parts of the world and ended up in these women. These women have toxic breast milk. They cannot feed their offspring  their children  their breast milk because of the accumulation of these toxins in their food chain  in their part of the world's ocean pyramid. That means their immune systems are compromised. It means that their children's development can be compromised. And the world's attention on this over the last decade has reduced the problem for these women  not by changing the pyramid  but by changing what they particularly eat out of it. We've taken them out of their natural pyramid in order to solve this problem. That's a good thing for this particular acute problem  but it does nothing to solve the pyramid problem. There's other ways of breaking the pyramid. The pyramid  if we jam things in the bottom  can get backed up like a sewer line that's clogged. And if we jam nutrients  sewage  fertilizer in the base of that food pyramid  it can back up all through it. We end up with things we've heard about before  red tides  for example  which are blooms of toxic algae floating through the oceans causing neurological damage. We can also see blooms of bacteria  blooms of viruses in the ocean. These are two shots of a red tide coming on shore here and a bacteria in the genus vibrio  which includes the genus that has cholera in it. How many people have seen a  beach closed  sign  Why does that happen  It happens because we have jammed so much into the base of the natural ocean pyramid that these bacteria clog it up and overfill onto our beaches. Often what jams us up is sewage. Now how many of you have ever gone to a state park or a national park where you had a big sign at the front saying   Closed because human sewage is so far over this park that you can't use it   Not very often. We wouldn't tolerate that. We wouldn't tolerate our parks being swamped by human sewage  but beaches are closed a lot in our country. They're closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason  and I believe we shouldn't tolerate that either. It's not just a question of cleanliness  it's also a question of how those organisms then turn into human disease. These vibrios  these bacteria  can actually infect people. They can go into your skin and create skin infections. This is a graph from NOAA's ocean and human health initiative  showing the rise of the infections by vibrio in people over the last few years. Surfers  for example  know this incredibly. And if you can see on some surfing sites  in fact  not only do you see what the waves are like or what the weather's like  but on some surf rider sites  you see a little flashing poo alert. That means that the beach might have great waves  but it's a dangerous place for surfers to be because they can carry with them  even after a great day of surfing  this legacy of an infection that might take a very long time to solve. Some of these infections are actually carrying antibiotic resistance genes now  and that makes them even more difficult. These same infections create harmful algal blooms. Those blooms are generating other kinds of chemicals. This is just a simple list of some of the types of poisons that come out of these harmful algal blooms  shellfish poisoning fish ciguatera  diarrheic shellfish poisoning    you don't want to know about that    neurotoxic shellfish poisoning  paralytic shellfish poisoning. These are things that are getting into our food chain because of these blooms. Rita Calwell very famously traced a very interesting story of cholera into human communities  brought there  not by a normal human vector  but by a marine vector  this copepod. Copepods are small crustaceans. They're a tiny fraction of an inch long  and they can carry on their little legs some of the cholera bacteria that then leads to human disease. That has sparked cholera epidemics in ports along the world and has led to increased concentration on trying to make sure shipping doesn't move these vectors of cholera around the world. So what do you do  We have major problems in disrupted ecosystem flow that the pyramid may not be working so well  that the flow from the base up into it is being blocked and clogged. What do you do when you have this sort of disrupted flow  Well  there's a bunch of things you could do. You could call Joe the Plumber  for example. And he could come in and fix the flow. But in fact  if you look around the world  not only are there hope spots for where we may be able to fix problems  there have been places where problems have been fixed  where people have come to grips with these issues and begun to turn them around. Monterey is one of those. I started out showing how much we had distressed the Monterey Bay ecosystem with pollution and the canning industry and all of the attendant problems. In       that's the picture. In       the picture is dramatically different. The canneries are gone. The pollution has abated. But there's a greater sense here that what the individual communities need is working ecosystems. They need a functioning pyramid from the base all the way to the top. And that pyramid in Monterey  right now  because of the efforts of a lot of different people  is functioning better than it's ever functioned for the last     years. It didn't happen accidentally. It happened because many people put their time and effort and their pioneering spirit into this. On the left there  Julia Platt  the mayor of my little hometown in Pacific Grove. At    years old  became mayor because something had to be done to protect the ocean. In       she produced California's first community based marine protected area  right next to the biggest polluting cannery  because Julia knew that when the canneries eventually were gone  the ocean needed a place to grow from  that the ocean needed a place to spark a seed  and she wanted to provide that seed. Other people  like David Packard and Julie Packard  who were instrumental in producing the Monterey Bay aquarium to lock into people's notion that the ocean and the health of the ocean ecosystem were just as important to the economy of this area as eating the ecosystem would be. That change in thinking has led to a dramatic shift  not only in the fortunes of Monterey Bay  but other places around the world. Well  I want to leave you with the thought that what we're really trying to do here is protect this ocean pyramid  and that ocean pyramid connects to our own pyramid of life. It's an ocean planet  and we think of ourselves as a terrestrial species  but the pyramid of life in the ocean and our own lives on land are intricately connected. And it's only through having the ocean being healthy that we can remain healthy ourselves. Thank you very much. It's a great honor today to share with you The Digital Universe  which was created for humanity to really see where we are in the universe. And so I think we can roll the video that we have.  The Himalayas.  The flat horizon that we've evolved with has been a metaphor for the infinite  unbounded resources and unlimited capacity for disposal of waste. It wasn't until we really left Earth  got above the atmosphere and had seen the horizon bend back on itself  that we could understand our planet as a limited condition. The Digital Universe Atlas has been built at the American Museum of Natural History over the past    years. We maintain that  put that together as a project to really chart the universe across all scales. What we see here are satellites around the Earth and the Earth in proper registration against the universe  as we see. NASA supported this work    years ago as part of the rebuilding of the Hayden Planetarium so that we would share this with the world. The Digital Universe is the basis of our space show productions that we do    our main space shows in the dome. But what you see here is the result of  actually  internships that we hosted with Linkoping University in Sweden. I've had    students work on this for their graduate work  and the result has been this software called Uniview and a company called SCISS in Sweden. This software allows interactive use  so this actual flight path and movie that we see here was actually flown live. I captured this live from my laptop in a cafe called Earth Matters on the Lower East Side of Manhattan  where I live  and it was done as a collaborative project with the Rubin Museum of Himalayan Art for an exhibit on comparative cosmology. And so as we move out  we see continuously from our planet all the way out into the realm of galaxies  as we see here  light travel time  giving you a sense of how far away we are. As we move out  the light from these distant galaxies have taken so long  we're essentially backing up into the past. We back so far up we're finally seeing a containment around us    the afterglow of the Big Bang. This is the WMAP microwave background that we see. We'll fly outside it here  just to see this sort of containment. If we were outside this  it would almost be meaningless  in the sense as before time. But this our containment of the visible universe. We know the universe is bigger than that which we can see. Coming back quickly  we see here the radio sphere that we jumped out of in the beginning  but these are positions  the latest positions of exoplanets that we've mapped  and our sun here  obviously  with our own solar system. What you're going to see    we're going to have to jump in here pretty quickly between several orders of magnitude to get down to where we see the solar system    these are the paths of Voyager    Voyager    Pioneer    and Pioneer     the first four spacecraft to have left the solar system. Coming in closer  picking up Earth  orbit of the Moon  and we see the Earth. This map can be updated  and we can add in new data. I know Dr. Carolyn Porco is the camera P.I. for the Cassini mission. But here we see the complex trajectory of the Cassini mission color coded for different mission phases  ingeniously developed so that    encounters with the largest moon  Titan  which is larger that the planet Mercury  diverts the orbit into different parts of mission phase. This software allows us to come close and look at parts of this. This software can also be networked between domes. We have a growing user base of this  and we network domes. And we can network between domes and classrooms. We're actually sharing tours of the universe with the first sub Saharan planetarium in Ghana as well as new libraries that have been built in the ghettos in Columbia and a high school in Cambodia. And the Cambodians have actually controlled the Hayden Planetarium from their high school. This is an image from Saturday  photographed by the Aqua satellite  but through the Uniview software. So you're seeing the edge of the Earth. This is Nepal. This is  in fact  right here is the valley of Lhasa  right here in Tibet. But we can see the haze from fires and so forth in the Ganges valley down below in India. This is Nepal and Tibet. And just in closing  I'd just like to say this beautiful world that we live on    here we see a bit of the snow that some of you may have had to brave in coming out    so I'd like to just say that what the world needs now is a sense of being able to look at ourselves in this much larger condition now and a much larger sense of what home is. Because our home is the universe  and we are the universe  essentially. We carry that in us. And to be able to see our context in this larger sense at all scales helps us all  I think  in understanding where we are and who we are in the universe. Thank you. Why grow homes  Because we can. Right now  America is in an unremitting state of trauma. And there's a cause for that  all right. We've got McPeople  McCars  McHouses. As an architect  I have to confront something like this. So what's a technology that will allow us to make ginormous houses  Well  it's been around for       years. It's called pleaching  or grafting trees together  or grafting inosculate matter into one contiguous  vascular system. And we do something different than what we did in the past  we add kind of a modicum of intelligence to that. We use CNC to make scaffolding to train semi epithetic matter  plants  into a specific geometry that makes a home that we call a Fab Tree Hab. It fits into the environment. It is the environment. It is the landscape  right  And you can have a hundred million of these homes  and it's great because they suck carbon. They're perfect. You can have     million families  or take things out of the suburbs  because these are homes that are a part of the environment. Imagine pre growing a village    it takes about seven to    years    and everything is green. So not only do we do the veggie house  we also do the in vitro meat habitat  or homes that we're doing research on now in Brooklyn  where  as an architecture office  we're for the first of its kind to put in a molecular cell biology lab and start experimenting with regenerative medicine and tissue engineering and start thinking about what the future would be if architecture and biology became one. So we've been doing this for a couple of years  and that's our lab. And what we do is we grow extracellular matrix from pigs. We use a modified inkjet printer  and we print geometry. We print geometry where we can make industrial design objects like  you know  shoes  leather belts  handbags  etc.  where no sentient creature is harmed. It's victimless. It's meat from a test tube. So our theory is that eventually we should be doing this with homes. So here is a typical stud wall  an architectural construction  and this is a section of our proposal for a meat house  where you can see we use fatty cells as insulation  cilia for dealing with wind loads and sphincter muscles for the doors and windows. And we know it's incredibly ugly. It could have been an English Tudor or Spanish Colonial  but we kind of chose this shape. And there it is kind of grown  at least one particular section of it. We had a big show in Prague  and we decided to put it in front of the cathedral so religion can confront the house of meat. That's why we grow homes. Thanks very much. Thank you very much. Please excuse me for sitting  I'm very old. Well  the topic I'm going to discuss is one which is  in a certain sense  very peculiar because it's very old. Roughness is part of human life forever and forever  and ancient authors have written about it. It was very much uncontrollable  and in a certain sense  it seemed to be the extreme of complexity  just a mess  a mess and a mess. There are many different kinds of mess. Now  in fact  by a complete fluke  I got involved many years ago in a study of this form of complexity  and to my utter amazement  I found traces    very strong traces  I must say    of order in that roughness. And so today  I would like to present to you a few examples of what this represents. I prefer the word roughness to the word irregularity because irregularity    to someone who had Latin in my long past youth    means the contrary of regularity. But it is not so. Regularity is the contrary of roughness because the basic aspect of the world is very rough. So let me show you a few objects. Some of them are artificial. Others of them are very real  in a certain sense. Now this is the real. It's a cauliflower. Now why do I show a cauliflower  a very ordinary and ancient vegetable  Because old and ancient as it may be  it's very complicated and it's very simple  both at the same time. If you try to weigh it    of course it's very easy to weigh it  and when you eat it  the weight matters    but suppose you try to measure its surface. Well  it's very interesting. If you cut  with a sharp knife  one of the florets of a cauliflower and look at it separately  you think of a whole cauliflower  but smaller. And then you cut again  again  again  again  again  again  again  again  again  and you still get small cauliflowers. So the experience of humanity has always been that there are some shapes which have this peculiar property  that each part is like the whole  but smaller. Now  what did humanity do with that  Very  very little. So what I did actually is to study this problem  and I found something quite surprising. That one can measure roughness by a number  a number   .    .  and sometimes much more. One day  a friend of mine  to bug me  brought a picture and said   What is the roughness of this curve   I said   Well  just short of  . .  It was  .  . Now  it didn't take me any time. I've been looking at these things for so long. So these numbers are the numbers which denote the roughness of these surfaces. I hasten to say that these surfaces are completely artificial. They were done on a computer  and the only input is a number  and that number is roughness. So on the left  I took the roughness copied from many landscapes. To the right  I took a higher roughness. So the eye  after a while  can distinguish these two very well. Humanity had to learn about measuring roughness. This is very rough  and this is sort of smooth  and this perfectly smooth. Very few things are very smooth. So then if you try to ask questions   What's the surface of a cauliflower   Well  you measure and measure and measure. Each time you're closer  it gets bigger  down to very  very small distances. What's the length of the coastline of these lakes  The closer you measure  the longer it is. The concept of length of coastline  which seems to be so natural because it's given in many cases  is  in fact  complete fallacy  there's no such thing. You must do it differently. What good is that  to know these things  Well  surprisingly enough  it's good in many ways. To begin with  artificial landscapes  which I invented sort of  are used in cinema all the time. We see mountains in the distance. They may be mountains  but they may be just formulae  just cranked on. Now it's very easy to do. It used to be very time consuming  but now it's nothing. Now look at that. That's a real lung. Now a lung is something very strange. If you take this thing  you know very well it weighs very little. The volume of a lung is very small  but what about the area of the lung  Anatomists were arguing very much about that. Some say that a normal male's lung has an area of the inside of a basketball  court . And the others say  no  five basketball  courts . Enormous disagreements. Why so  Because  in fact  the area of the lung is something very ill defined. The bronchi branch  branch  branch and they stop branching  not because of any matter of principle  but because of physical considerations  the mucus  which is in the lung. So what happens is that in a way you have a much bigger lung  but it branches and branches down to distances about the same for a whale  for a man and for a little rodent. Now  what good is it to have that  Well  surprisingly enough  amazingly enough  the anatomists had a very poor idea of the structure of the lung until very recently. And I think that my mathematics  surprisingly enough  has been of great help to the surgeons studying lung illnesses and also kidney illnesses  all these branching systems  for which there was no geometry. So I found myself  in other words  constructing a geometry  a geometry of things which had no geometry. And a surprising aspect of it is that very often  the rules of this geometry are extremely short. You have formulas that long. And you crank it several times. Sometimes repeatedly  again  again  again  the same repetition. And at the end  you get things like that. This cloud is completely      percent artificial. Well    . . And the only part which is natural is a number  the roughness of the cloud  which is taken from nature. Something so complicated like a cloud  so unstable  so varying  should have a simple rule behind it. Now this simple rule is not an explanation of clouds. The seer of clouds had to take account of it. I don't know how much advanced these pictures are. They're old. I was very much involved in it  but then turned my attention to other phenomena. Now  here is another thing which is rather interesting. One of the shattering events in the history of mathematics  which is not appreciated by many people  occurred about     years ago      years ago. Mathematicians began to create shapes that didn't exist. Mathematicians got into self praise to an extent which was absolutely amazing  that man can invent things that nature did not know. In particular  it could invent things like a curve which fills the plane. A curve's a curve  a plane's a plane  and the two won't mix. Well  they do mix. A man named Peano did define such curves  and it became an object of extraordinary interest. It was very important  but mostly interesting because a kind of break  a separation between the mathematics coming from reality  on the one hand  and new mathematics coming from pure man's mind. Well  I was very sorry to point out that the pure man's mind has  in fact  seen at long last what had been seen for a long time. And so here I introduce something  the set of rivers of a plane filling curve. And well  it's a story unto itself. So it was in      to       an extraordinary period in which mathematics prepared itself to break out from the world. And the objects which were used as examples  when I was a child and a student  as examples of the break between mathematics and visible reality    those objects  I turned them completely around. I used them for describing some of the aspects of the complexity of nature. Well  a man named Hausdorff in      introduced a number which was just a mathematical joke  and I found that this number was a good measurement of roughness. When I first told it to my friends in mathematics they said   Don't be silly. It's just something  silly .  Well actually  I was not silly. The great painter Hokusai knew it very well. The things on the ground are algae. He did not know the mathematics  it didn't yet exist. And he was Japanese who had no contact with the West. But painting for a long time had a fractal side. I could speak of that for a long time. The Eiffel Tower has a fractal aspect. I read the book that Mr. Eiffel wrote about his tower  and indeed it was astonishing how much he understood. This is a mess  mess  mess  Brownian loop. One day I decided    halfway through my career  I was held by so many things in my work    I decided to test myself. Could I just look at something which everybody had been looking at for a long time and find something dramatically new  Well  so I looked at these things called Brownian motion    just goes around. I played with it for a while  and I made it return to the origin. Then I was telling my assistant   I don't see anything. Can you paint it   So he painted it  which means he put inside everything. He said   Well  this thing came out ...  And I said   Stop  Stop  Stop  I see  it's an island.  And amazing. So Brownian motion  which happens to have a roughness number of two  goes around. I measured it   .  . Again  again  again. Long measurements  big Brownian motions   .  . Mathematical problem  how to prove it  It took my friends    years. Three of them were having incomplete proofs. They got together  and together they had the proof. So they got the big  Fields  medal in mathematics  one of the three medals that people have received for proving things which I've seen without being able to prove them. Now everybody asks me at one point or another   How did it all start  What got you in that strange business   What got you to be  at the same time  a mechanical engineer  a geographer and a mathematician and so on  a physicist  Well actually I started  oddly enough  studying stock market prices. And so here I had this theory  and I wrote books about it    financial prices increments. To the left you see data over a long period. To the right  on top  you see a theory which is very  very fashionable. It was very easy  and you can write many books very fast about it. There are thousands of books on that. Now compare that with real price increments. Where are real price increments  Well  these other lines include some real price increments and some forgery which I did. So the idea there was that one must be able to    how do you say     model price variation. And it went really well    years ago. For    years  people were sort of pooh poohing me because they could do it much  much easier. But I tell you  at this point  people listened to me. These two curves are averages  Standard   Poor  the blue one  and the red one is Standard   Poor's from which the five biggest discontinuities are taken out. Now discontinuities are a nuisance  so in many studies of prices  one puts them aside.  Well  acts of God. And you have the little nonsense which is left. Acts of God.  In this picture  five acts of God are as important as everything else. In other words  it is not acts of God that we should put aside. That is the meat  the problem. If you master these  you master price  and if you don't master these  you can master the little noise as well as you can  but it's not important. Well  here are the curves for it. Now  I get to the final thing  which is the set of which my name is attached. In a way  it's the story of my life. My adolescence was spent during the German occupation of France. Since I thought that I might vanish within a day or a week  I had very big dreams. And after the war  I saw an uncle again. My uncle was a very prominent mathematician  and he told me   Look  there's a problem which I could not solve    years ago  and which nobody can solve. This is a construction of a man named  Gaston  Julia and  Pierre  Fatou. If you could find something new  anything  you will get your career made.  Very simple. So I looked  and like the thousands of people that had tried before  I found nothing. But then the computer came  and I decided to apply the computer  not to new problems in mathematics    like this wiggle wiggle  that's a new problem    but to old problems. And I went from what's called real numbers  which are points on a line  to imaginary  complex numbers  which are points on a plane  which is what one should do there  and this shape came out. This shape is of an extraordinary complication. The equation is hidden there  z goes into z squared  plus c. It's so simple  so dry. It's so uninteresting. Now you turn the crank once  twice  twice  marvels come out. I mean this comes out. I don't want to explain these things. This comes out. This comes out. Shapes which are of such complication  such harmony and such beauty. This comes out repeatedly  again  again  again. And that was one of my major discoveries  to find that these islands were the same as the whole big thing  more or less. And then you get these extraordinary baroque decorations all over the place. All that from this little formula  which has whatever  five symbols in it. And then this one. The color was added for two reasons. First of all  because these shapes are so complicated that one couldn't make any sense of the numbers. And if you plot them  you must choose some system. And so my principle has been to always present the shapes with different colorings because some colorings emphasize that  and others it is that or that. It's so complicated. In       I was in Cambridge  U.K. to receive a prize from the university  and three days later  a pilot was flying over the landscape and found this thing. So where did this come from  Obviously  from extraterrestrials. Well  so the newspaper in Cambridge published an article about that  discovery  and received the next day       letters from people saying   But that's simply a Mandelbrot set very big.  Well  let me finish. This shape here just came out of an exercise in pure mathematics. Bottomless wonders spring from simple rules  which are repeated without end. Thank you very much. I'm Ellen  and I'm totally obsessed with food. But I didn't start out obsessed with food. I started out obsessed with global security policy because I lived in New York during       and it was obviously a very relevant thing. And I got from global security policy to food because I realized when I'm hungry  I'm really pissed off  and I'm assuming that the rest of the world is too. Especially if you're hungry and your kids are hungry and your neighbor's kids are hungry and your whole neighborhood is hungry  you're pretty angry. And actually  lo and behold  it looks pretty much like the areas of the world that are hungry are also the areas of the world that are pretty insecure. So I took a job at the United Nations World Food Programme as a way to try to address these security issues through food security issues. And while I was there  I came across what I think is the most brilliant of their programs. It's called School Feeding  and it's a really simple idea to sort of get in the middle of the cycle of poverty and hunger that continues for a lot of people around the world  and stop it. By giving kids a free school meal  it gets them into school  which is obviously education  the first step out of poverty  but it also gives them the micronutrients and the macronutrients they need to really develop both mentally and physically. While I was working at the U.N.  I met this girl. Her name is Lauren Bush. And she had this really awesome idea to sell the bag called the  Feed Bag     which is really beautifully ironic because you can strap on the Feed Bag. But each bag we'd sell would provide a year's worth of school meals for one kid. It's so simple  and we thought  you know  okay  it costs between    and    bucks to provide school feeding for a year. We could sell these bags and raise a ton of money and a ton of awareness for the World Food Programme. But of course  you know at the U.N.  sometimes things move slowly  and they basically said no. And we thought  God  this is such a good idea and it's going to raise so much money. So we said screw it  we'll just start our own company  which we did three years ago. So that was kind of my first dream  was to start this company called FEED  and here's a screenshot of our website. We did this bag for Haiti  and we launched it just a month after the earthquake to provide school meals for kids in Haiti. So FEED's doing great. We've so far provided    million meals to kids around the world by selling now         bags  a ton of bags  a lot of bags. All this time you're    when you think about hunger  it's a hard thing to think about  because what we think about is eating. I think about eating a lot  and I really love it. And the thing that's a little strange about international hunger and talking about international issues is that most people kind of want to know   What are you doing in America    What are you doing for America's kids   There's definitely hunger in America     million people and almost   .  million children. I mean that's pretty dramatic for our own country. Hunger definitely means something a little bit different in America than it does internationally  but it's incredibly important to address hunger in our own country. But obviously the bigger problem that we all know about is obesity  and it's dramatic. The other thing that's dramatic is that both hunger and obesity have really risen in the last    years. Unfortunately  obesity's not only an American problem. It's actually been spreading all around the world and mainly through our kind of food systems that we're exporting. The numbers are pretty crazy. There's a billion people obese or overweight and a billion people hungry. So those seem like two bifurcated problems  but I kind of started to think about  you know  what is obesity and hunger  What are both those things about  Well  they're both about food. And when you think about food  the underpinning of food in both cases is potentially problematic agriculture. And agriculture is where food comes from. Well  agriculture in America's very interesting. It's very consolidated  and the foods that are produced lead to the foods that we eat. Well  the foods that are produced are  more or less  corn  soy and wheat. And as you can see  that's three quarters of the food that we're eating for the most part  processed foods and fast foods. Unfortunately  in our agricultural system  we haven't done a good job in the last three decades of exporting those technologies around the world. So African agriculture  which is the place of most hunger in the world  has actually fallen precipitously as hunger has risen. So somehow we're not making the connect between exporting a good agricultural system that will help feed people all around the world. Who is farming them  That's what I was wondering. So I went and stood on a big grain bin in the Midwest  and that really didn't help me understand farming  but I think it's a really cool picture. And you know  the reality is that between farmers in America  who actually  quite frankly  when I spend time in the Midwest  are pretty large in general. And their farms are also large. But farmers in the rest of the world are actually quite skinny  and that's because they're starving. Most hungry people in the world are subsistence farmers. And most of those people are women    which is a totally other topic that I won't get on right now  but I'd love to do the feminist thing at some point. I think it's really interesting to look at agriculture from these two sides. There's this large  consolidated farming that's led to what we eat in America  and it's really been since around       after the oil crisis  when  you know  mass consolidation  mass exodus of small farmers in this country. And then in the same time period  you know  we've kind of left Africa's farmers to do their own thing. Unfortunately  what is farmed ends up as what we eat. And in America  a lot of what we eat has led to obesity and has led to a real change in sort of what our diet is in the last    years. It's crazy. A fifth of kids under two drinks soda. Hello. You don't put soda in bottles. But people do because it's so cheap  and so our whole food system in the last    years has really shifted. I think  you know  it's not just in our own country  but really we're exporting the system around the world  and when you look at the data of least developed countries    especially in cities  which are growing really rapidly    people are eating American processed foods. And in one generation  they're going from hunger  and all of the detrimental health effects of hunger  to obesity and things like diabetes and heart disease in one generation. So the problematic food system is affecting both hunger and obesity. Not to beat a dead horse  but this is a global food system where there's a billion people hungry and billion people obese. I think that's the only way to look at it. And instead of taking these two things as bifurcated problems that are very separate  it's really important to look at them as one system. We get a lot of our food from all around the world  and people from all around the world are importing our food system  so it's incredibly relevant to start a new way of looking at it. The thing is  I've learned    and the technology people that are here  which I'm totally not one of them    but apparently  it really takes    years for a lot of technologies to become really endemic to us  like the mouse and the Internet and Windows. You know  there's    year cycles. I think      can be a really interesting year because it is the end of the    year cycle  and it's the birthday of the global food system. So that's the first birthday I want to talk about. You know  I think if we really think that this is something that's happened in the last    years  there's hope in that. It's the thirtieth anniversary of GMO crops and the Big Gulp  Chicken McNuggets  high fructose corn syrup  the farm crisis in America and the change in how we've addressed agriculture internationally. So there's a lot of reasons to take this    year time period as sort of the creation of this new food system. I'm not the only one who's obsessed with this whole    year thing. The icons like Michael Pollan and Jamie Oliver in his TED Prize wish both addressed this last three decade time period as incredibly relevant for food system change. Well  I really care about      because it's also the thirtieth anniversary of me this year. And so in my lifetime  a lot of what's happened in the world    and being a person obsessed with food    a lot of this has really changed. So my second dream is that I think we can look to the next    years as a time to change the food system again. And we know what's happened in the past  so if we start now  and we look at technologies and improvements to the food system long term  we might be able to recreate the food system so when I give my next talk and I'm    years old  I'll be able to say that it's been a success. So I'm announcing today the start of a new organization  or a new fund within the FEED Foundation  called the    Project. And the    Project is really focused on these long term ideas for food system change. And I think by aligning international advocates that are addressing hunger and domestic advocates that are addressing obesity  we might actually look for long term solutions that will make the food system better for everyone. We all tend to think that these systems are quite different  and people argue whether or not organic can feed the world  but if we take a    year view  there's more hope in collaborative ideas. So I'm hoping that by connecting really disparate organizations like the ONE campaign and Slow Food  which don't seem right now to have much in common  we can talk about holistic  long term  systemic solutions that will improve food for everyone. Some ideas I've had is like  look  the reality is    kids in the South Bronx need apples and carrots and so do kids in Botswana. And how are we going to get those kids those nutritious foods  Another thing that's become incredibly global is production of meat and fish. Understanding how to produce protein in a way that's healthy for the environment and healthy for people will be incredibly important to address things like climate change and how we use petrochemical fertilizers. And you know  these are really relevant topics that are long term and important for both people in Africa who are small farmers and people in America who are farmers and eaters. And I also think that thinking about processed foods in a new way  where we actually price the negative externalities like petrochemicals and like fertilizer runoff into the price of a bag of chips. Well  if that bag of chips then becomes inherently more expensive than an apple  then maybe it's time for a different sense of personal responsibility in food choice because the choices are actually choices instead of three quarters of the products being made just from corn  soy and wheat. The   Project.org is launched  and I've gathered a coalition of a few organizations to start. And it'll be growing over the next few months. But I really hope that you will all think of ways that you can look long term at things like the food system and make change. Trees epitomize stasis. Trees are rooted in the ground in one place for many human generations  but if we shift our perspective from the trunk to the twigs  trees become very dynamic entities  moving and growing. And I decided to explore this movement by turning trees into artists. I simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig. I waited for the wind to come up and held up a canvas  and that produced art. The piece of art you see on your left is painted by a western red cedar and that on your right by a Douglas fir  and what I learned was that different species have different signatures  like a Picasso versus a Monet. But I was also interested in the movement of trees and how this art might let me capture that and quantify it  so to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree    which produced this painting    moved in a single year  I simply measured and summed each of those lines. I multiplied them by the number of twigs per branch and the number of branches per tree and then divided that by the number of minutes per year. And so I was able to calculate how far a single tree moved in a single year. You might have a guess. The answer is actually         miles  or seven times around the globe. And so simply by shifting our perspective from a single trunk to the many dynamic twigs  we are able to see that trees are not simply static entities  but rather extremely dynamic. And I began to think about ways that we might consider this lesson of trees  to consider other entities that are also static and stuck  but which cry for change and dynamicism  and one of those entities is our prisons. Prisons  of course  are where people who break our laws are stuck  confined behind bars. And our prison system itself is stuck. The United States has over  .  million incarcerated men and women. That number is rising. Of the     incarcerated people that are released     will return to prison. Funds for education  for training and for rehabilitation are declining  so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues. I decided to ask whether the lesson I had learned from trees as artists could be applied to a static institution such as our prisons  and I think the answer is yes. In the year       I started a partnership with the Washington State Department of Corrections. Working with four prisons  we began bringing science and scientists  sustainability and conservation projects to four state prisons. We give science lectures  and the men here are choosing to come to our science lectures instead of watching television or weightlifting. That  I think  is movement. We partnered with the Nature Conservancy for inmates at Stafford Creek Correctional Center to grow endangered prairie plants for restoration of relic prairie areas in Washington state. That  I think  is movement. We worked with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife to grow endangered frogs    the Oregon spotted frog    for later release into protected wetlands. That  I think  is movement. And just recently  we've begun to work with those men who are segregated in what we call Supermax facilities. They've incurred violent infractions by becoming violent with guards and with other prisoners. They're kept in bare cells like this for    hours a day. When they have meetings with their review boards or mental health professionals  they're placed in immobile booths like this. For one hour a day they're brought to these bleak and bland exercise yards. Although we can't bring trees and prairie plants and frogs into these environments  we are bringing images of nature into these exercise yards  putting them on the walls  so at least they get contact with visual images of nature. This is Mr. Lopez  who has been in solitary confinement for    months  and he's providing input on the types of images that he believes would make him and his fellow inmates more serene  more calm  less apt to violence. And so what we see  I think  is that small  collective movements of change can perhaps move an entity such as our own prison system in a direction of hope. We know that trees are static entities when we look at their trunks. But if trees can create art  if they can encircle the globe seven times in one year  if prisoners can grow plants and raise frogs  then perhaps there are other static entities that we hold inside ourselves  like grief  like addictions  like racism  that can also change. Thank you very much. I still remember the day in school when our teacher told us that the world population had become three billion people  and that was in     . I'm going to talk now about how world population has changed from that year and into the future  but I will not use digital technology  as I've done during my first five TEDTalks. Instead  I have progressed  and I am  today  launching a brand new analog teaching technology that I picked up from IKEA  this box. This box contains one billion people. And our teacher told us that the industrialized world        had one billion people. In the developing world  she said  they had two billion people. And they lived away then. There was a big gap between the one billion in the industrialized world and the two billion in the developing world. In the industrialized world  people were healthy  educated  rich  and they had small families. And their aspiration was to buy a car. And in       all Swedes were saving to try to buy a Volvo like this. This was the economic level at which Sweden was. But in contrast to this  in the developing world  far away  the aspiration of the average family there was to have food for the day. They were saving to be able to buy a pair of shoes. There was an enormous gap in the world when I grew up. And this gap between the West and the rest has created a mindset of the world  which we still use linguistically when we talk about  the West  and  the Developing World.  But the world has changed  and it's overdue to upgrade that mindset and that taxonomy of the world  and to understand it. And that's what I'm going to show you  because since      what has happened in the world up to      is that a staggering four billion people have been added to the world population. Just look how many. The world population has doubled since I went to school. And of course  there's been economic growth in the West. A lot of companies have happened to grow the economy  so the Western population moved over to here. And now their aspiration is not only to have a car. Now they want to have a holiday on a very remote destination and they want to fly. So this is where they are today. And the most successful of the developing countries  they have moved on  you know  and they have become emerging economies  we call them. They are now buying cars. And what happened a month ago was that the Chinese company  Geely  they acquired the Volvo company  and then finally the Swedes understood that something big had happened in the world. So there they are. And the tragedy is that the two billion over here that is struggling for food and shoes  they are still almost as poor as they were    years ago. The new thing is that we have the biggest pile of billions  the three billions here  which are also becoming emerging economies  because they are quite healthy  relatively well educated  and they already also have two to three children per woman  as those  richer also  have. And their aspiration now is  of course  to buy a bicycle  and then later on they would like to have a motorbike also. But this is the world we have today  no longer any gap. But the distance from the poorest here  the very poorest  to the very richest over here is wider than ever. But there is a continuous world from walking  biking  driving  flying    there are people on all levels  and most people tend to be somewhere in the middle. This is the new world we have today in     . And what will happen in the future  Well  I'm going to project into     . I was in Shanghai recently  and I listened to what's happening in China  and it's pretty sure that they will catch up  just as Japan did. All the projections  say that  this one  billion  will  only  grow with one to two or three percent.  But this second  grows with seven  eight percent  and then they will end up here. They will start flying. And these lower or middle income countries  the emerging income countries  they will also forge forwards economically. And if  but only if  we invest in the right green technology    so that we can avoid severe climate change  and energy can still be relatively cheap    then they will move all the way up here. And they will start to buy electric cars. This is what we will find there. So what about the poorest two billion  What about the poorest two billion here  Will they move on  Well  here population  growth  comes in because there  among emerging economies  we already have two to three children per woman  family planning is widely used  and population growth is coming to an end. Here  among the poorest   population is growing. So these  poorest  two billion will  in the next decades  increase to three billion  and they will thereafter increase to four billion. There is nothing    but a nuclear war of a kind we've never seen    that can stop this  growth  from happening. Because we already have this  growth  in process. But if  and only if   the poorest  get out of poverty  they get education  they get improved child survival  they can buy a bicycle and a cell phone and come  to live  here  then population growth will stop in     . We cannot have people on this level looking for food and shoes because then we get continued population growth. And let me show you why by converting back to the old time digital technology. Here I have on the screen my country bubbles. Every bubble is a country. The size is population. The colors show the continent. The yellow on there is the Americas  dark blue is Africa  brown is Europe  green is the Middle East and this light blue is South Asia. That's India and this is China. Size is population. Here I have children per woman  two children  four children  six children  eight children    big families  small families. The year is     . And down here  child survival  the percentage of children surviving childhood up to starting school     percent     percent     percent      and almost     percent  as we have today in the wealthiest and healthiest countries. But look  this is the world my teacher talked about in       one billion Western world here    high child survival  small families    and all the rest  the rainbow of developing countries  with very large families and poor child survival. What has happened  I start the world. Here we go. Can you see  as the years pass by  child survival is increasing  They get soap  hygiene  education  vaccination  penicillin and then family planning. Family size is decreasing.  When  they get up to    percent child survival  then families decrease  and most of the Arab countries in the Middle East is falling down there  to small families . Look  Bangladesh catching up with India. The whole emerging world joins the Western world with good child survival and small family size  but we still have the poorest billion. Can you see the poorest billion  those  two  boxes I had over here  They are still up here. And they still have a child survival of only    to    percent  meaning that if you have six children born  there will be at least four who survive to the next generation. And the population will double in one generation. So the only way of really getting world population  growth  to stop is to continue to improve child survival to    percent. That's why investments by Gates Foundation  UNICEF and aid organizations  together with national government in the poorest countries  are so good  because they are actually helping us to reach a sustainable population size of the world. We can stop at nine billion if we do the right things. Child survival is the new green. It's only by child survival that we will stop population growth. And will it happen  Well  I'm not an optimist  neither am I a pessimist. I'm a very serious  possibilist.  It's a new category where we take emotion apart  and we just work analytically with the world. It can be done. We can have a much more just world. With green technology and with investments to alleviate poverty  and global governance  the world can become like this. And look at the position of the old West. Remember when this blue box was all alone  leading the world  living its own life. This will not happen  again . The role of the old West in the new world is to become the foundation of the modern world    nothing more  nothing less. But it's a very important role. Do it well and get used to it. Thank you very much. This is the ocean as I used to know it. And I find that since I've been in the Gulf a couple of times  I really kind of am traumatized because whenever I look at the ocean now  no matter where I am  even where I know none of the oil has gone  I sort of see slicks  and I'm finding that I'm very much haunted by it. But what I want to talk to you about today is a lot of things that try to put all of this in context  not just about the oil eruption  but what it means and why it has happened. First  just a little bit about me. I'm basically just a guy that likes to go fishing ever since I was a little kid  and because I did  I wound up studying sea birds to try to stay in the coastal habitats that I so loved. And now I mainly write books about how the ocean is changing  and the ocean is certainly changing very rapidly. Now we saw this kind of graphic earlier on  that we really live on a hard marble that has just a slight bit of wetness to it. It's like you dipped a marble in water. And the same thing with the atmosphere  If you took all the atmosphere and rolled it up in a ball  you would get that little sphere of gas on the right. So we live on the most fragile  little soap bubble you can imagine  a very sacred soap bubble  but one that is very  very easy to affect. And all the burning of oil and coal and gas  all the fossil fuels  have changed the atmosphere greatly. Carbon dioxide level has gone up and up and up. We're warming the climate. So the blowout in the Gulf is just a little piece of a much larger problem that we have with the energy that we use to run civilization. Beyond warming  we have the problem of the oceans getting more acidified    and already measurably so  and already affecting animals. Now in the laboratory  if you take a clam and you put it in the pH that is    not  .   which is the normal pH of seawater    but  .   it dissolves in about three days. If you take a sea urchin larva from  .   put it in a pH of  .     not a huge change    it becomes deformed and dies. And already  commercial oyster larvae are dying at large scales in some places. Coral reefs are growing slower in some places because of this problem. So this really matters. Now  let's take a little tour around the Gulf a little bit. One of the things that really impresses me about the people in the Gulf  They are really  really aquatic people. And they can handle water. They can handle a hurricane that comes and goes. When the water goes down  they know what to do. But when it's something other than water  and their water habitat changes  they don't have many options. In fact  those entire communities really don't have many options. They don't have another thing they can do. They can't go and work in the local hotel business because there isn't one in their community. If you go to the Gulf and you look around  you do see a lot of oil. You see a lot of oil on the ocean. You see a lot of oil on the shoreline. If you go to the site of the blowout  it looks pretty unbelievable. It looks like you just emptied the oil pan in your car  and you just dumped it in the ocean. And one of the really most incredible things  I think  is that there's nobody out there trying to collect it at the site where it is densest. Parts of the ocean there look just absolutely apocalyptic. You go in along the shore  you can find it everywhere. It's really messy. If you go to the places where it's just arriving  like the eastern part of the Gulf  in Alabama  there's still people using the beach while there are people cleaning up the beach. And they have a very strange way of cleaning up the beach. They're not allowed to put more than    pounds of sand in a    gallon plastic bag. They have thousands and thousands of plastic bags. I don't know what they're going to do with all that stuff. Meanwhile  there are still people trying to use the beach. They don't see the little  tiny sign that says   Stay out of the water.  Their kids are in the water  they're getting tar all over their clothes and their sandals. It's a mess. If you go to the place where the oil has been a while  it's an even bigger mess. And there's basically nobody there anymore  a few people trying to keep using it. You see people who are really shell shocked. They are very hardworking people. All they know about life is they get up in the morning  and if their engine starts  they go to work. They always felt that they could rely on the assurances that nature brought them through the ecosystem of the Gulf. They're finding that their world is really collapsing. And so you can see  literally  signs of their shock  signs of their outrage  signs of their anger  and signs of their grief. These are the things that you can see. There's a lot you can't see  also  underwater. What's going on underwater  Well  some people say there are oil plumes. Some people say there are not oil plumes. And Congressman Markey asks  you know   Is it going to take a submarine ride to see if there are really oil plumes   But I couldn't take a submarine ride    especially between the time I knew I was coming here and today    so I had to do a little experiment myself to see if there was oil in the Gulf of Mexico. So this is the Gulf of Mexico  sparkling place full of fish. I created a little oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. And I learned    in fact  I confirmed    the hypothesis that oil and water don't mix until you add a dispersant  and then they start mixing. And you add a little energy from the wind and the waves  and you get a big mess  a big mess that you can't possibly clean  you can't touch  you can't extract and  I think most importantly    this is what I think    you can't see it. I think it's being hidden on purpose. Now this is such a catastrophe and such a mess  that lots of stuff is leaking out on the edges of the information stream. But as many people have said  there's a large attempt to suppress what's going on. Personally  I think that the dispersants are a major strategy to hide the body  because we put the murderer in charge of the crime scene. But you can see it. You can see where the oil is concentrated at the surface  and then it is attacked  because they don't want the evidence  in my opinion. Okay. We heard that bacteria eat oil  So do sea turtles. When it breaks up  it has a long way to go before it gets down to bacteria. Turtles eat it. It gets in the gills of fish. These guys have to swim around through it. I heard the most incredible story today when I was on the train coming here. A writer named Ted Williams called me  and he was asking me a couple of questions about what I saw  because he's writing an article for Audubon magazine. He said that he had been in the Gulf a little while ago    like about a week ago    and a guy who had been a recreational fishing guide took him out to show him what's going on. That guide's entire calendar year is canceled bookings. He has no bookings left. Everybody wanted their deposit back. Everybody is fleeing. That's the story of thousands of people. But he told Ted that on the last day he went out  a bottlenose dolphin suddenly appeared next to the boat  and it was splattering oil out its blowhole. And he moved away because it was his last fishing trip  and he knew that the dolphins scare fish. So he moved away from it  turned around a few minutes later  it was right next to the side of the boat again. He said that in    years of fishing he had never seen a dolphin do that. And he felt that    he felt that it was coming to ask for help. Sorry. Now  in the Exxon Valdez spill  about    percent of the killer whales died in the first few months. Their numbers have never recovered. So the recovery rate of all this stuff is going to be variable. It's going to take longer for some things. And some things  I think  will probably come back a little faster. The other thing about the Gulf that is important is that there are a lot of animals that concentrate in the Gulf at certain parts of the year. So the Gulf is a really important piece of water    more important than a similar volume of water in the open Atlantic Ocean. These tuna swim the entire ocean. They get in the Gulf Stream. They go all the way to Europe. When it comes time to spawn  they come inside  and these two tuna that were tagged  you can see them on the spawning grounds very much right in the area of the slick. They're probably having  at the very least  a catastrophic spawning season this year. I'm hoping that maybe the adults are avoiding that dirty water. They don't usually like to go into water that is very cloudy anyway. But these are really high performance athletic animals. I don't know what this kind of stuff will do in their gills. I don't know if it'll affect the adults. If it's not  it's certainly affecting their eggs and larvae  I would certainly think. But if you look at that graph that goes down and down and down  that's what we've done to this species through overfishing over many decades. So while the oil spill  the leak  the eruption  is a catastrophe  I think it's important to keep in mind that we've done a lot to affect what's in the ocean for a very  very long time. It's not like we're starting with something that's been okay. We're starting with something that's had a lot of stresses and a lot of problems to begin with. If you look around at the birds  there are a lot of birds in the Gulf that concentrate in the Gulf at certain times of the year  but then leave. And they populate much larger areas. So for instance  most of the birds in this picture are migratory birds. They were all on the Gulf in May  while oil was starting to come ashore in certain places. Down on the lower left there are Ruddy Turnstones and Sanderlings. They breed in the high arctic  and they winter down in southern South America. But they concentrate in the Gulf and then fan out all across the arctic. I saw birds that breed in Greenland in the Gulf  so this is a hemispheric issue. The economic effects go at least nationally in many ways. The biological effects are certainly hemispheric. I think that this is one of the most absolutely mind boggling examples of total unpreparedness that I can even think of. Even when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor  at least they shot back. And we just seem to be unable to figure out what to do. There was nothing ready  and  you know  as we can see by what they're doing. Mainly what they're doing is booms and dispersants. The booms are absolutely not made for open water. They don't even attempt to corral the oil where it is most concentrated. They get near shore. Look at these two boats. That one on the right is called Fishing Fool. And I think  you know  that's a great name for boats that think that they're going to do anything to make a dent in this by dragging a boom between them when there are literally hundreds of thousands of square miles in the Gulf right now with oil at the surface. The dispersants make the oil go right under the booms. The booms are only about    inches in diameter. So it's just absolutely crazy. Here are shrimp boats employed. There are hundreds of shrimp boats employed to drag booms instead of nets. Here they are working. You can see easily that all the oily water just goes over the back of the boom. All they're doing is stirring it. It's just ridiculous. Also  for all the shoreline that has booms    hundreds and hundreds of miles of shoreline    all of the shoreline that has booms  there's adjacent shoreline that doesn't have any booms. There is ample opportunity for oil and dirty water to get in behind them. And that lower photo  that's a bird colony that has been boomed. Everybody's trying to protect the bird colonies there. Well  as an ornithologist  I can tell you that birds fly  and that    and that booming a bird colony doesn't do it  it doesn't do it. These birds make a living by diving into the water. In fact  really what I think they should do  if anything    they're trying so hard to protect those nests    actually  if they destroyed every single nest some of the birds would leave  and that would be better for them this year. As far as cleaning them  I don't mean to cast any aspersion on people cleaning birds. It's really  really important that we express our compassion. I think that's the most important thing that people have  is compassion. It's really important to get those images and to show it. But really  where are those birds going to get released to  It's like taking somebody out of a burning building  treating them for smoke inhalation and sending them back into the building  because the oil is still gushing. I refuse to acknowledge this as anything like an accident. I think that this is the result of gross negligence. Not just B.P. B.P. operated very sloppily and very recklessly because they could. And they were allowed to do so because of the absolute failure of oversight of the government that's supposed to be our government  protecting us. It turns out that    you see this sign on almost every commercial vessel in the United States    you know  if you spilled a couple of gallons of oil  you would be in big trouble. And you have to really wonder who are the laws made for  and who has gotten above the laws. Now there are things that we can do in the future. We could have the kinds of equipment that we would really need. It would not take an awful lot to anticipate that after making        holes in the sea floor of the Gulf of Mexico looking for oil  oil might start coming out of one of them. And you'd have some idea of what to do. That's certainly one of the things we need to do. But I think we have to understand where this leak really started from. It really started from the destruction of the idea that the government is there because it's our government  meant to protect the larger public interest. So I think that the oil blowout  the bank bailout  the mortgage crisis and all these things are absolutely symptoms of the same cause. We still seem to understand that at least we need the police to protect us from a few bad people. And even though the police can be a little annoying at times    giving us tickets and stuff like that    nobody says that we should just get rid of them. But in the entire rest of government right now and for the last at least    years  there has been a culture of deregulation that is caused directly by the people who we need to be protected from  buying the government out from under us. Now this has been a problem for a very  very long time. You can see that corporations were illegal at the founding of America  and even Thomas Jefferson complained that they were already bidding defiance to the laws of our country. Okay  people who say they're conservative  if they really wanted to be really conservative and really patriotic  they would tell these corporations to go to hell. That's what it would really mean to be conservative. So what we really need to do is regain the idea that it's our government safeguarding our interests and regain a sense of unity and common cause in our country that really has been lost. I think there are signs of hope. We seem to be waking up a little bit. The Glass Steagall Act    which was really to protect us from the kind of thing that caused the recession to happen  and the bank meltdown and all that stuff that required the bailouts    that was put in effect in       was systematically destroyed. Now there's a mood to put some of that stuff back in place  but the lobbyists are already there trying to weaken the regulations after the legislation has just passed. So it's a continued fight. It's a historic moment right now. We're either going to have an absolutely unmitigated catastrophe of this oil leak in the Gulf  or we will make the moment we need out of this  as many people have noted today. There's certainly a common theme about needing to make the moment out of this. We've been through this before with other ways of offshore drilling. The first offshore wells were called whales. The first offshore drills were called harpoons. We emptied the ocean of the whales at that time. Now are we stuck with this  Ever since we lived in caves  every time we wanted any energy  we lit something on fire  and that is still what we're doing. We're still lighting something on fire every time we want energy. And people say we can't have clean energy because it's too expensive. Who says it's too expensive  People who sell us fossil fuels. We've been here before with energy  and people saying the economy cannot withstand a switch  because the cheapest energy was slavery. Energy is always a moral issue. It's an issue that is moral right now. It's a matter of right and wrong. Thank you very much. When I was a student here in Oxford in the     s  the future of the world was bleak. The population explosion was unstoppable. Global famine was inevitable. A cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment was going to shorten our lives. The acid rain was falling on the forests. The desert was advancing by a mile or two a year. The oil was running out  and a nuclear winter would finish us off. None of those things happened  and astonishingly  if you look at what actually happened in my lifetime  the average per capita income of the average person on the planet  in real terms  adjusted for inflation  has tripled. Lifespan is up by    percent in my lifetime. Child mortality is down by two thirds. Per capita food production is up by a third. And all this at a time when the population has doubled. How did we achieve that  whether you think it's a good thing or not  How did we achieve that  How did we become the only species that becomes more prosperous as it becomes more populous  The size of the blob in this graph represents the size of the population  and the level of the graph represents GDP per capita. I think to answer that question you need to understand how human beings bring together their brains and enable their ideas to combine and recombine  to meet and  indeed  to mate. In other words  you need to understand how ideas have sex. I want you to imagine how we got from making objects like this to making objects like this. These are both real objects. One is an Acheulean hand axe from half a million years ago of the kind made by Homo erectus. The other is obviously a computer mouse. They're both exactly the same size and shape to an uncanny degree. I've tried to work out which is bigger  and it's almost impossible. And that's because they're both designed to fit the human hand. They're both technologies. In the end  their similarity is not that interesting. It just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand. The differences are what interest me  because the one on the left was made to a pretty unvarying design for about a million years    from one and a half million years ago to half a million years ago. Homo erectus made the same tool for        generations. Of course there were a few changes  but tools changed slower than skeletons in those days. There was no progress  no innovation. It's an extraordinary phenomenon  but it's true. Whereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years. And there's another difference too  which is the object on the left is made from one substance. The object on the right is made from a confection of different substances  from silicon and metal and plastic and so on. And more than that  it's a confection of different ideas  the idea of plastic  the idea of a laser  the idea of transistors. They've all been combined together in this technology. And it's this combination  this cumulative technology  that intrigues me  because I think it's the secret to understanding what's happening in the world. My body's an accumulation of ideas too  the idea of skin cells  the idea of brain cells  the idea of liver cells. They've come together. How does evolution do cumulative  combinatorial things  Well  it uses sexual reproduction. In an asexual species  if you get two different mutations in different creatures  a green one and a red one  then one has to be better than the other. One goes extinct for the other to survive. But if you have a sexual species  then it's possible for an individual to inherit both mutations from different lineages. So what sex does is it enables the individual to draw upon the genetic innovations of the whole species. It's not confined to its own lineage. What's the process that's having the same effect in cultural evolution as sex is having in biological evolution  And I think the answer is exchange  the habit of exchanging one thing for another. It's a unique human feature. No other animal does it. You can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange    and indeed there's reciprocity in other animals    But the exchange of one object for another never happens. As Adam Smith said   No man ever saw a dog make a fair exchange of a bone with another dog.  You can have culture without exchange. You can have  as it were  asexual culture. Chimpanzees  killer whales  these kinds of creatures  they have culture. They teach each other traditions which are handed down from parent to offspring. In this case  chimpanzees teaching each other how to crack nuts with rocks. But the difference is that these cultures never expand  never grow  never accumulate  never become combinatorial  and the reason is because there is no sex  as it were  there is no exchange of ideas. Chimpanzee troops have different cultures in different troops. There's no exchange of ideas between them. And why does exchange raise living standards  Well  the answer came from David Ricardo in     . And here is a Stone Age version of his story  although he told it in terms of trade between countries. Adam takes four hours to make a spear and three hours to make an axe. Oz takes one hour to make a spear and two hours to make an axe. So Oz is better at both spears and axes than Adam. He doesn't need Adam. He can make his own spears and axes. Well no  because if you think about it  if Oz makes two spears and Adam make two axes  and then they trade  then they will each have saved an hour of work. And the more they do this  the more true it's going to be  because the more they do this  the better Adam is going to get at making axes and the better Oz is going to get at making spears. So the gains from trade are only going to grow. And this is one of the beauties of exchange  is it actually creates the momentum for more specialization  which creates the momentum for more exchange and so on. Adam and Oz both saved an hour of time. That is prosperity  the saving of time in satisfying your needs. Ask yourself how long you would have to work to provide for yourself an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by. If you had to start from scratch  let's say you go out into the countryside. You find a sheep. You kill it. You get the fat out of it. You render it down. You make a candle  etc. etc. How long is it going to take you  Quite a long time. How long do you actually have to work to earn an hour of reading light if you're on the average wage in Britain today  And the answer is about half a second. Back in       you would have had to work for eight seconds on the average wage to acquire that much light. And that's seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you've gained since       as it were  because that's seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else  or you can acquire another good or service. And back in       it would have been    minutes to earn that amount of light on the average wage. Back in       you'd have had to work six hours to earn a candle that could burn for an hour. In other words  the average person on the average wage could not afford a candle in     . Go back to this image of the axe and the mouse  and ask yourself   Who made them and for who   The stone axe was made by someone for himself. It was self sufficiency. We call that poverty these days. But the object on the right was made for me by other people. How many other people  Tens  Hundreds  Thousands  You know  I think it's probably millions. Because you've got to include the man who grew the coffee  which was brewed for the man who was on the oil rig  who was drilling for oil  which was going to be made into the plastic  etc. They were all working for me  to make a mouse for me. And that's the way society works. That's what we've achieved as a species. In the old days  if you were rich  you literally had people working for you. That's how you got to be rich  you employed them. Louis XIV had a lot of people working for him. They made his silly outfits  like this  and they did his silly hairstyles  or whatever. He had     people to prepare his dinner every night. But a modern tourist going around the palace of Versailles and looking at Louis XIV's pictures  he has     people doing his dinner tonight too. They're in bistros and cafes and restaurants and shops all over Paris  and they're all ready to serve you at an hour's notice with an excellent meal that's probably got higher quality than Louis XIV even had. And that's what we've done  because we're all working for each other. We're able to draw upon specialization and exchange to raise each other's living standards. Now  you do get other animals working for each other too. Ants are a classic example  workers work for queens and queens work for workers. But there's a big difference  which is that it only happens within the colony. There's no working for each other across the colonies. And the reason for that is because there's a reproductive division of labor. That is to say  they specialize with respect to reproduction. The queen does it all. In our species  we don't like doing that. It's the one thing we insist on doing for ourselves  is reproduction. Even in England  we don't leave reproduction to the Queen. So when did this habit start  And how long has it been going on  And what does it mean  Well  I think  probably  the oldest version of this is probably the sexual division of labor. But I've got no evidence for that. It just looks like the first thing we did was work male for female and female for male. In all hunter gatherer societies today  there's a foraging division of labor between  on the whole  hunting males and gathering females. It isn't always quite that simple  but there's a distinction between specialized roles for males and females. And the beauty of this system is that it benefits both sides. The woman knows that  in the Hadzas' case here    digging roots to share with men in exchange for meat    she knows that all she has to do to get access to protein is to dig some extra roots and trade them for meat. And she doesn't have to go on an exhausting hunt and try and kill a warthog. And the man knows that he doesn't have to do any digging to get roots. All he has to do is make sure that when he kills a warthog it's big enough to share some. And so both sides raise each other's standards of living through the sexual division of labor. When did this happen  We don't know  but it's possible that Neanderthals didn't do this. They were a highly cooperative species. They were a highly intelligent species. Their brains on average  by the end  were bigger than yours and mine in this room today. They were imaginative. They buried their dead. They had language  probably  because we know they had the FOXP  gene of the same kind as us  which was discovered here in Oxford. And so it looks like they probably had linguistic skills. They were brilliant people. I'm not dissing the Neanderthals. But there's no evidence of a sexual division of labor. There's no evidence of gathering behavior by females. It looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men. And the other thing there's no evidence for is exchange between groups  because the objects that you find in Neanderthal remains  the tools they made  are always made from local materials. For example  in the Caucasus there's a site where you find local Neanderthal tools. They're always made from local chert. In the same valley there are modern human remains from about the same date         years ago  and some of those are from local chert  but more    but many of them are made from obsidian from a long way away. And when human beings began moving objects around like this  it was evidence that they were exchanging between groups. Trade is    times as old as farming. People forget that. People think of trade as a modern thing. Exchange between groups has been going on for a hundred thousand years. And the earliest evidence for it crops up somewhere between    and         years ago in Africa  when you see obsidian and jasper and other things moving long distances in Ethiopia. You also see seashells    as discovered by a team here in Oxford    moving     miles inland from the Mediterranean in Algeria. And that's evidence that people have started exchanging between groups. And that will have led to specialization. How do you know that long distance movement means trade rather than migration  Well  you look at modern hunter gatherers like aboriginals  who quarried for stone axes at a place called Mount Isa  which was a quarry owned by the Kalkadoon tribe. They traded them with their neighbors for things like stingray barbs  and the consequence was that stone axes ended up over a large part of Australia. So long distance movement of tools is a sign of trade  not migration. What happens when you cut people off from exchange  from the ability to exchange and specialize  And the answer is that not only do you slow down technological progress  you can actually throw it into reverse. An example is Tasmania. When the sea level rose and Tasmania became an island        years ago  the people on it not only experienced slower progress than people on the mainland  they actually experienced regress. They gave up the ability to make stone tools and fishing equipment and clothing because the population of about       people was simply not large enough to maintain the specialized skills necessary to keep the technology they had. It's as if the people in this room were plonked on a desert island. How many of the things in our pockets could we continue to make after        years  It didn't happen in Tierra del Fuego    similar island  similar people. The reason  because Tierra del Fuego is separated from South America by a much narrower straight  and there was trading contact across that straight throughout        years. The Tasmanians were isolated. Go back to this image again and ask yourself  not only who made it and for who  but who knew how to make it. In the case of the stone axe  the man who made it knew how to make it. But who knows how to make a computer mouse  Nobody  literally nobody. There is nobody on the planet who knows how to make a computer mouse. I mean this quite seriously. The president of the computer mouse company doesn't know. He just knows how to run a company. The person on the assembly line doesn't know because he doesn't know how to drill an oil well to get oil out to make plastic  and so on. We all know little bits  but none of us knows the whole. I am of course quoting from a famous essay by Leonard Read  the economist in the     s  called  I  Pencil  in which he wrote about how a pencil came to be made  and how nobody knows even how to make a pencil  because the people who assemble it don't know how to mine graphite  and they don't know how to fell trees and that kind of thing. And what we've done in human society  through exchange and specialization  is we've created the ability to do things that we don't even understand. It's not the same with language. With language we have to transfer ideas that we understand with each other. But with technology  we can actually do things that are beyond our capabilities. We've gone beyond the capacity of the human mind to an extraordinary degree. And by the way  that's one of the reasons that I'm not interested in the debate about I.Q.  about whether some groups have higher I.Q.s than other groups. It's completely irrelevant. What's relevant to a society is how well people are communicating their ideas  and how well they're cooperating  not how clever the individuals are. So we've created something called the collective brain. We're just the nodes in the network. We're the neurons in this brain. It's the interchange of ideas  the meeting and mating of ideas between them  that is causing technological progress  incrementally  bit by bit. However  bad things happen. And in the future  as we go forward  we will  of course  experience terrible things. There will be wars  there will be depressions  there will be natural disasters. Awful things will happen in this century  I'm absolutely sure. But I'm also sure that  because of the connections people are making  and the ability of ideas to meet and to mate as never before  I'm also sure that technology will advance  and therefore living standards will advance. Because through the cloud  through crowd sourcing  through the bottom up world that we've created  where not just the elites but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them meet and mate  we are surely accelerating the rate of innovation. Thank you. I'm an American  which means  generally  I ignore football unless it involves guys my size or Bruno's size running into each other at extremely high speeds. That said  it's been really hard to ignore football for the last couple of weeks. I go onto Twitter  there are all these strange words that I've never heard before  FIFA  vuvuzela  weird jokes about octopi. But the one that's really been sort of stressing me out  that I haven't been able to figure out  is this phrase  Cala a boca  Galvao.  If you've gone onto Twitter in the last couple of weeks  you've probably seen this. It's been a major trending topic. Being a monolingual American  I obviously don't know what the phrase means. So I went onto Twitter  and I asked some people if they could explain to me  Cala a boca  Galvao.  And fortunately  my Brazilian friends were more than ready to help. They explained that the Galvao bird is a rare and endangered parrot that's in terrible  terrible danger. In fact  I'll let them tell you a bit more about it. Narrator  A word about Galvao  a very rare kind of bird native to Brazil. Every year  more than         Galvao birds are killed during Carnival parades. Ethan Zuckerman  Obviously  this is a tragic situation  and it actually gets worse. It turns out that  not only is the Galvao parrot very attractive  useful for headdresses  it evidently has certain hallucinogenic properties  which means that there's a terrible problem with Galvao abuse. Some sick and twisted people have found themselves snorting Galvao. And it's terribly endangered. The good news about this is that the global community    again  my Brazilian friends tell me    is pitching in to help out. It turns out that Lady Gaga has released a new single    actually five or six new singles  as near as I can tell    titled  Cala a boca  Galvao.  And my Brazilian friends tell me that if I just tweet the phrase  Cala a boca  Galvao      cents will be given to a global campaign to save this rare and beautiful bird. Now  most of you have figured out that this was a prank  and actually a very  very good one.  Cala a boca  Galvao  actually means something very different. In Portugese  it means  Shut your mouth  Galvao.  And it specifically refers to this guy  Galvao Bueno  who's the lead soccer commentator for Rede Globo. And what I understand from my Brazilian friends is that this guy is just a cliche machine. He can ruin the most interesting match by just spouting cliche again and again and again. So Brazilians went to that first match against North Korea  put up this banner  started a Twitter campaign and tried to convince the rest of us to tweet the phrase   Cala a boca  Galvao.  And in fact  were so successful at this that it topped Twitter for two weeks. Now there's a couple    there's a couple of lessons that you can take from this. And the first lesson  which I think is a worthwhile one  is that you cannot go wrong asking people to be active online  so long as activism just means retweeting a phrase. So as long as activism is that simple  it's pretty easy to get away with. The other thing you can take from this  by the way  is that there are a lot of Brazilians on Twitter. There's more than five million of them. As far as national representation     percent of Brazilian internet users are on Twitter. That's a much higher number than in the U.S. or U.K. Next to Japan  it's the second most represented by population. Now if you're using Twitter or other social networks  and you didn't realize this was a space with a lot of Brazilians in it  you're like most of us. Because what happens on a social network is you interact with the people that you have chosen to interact with. And if you are like me  a big  geeky  white  American guy  you tend to interact with a lot of other geeky  white  American guys. And you don't necessarily have the sense that Twitter is in fact a very heavily Brazilian space. It's also extremely surprising to many Americans  a heavily African American space. Twitter recently did some research. They looked at their local population. They believe that    percent of American Twitter users are African American. That's about twice as high as African Americans are represented in the population. And again  that was very shocking to many Twitter users  but it shouldn't be. And the reason it shouldn't be is that on any day you can go into Trending Topics. And you tend to find topics that are almost entirely African American conversations. This was a visualization done by Fernando Viegas and Martin Wattenberg  two amazing visualization designers  who looked at a weekend's worth of Twitter traffic and essentially found that a lot of these trending topics were basically segregated conversations    and in ways that you wouldn't expect. It turns out that oil spill is a mostly white conversation  that cookout is a mostly black conversation. And what's crazy about this is that if you wanted to mix up who you were seeing on Twitter  it's literally a quick click away. You click on that cookout tag  there an entirely different conversation with different people participating in it. But generally speaking  most of us don't. We end up within these filter bubbles  as my friend Eli Pariser calls them  where we see the people we already know and the people who are similar to the people we already know. And we tend not to see that wider picture. Now for me  I'm surprised by this  because this wasn't how the internet was supposed to be. If you go back into the early days of the internet  when cyber utopians like Nick Negroponte were writing big books like  Being Digital   the prediction was that the internet was going to be an incredibly powerful force to smooth out cultural differences  to put us all on a common field of one fashion or another. Negroponte started his book with a story about how hard it is to build connections in the world of atoms. He's at a technology conference in Florida. And he's looking at something really  truly absurd  which is bottles of Evian water on the table. And Negroponte says this is crazy. This is the old economy. It's the economy of moving these heavy  slow atoms over long distances that's very difficult to do. We're heading to the future of bits  where everything is speedy  it's weightless. It can be anywhere in the world at any time. And it's going to change the world as we know it. Now  Negroponte has been right about a lot of things. He's totally wrong about this one. It turns out that in many cases atoms are much more mobile than bits. If I walk into a store in the United States  it's very  very easy for me to buy water that's bottled in Fiji  shipped at great expense to the United States. It's actually surprisingly hard for me to see a Fijian feature film. It's really difficult for me to listen to Fijian music. It's extremely difficult for me to get Fijian news  which is strange  because actually there's an enormous amount going on in Fiji. There's a coup government. There's a military government. There's crackdowns on the press. It's actually a place that we probably should be paying attention to at the moment. Here's what I think is going on. I think that we tend to look a lot at the infrastructure of globalization. We look at the framework that makes it possible to live in this connected world. And that's a framework that includes things like airline routes. It includes things like the Internet cables. We look at a map like this one  and it looks like the entire world is flat because everything is a hop or two away. You can get on a flight in London  you can end up in Bangalore later today. Two hops  you're in Suva  the capitol of Fiji. It's all right there. When you start looking at what actually flows on top of these networks  you get a very different picture. You start looking at how the global plane flights move  and you suddenly discover that the world isn't even close to flat. It's extremely lumpy. There are parts of the world that are very  very well connected. There's basically a giant pathway in the sky between London and New York. but look at this map  and you can watch this for  you know  two or three minutes. You won't see very many planes go from South America to Africa. And you'll discover that there are parts of the globe that are systematically cut off. When we stop looking at the infrastructure that makes connection possible  and we look at what actually happens  we start realizing that the world doesn't work quite the same way that we think it does. So here's the problem that I've been interested in in the last decade or so. The world is  in fact  getting more global. It's getting more connected. More of problems are global in scale. More of our economics is global in scale. And our media is less global by the day. If you watched a television broadcast in the United States in the     s     to    percent of it would have been international news on a nightly new broadcast. That's down to about    to    percent. And this tends to give us a very distorted view of the world. Here's a slide that Alisa Miller showed at a previous TED Talk. Alisa's the president of Public Radio International. And she made a cartogram  which is basically a distorted map based on what American television news casts looked at for a month. And you see that when you distort a map based on attention  the world within American television news is basically reduced to this giant bloated U.S. and a couple of other countries which we've invaded. And that's basically what our media is about. And before you conclude that this is just a function of American TV news    which is dreadful  and I agree that it's dreadful    I've been mapping elite media like the New York Times  and I get the same thing. When you look at the New York Times  you look at other elite media  what you largely get are pictures of very wealthy nations and the nations we've invaded. It turns out that new media isn't necessarily helping us all that much. Here's a map made by Mark Graham who's down the street at the Oxford Internet Institute. A this is a map of articles in Wikipedia that have been geo coded. And you'll notice that there's a very heavy bias towards North America and Western Europe. Even within Wikipedias  where we're creating their own content online  there's a heavy bias towards the place where a lot of the Wikipedia authors are based  rather than to the rest of the world. In the U.K.  you can get up  you can pick up your computer when you get out of this session  you could read a newspaper from India or from Australia  from Canada  God forbid from the U.S. You probably won't. If you look at online media consumption    in this case  in the top    users of the internet    more than    percent of the news readership is on domestic news sites. It's one of these rare cases where the U.S. is actually slightly better than  the U.K.   because we actually like reading your media  rather than vice versa. So all of this starts leading me to think that we're in a state that I refer to as imaginary cosmopolitanism. We look at the internet. We think we're getting this wide view of the globe. We occasionally stumble onto a page in Chinese  and we decide that we do in fact have the greatest technology ever built to connect us to the rest of the world. And we forget that most of the time we're checking Boston Red Sox scores. So this is a real problem    not just because the Red Sox are having a bad year    but it's a real problem because  as we're discussing here at TED  the real problems in the world the interesting problems to solve are global in scale and scope  they require global conversations to get to global solutions. This is a problem we have to solve. So here's the good news. For six years  I've been hanging out with these guys. This is a group called Global Voices. This is a team of bloggers from around the world. Our mission was to fix the world's media. We started in     . You might have noticed  we haven't done all that well so far. Nor do I think we are by ourselves  actually going to solve the problem. But the more that I think about it  the more that I think that a few things that we have learned along the way are interesting lessons for how we would rewire if we we wanted to use the web to have a wider world. The first thing you have to consider is that there are parts of the world that are dark spots in terms of attention. In this case    the map of the world at night by NASA    they're dark literally because of lack of electricity. And I used to think that a dark spot on this map basically meant you're not going to get media from there because there are more basic needs. What I'm starting to realize is that you can get media  it's just an enormous amount of work  and you need an enormous amount of encouragement. One of those dark spots is Madagascar  a country which is generally better known for the Dreamworks film than it is actually known for the lovely people who live there. And so the people who founded Foko Club in Madagascar weren't actually concerned with trying to change the image of their country. They were doing something much simpler. It was a club to learn English and to learn computers and the internet. but what happened was that Madagascar went through a violent coup. Most independent media was shut down. And the high school students who were learning to blog through Foko Club suddenly found themselves talking to an international audience about the demonstrations  the violence  everything that was going on within this country. So a very  very small program designed to get people in front of computers  publishing their own thoughts  publishing independent media  ended up having a huge impact on what we know about this country. Now the trick with this is that I'm guessing most people here don't speak Malagasy. I'm also guessing that most of you don't even speak Chinese    which is sort of sad if you think about it  as it's now the most represented language on the internet. Fortunately people are trying to figure out how to fix this. If you're using Google Chrome and you go to a Chinese language site  you notice this really cute box at the top  which automatically detects that the page is in Chinese and very quickly at a mouse click will give you a translation of the page. Unfortunately  it's a machine translation of the page. And while Google is very  very good with some languages  it's actually pretty dreadful with Chinese. And the results can be pretty funny. What you really want    what I really want  is eventually the ability to push a button and have this queued so a human being can translate this. And if you think this is absurd  it's not. There's a group right now in China called Yeeyan. And Yeeyan is a group of         volunteers who get online every day. They look for the most interesting content in the English language. They translate roughly     articles a day from major newspapers  major websites. They put it online for free. It's the project of a guy named Zhang Lei  who was living in the United States during the Lhasa riots and who couldn't believe how biased American media coverage was. And he said   If there's one thing I can do  I can start translating  so that people between these countries start understanding each other a little bit better.  And my question to you is  if Yeeyan can line up         people to translate the English internet into Chinese  where's the English language Yeeyan  Who's going after Chinese  which now has     million internet users out there  My guess is at least one of them has something interesting to say. So even if we can find a way to translate from Chinese  there's no guarantee that we're going to find it. When we look for information online  we basically have two strategies. We use a lot of search. And search is terrific if you know what you're looking for. But if what you're looking for is serendipity  if you want to stumble onto something that you didn't know you needed  our main philosophy is to look to our social networks  to look for our friends. What are they looking at  Maybe we should be looking at it. The problem with this is that essentially what you end up getting after a while is the wisdom of the flock. You end up flocking with a lot of people who are probably similar to you  who have similar interests. And it's very  very hard to get information from the other flocks  from the other parts of the world where people getting together and talking about their own interests. To do this  at a certain point  you need someone to bump you out of your flock and into another flock. You need a guide. So this is Amira Al Hussaini. She is the Middle East editor for Global Voices. She has one of the hardest jobs in the world. Not only does she have to keep our Israeli and Palestinian contributors from killing each other  she has to figure out what is going to interest you about the Middle East. And in that sense of trying to get you out of your normal orbit  and to try to get you to pay attention to a story about someone who's given up smoking for the month of Ramadan  she has to know something about a global audience. She has to know something about what stories are available. Basically  she's a deejay. She's a skilled human curator who knows what material is available to her  who's able to listen to the audience  and who's able to make a selection and push people forward in one fashion or another. I don't think this is necessarily an algorithmic process. I think what's great about the internet is that it actually makes it much easier for deejays to reach a wider audience. I know Amira. I can ask her what to read. But with the internet  she's in a position where she can tell a lot of people what to read. And you can listen to her as well  if this is a way that you're interested in having your web widened. So once you start widening like this  once you start lighting up voices in the dark spots  once you start translating  once you start curating  you end up in some really weird places. This is an image from pretty much my favorite blog  which is AfriGadget. And AfriGadget is a blog that looks at technology in an Africa context. And specifically  it's looking at a blacksmith in Kibera in Nairobi  who is turning the shaft of a Landrover into a cold chisel. And when you look at this image  you might find yourself going   Why would I conceivably care about this   And the truth is  this guy can probably explain this to you. This is Erik Hersman. You guys may have seen him around the conference. He goes by the moniker White African. He's both a very well known American geek  but he's also Kenyan  he was born in Sudan  grew up in Kenya. He is a bridge figure. He is someone who literally has feet in both worlds    one in the world of the African technology community  one in the world of the American technology community. And so he's able to tell a story about this blacksmith in Kibera and turn it into a story about repurposing technology  about innovating from constraint  about looking for inspiration based on reusing materials. He knows one world  and he's finding a way to communicate it to another world  both of which he has deep connections to. These bridge figures  I'm pretty well convinced  are the future of how we try to make the world wider through using the web. But the trick with bridges is  ultimately  you need someone to cross them. And that's where we start talking about xenophiles. So if I found myself in the NFL  I suspect I would spend my off season nursing my wounds  enjoying my house  so on and so forth    possibly recording a hip hop album. Dhani Jones  who is the middle linebacker for the Cincinnati Bengals  has a slightly different approach to the off season. Dhani has a television show. It's called  Dhani Tackles the Globe.  And every week on this television show  Dhani travels to a different nation of the world. He finds a local sporting team. He trains with them for a week  and he plays a match with them. And his reason for this is not just that he wants to master Muay Thai boxing. It's because  for him  sport is the language that allows him to encounter the full width and wonder of the world. For some of us it might be music. For some of us it might be food. For a lot of us it might be literature or writing. But there are all these different techniques that allow you to go out and look at the world and find your place within it. The goal of my Talk here is not to persuade the people in this room to embrace your xenophilia. My guess    given that you're at a conference called TEDGlobal    is that most of you are xenophiles  whether or not you use that term. My challenge instead is this. It's not enough to make the personal decision that you want a wider world. We have to figure out how to rewire the systems that we have. We have to fix our media. We have to fix the internet. We have to fix our education. We have to fix our immigration policy. We need to look at ways of creating serendipity  of making translation pervasive  and we need to find ways to embrace and celebrate these bridge figures. And we need to figure out how to cultivate xenophiles. That's what I'm trying to do. I need your help. I'm a storyteller. That's what I do in life    telling stories  writing novels    and today I would like to tell you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also some supernatural creatures called the djinni. But before I go there  please allow me to share with you glimpses of my personal story. I will do so with the help of words  of course  but also a geometrical shape  the circle  so throughout my talk  you will come across several circles. I was born in Strasbourg  France to Turkish parents. Shortly after  my parents got separated  and I came to Turkey with my mom. From then on  I was raised as a single child by a single mother. Now in the early     s  in Ankara  that was a bit unusual. Our neighborhood was full of large families  where fathers were the heads of households  so I grew up seeing my mother as a divorcee in a patriarchal environment. In fact  I grew up observing two different kinds of womanhood. On the one hand was my mother  a well educated  secular  modern  westernized  Turkish woman. On the other hand was my grandmother  who also took care of me and was more spiritual  less educated and definitely less rational. This was a woman who read coffee grounds to see the future and melted lead into mysterious shapes to fend off the evil eye. Many people visited my grandmother  people with severe acne on their faces or warts on their hands. Each time  my grandmother would utter some words in Arabic  take a red apple and stab it with as many rose thorns as the number of warts she wanted to remove. Then one by one  she would encircle these thorns with dark ink. A week later  the patient would come back for a follow up examination. Now  I'm aware that I should not be saying such things in front of an audience of scholars and scientists  but the truth is  of all the people who visited my grandmother for their skin conditions  I did not see anyone go back unhappy or unhealed. I asked her how she did this. Was it the power of praying  In response she said   Yes  praying is effective  but also beware of the power of circles.  From her  I learned  amongst many other things  one very precious lesson    that if you want to destroy something in this life  be it an acne  a blemish or the human soul  all you need to do is to surround it with thick walls. It will dry up inside. Now we all live in some kind of a social and cultural circle. We all do. We're born into a certain family  nation  class. But if we have no connection whatsoever with the worlds beyond the one we take for granted  then we too run the risk of drying up inside. Our imagination might shrink  our hearts might dwindle  and our humanness might wither if we stay for too long inside our cultural cocoons. Our friends  neighbors  colleagues  family    if all the people in our inner circle resemble us  it means we are surrounded with our mirror image. Now one other thing women like my grandma do in Turkey is to cover mirrors with velvet or to hang them on the walls with their backs facing out. It's an old Eastern tradition based on the knowledge that it's not healthy for a human being to spend too much time staring at his own reflection. Ironically   living in  communities of the like minded is one of the greatest dangers of today's globalized world. And it's happening everywhere  among liberals and conservatives  agnostics and believers  the rich and the poor  East and West alike. We tend to form clusters based on similarity  and then we produce stereotypes about other clusters of people. In my opinion  one way of transcending these cultural ghettos is through the art of storytelling. Stories cannot demolish frontiers  but they can punch holes in our mental walls. And through those holes  we can get a glimpse of the other  and sometimes even like what we see. I started writing fiction at the age of eight. My mother came home one day with a turquoise notebook and asked me if I'd be interested in keeping a personal journal. In retrospect  I think she was slightly worried about my sanity. I was constantly telling stories at home  which was good  except I told this to imaginary friends around me  which was not so good. I was an introverted child  to the point of communicating with colored crayons and apologizing to objects when I bumped into them  so my mother thought it might do me good to write down my day to day experiences and emotions. What she didn't know was that I thought my life was terribly boring  and the last thing I wanted to do was to write about myself. Instead  I began to write about people other than me and things that never really happened. And thus began my life long passion for writing fiction. So from the very beginning  fiction for me was less of an autobiographical manifestation than a transcendental journey into other lives  other possibilities. And please bear with me  I'll draw a circle and come back to this point. Now one other thing happened around this same time. My mother became a diplomat. So from this small  superstitious  middle class neighborhood of my grandmother  I was zoomed into this posh  international school  in Madrid   where I was the only Turk. It was here that I had my first encounter with what I call the  representative foreigner.  In our classroom  there were children from all nationalities  yet this diversity did not necessarily lead to a cosmopolitan  egalitarian classroom democracy. Instead  it generated an atmosphere in which each child was seen    not as an individual on his own  but as the representative of something larger. We were like a miniature United Nations  which was fun  except whenever something negative  with regards to a nation or a religion  took place. The child who represented it was mocked  ridiculed and bullied endlessly. And I should know  because during the time I attended that school  a military takeover happened in my country  a gunman of my nationality nearly killed the Pope  and Turkey got zero points in  the  Eurovision Song Contest. I skipped school often and dreamed of becoming a sailor during those days. I also had my first taste of cultural stereotypes there. The other children asked me about the movie  Midnight Express   which I had not seen  they inquired how many cigarettes a day I smoked  because they thought all Turks were heavy smokers  and they wondered at what age I would start covering my hair. I came to learn that these were the three main stereotypes about my country  politics  cigarettes and the veil. After Spain  we went to Jordan  Germany and Ankara again. Everywhere I went  I felt like my imagination was the only suitcase I could take with me. Stories gave me a sense of center  continuity and coherence  the three big Cs that I otherwise lacked. In my mid twenties  I moved to Istanbul  the city I adore. I lived in a very vibrant  diverse neighborhood where I wrote several of my novels. I was in Istanbul when the earthquake hit in     . When I ran out of the building at three in the morning  I saw something that stopped me in my tracks. There was the local grocer there    a grumpy  old man who didn't sell alcohol and didn't speak to marginals. He was sitting next to a transvestite with a long black wig and mascara running down her cheeks. I watched the man open a pack of cigarettes with trembling hands and offer one to her  and that is the image of the night of the earthquake in my mind today    a conservative grocer and a crying transvestite smoking together on the sidewalk. In the face of death and destruction  our mundane differences evaporated  and we all became one even if for a few hours. But I've always believed that stories  too  have a similar effect on us. I'm not saying that fiction has the magnitude of an earthquake  but when we are reading a good novel  we leave our small  cozy apartments behind  go out into the night alone and start getting to know people we had never met before and perhaps had even been biased against. Shortly after  I went to a women's college in Boston  then Michigan. I experienced this  not so much as a geographical shift  as a linguistic one. I started writing fiction in English. I'm not an immigrant  refugee or exile    they ask me why I do this    but the commute between languages gives me the chance to recreate myself. I love writing in Turkish  which to me is very poetic and very emotional  and I love writing in English  which to me is very mathematical and cerebral. So I feel connected to each language in a different way. For me  like millions of other people around the world today  English is an acquired language. When you're a latecomer to a language  what happens is you live there with a continuous and perpetual frustration. As latecomers  we always want to say more  you know  crack better jokes  say better things  but we end up saying less because there's a gap between the mind and the tongue. And that gap is very intimidating. But if we manage not to be frightened by it  it's also stimulating. And this is what I discovered in Boston    that frustration was very stimulating. At this stage  my grandmother  who had been watching the course of my life with increasing anxiety  started to include in her daily prayers that I urgently get married so that I could settle down once and for all. And because God loves her  I did get married. But instead of settling down  I went to Arizona. And since my husband is in Istanbul  I started commuting between Arizona and Istanbul    the two places on the surface of earth that couldn't be more different. I guess one part of me has always been a nomad  physically and spiritually. Stories accompany me  keeping my pieces and memories together  like an existential glue. Yet as much as I love stories  recently  I've also begun to think that they lose their magic if and when a story is seen as more than a story. And this is a subject that I would love to think about together. When my first novel written in English came out in America  I heard an interesting remark from a literary critic.  I liked your book   he said   but I wish you had written it differently.  I asked him what he meant by that. He said   Well  look at it. There's so many Spanish  American  Hispanic characters in it  but there's only one Turkish character and it's a man.  Now the novel took place on a university campus in Boston  so to me  it was normal that there be more international characters in it than Turkish characters  but I understood what my critic was looking for. And I also understood that I would keep disappointing him. He wanted to see the manifestation of my identity. He was looking for a Turkish woman in the book because I happened to be one. We often talk about how stories change the world  but we should also see how the world of identity politics affects the way stories are being circulated  read and reviewed. Many authors feel this pressure  but non Western authors feel it more heavily. If you're a woman writer from the Muslim world  like me  then you are expected to write the stories of Muslim women and  preferably  the unhappy stories of unhappy Muslim women. You're expected to write informative  poignant and characteristic stories and leave the experimental and avant garde to your Western colleagues. What I experienced as a child in that school in Madrid is happening in the literary world today. Writers are not seen as creative individuals on their own  but as the representatives of their respective cultures  a few authors from China  a few from Turkey  a few from Nigeria. We're all thought to have something very distinctive  if not peculiar. The writer and commuter James Baldwin gave an interview in      in which he was repeatedly asked about his homosexuality. When the interviewer tried to pigeonhole him as a gay writer  Baldwin stopped and said   But don't you see  There's nothing in me that is not in everybody else  and nothing in everybody else that is not in me.  When identity politics tries to put labels on us  it is our freedom of imagination that is in danger. There's a fuzzy category called multicultural literature in which all authors from outside the Western world are lumped together. I never forget my first multicultural reading  in Harvard Square about    years ago. We were three writers  one from the Philippines  one Turkish and one Indonesian    like a joke  you know. And the reason why we were brought together was not because we shared an artistic style or a literary taste. It was only because of our passports. Multicultural writers are expected to tell real stories  not so much the imaginary. A function is attributed to fiction. In this way  not only the writers themselves  but also their fictional characters become the representatives of something larger. But I must quickly add that this tendency to see a story as more than a story does not solely come from the West. It comes from everywhere. And I experienced this firsthand when I was put on trial in      for the words my fictional characters uttered in a novel. I had intended to write a constructive  multi layered novel about an Armenian and a Turkish family through the eyes of women. My micro story became a macro issue when I was prosecuted. Some people criticized  others praised me for writing about the Turkish Armenian conflict. But there were times when I wanted to remind both sides that this was fiction. It was just a story. And when I say   just a story   I'm not trying to belittle my work. I want to love and celebrate fiction for what it is  not as a means to an end. Writers are entitled to their political opinions  and there are good political novels out there  but the language of fiction is not the language of daily politics. Chekhov said   The solution to a problem and the correct way of posing the question are two completely separate things. And only the latter is an artist's responsibility.  Identity politics divides us. Fiction connects. One is interested in sweeping generalizations. The other  in nuances. One draws boundaries. The other recognizes no frontiers. Identity politics is made of solid bricks. Fiction is flowing water. In the Ottoman times  there were itinerant storytellers called  meddah.  They would go to coffee houses  where they would tell a story in front of an audience  often improvising. With each new person in the story  the meddah would change his voice  impersonating that character. Everybody could go and listen  you know    ordinary people  even the sultan  Muslims and non Muslims. Stories cut across all boundaries  like  The Tales of Nasreddin Hodja   which were very popular throughout the Middle East  North Africa  the Balkans and Asia. Today  stories continue to transcend borders. When Palestinian and Israeli politicians talk  they usually don't listen to each other  but a Palestinian reader still reads a novel by a Jewish author  and vice versa  connecting and empathizing with the narrator. Literature has to take us beyond. If it cannot take us there  it is not good literature. Books have saved the introverted  timid child that I was    that I once was. But I'm also aware of the danger of fetishizing them. When the poet and mystic  Rumi  met his spiritual companion  Shams of Tabriz  one of the first things the latter did was to toss Rumi's books into water and watch the letters dissolve. The Sufis say   Knowledge that takes you not beyond yourself is far worse than ignorance.  The problem with today's cultural ghettos is not lack of knowledge    we know a lot about each other  or so we think    but knowledge that takes us not beyond ourselves  it makes us elitist  distant and disconnected. There's a metaphor which I love  living like a drawing compass. As you know  one leg of the compass is static  rooted in a place. Meanwhile  the other leg draws a wide circle  constantly moving. Like that  my fiction as well. One part of it is rooted in Istanbul  with strong Turkish roots  but the other part travels the world  connecting to different cultures. In that sense  I like to think of my fiction as both local and universal  both from here and everywhere. Now those of you who have been to Istanbul have probably seen Topkapi Palace  which was the residence of Ottoman sultans for more than     years. In the palace  just outside the quarters of the favorite concubines  there's an area called The Gathering Place of the Djinn. It's between buildings. I'm intrigued by this concept. We usually distrust those areas that fall in between things. We see them as the domain of supernatural creatures like the djinn  who are made of smokeless fire and are the symbol of elusiveness. But my point is perhaps that elusive space is what writers and artists need most. When I write fiction I cherish elusiveness and changeability. I like not knowing what will happen    pages later. I like it when my characters surprise me. I might write about a Muslim woman in one novel  and perhaps it will be a very happy story  and in my next book  I might write about a handsome  gay professor in Norway. As long as it comes from our hearts  we can write about anything and everything. Audre Lorde once said   The white fathers taught us to say  'I think  therefore I am.'  She suggested   I feel  therefore I am free.  I think it was a wonderful paradigm shift. And yet  why is it that  in creative writing courses today  the very first thing we teach students is  write what you know   Perhaps that's not the right way to start at all. Imaginative literature is not necessarily about writing who we are or what we know or what our identity is about. We should teach young people and ourselves to expand our hearts and write what we can feel. We should get out of our cultural ghetto and go visit the next one and the next. In the end  stories move like whirling dervishes  drawing circles beyond circles. They connect all humanity  regardless of identity politics  and that is the good news. And I would like to finish with an old Sufi poem   Come  let us be friends for once  let us make life easy on us  let us be lovers and loved ones  the earth shall be left to no one.  Thank you. Chris Anderson  Julian  welcome. It's been reported that WikiLeaks  your baby  has  in the last few years has released more classified documents than the rest of the world's media combined. Can that possibly be true  Julian Assange  Yeah  can it possibly be true  It's a worry    isn't it     that the rest of the world's media is doing such a bad job that a little group of activists is able to release more of that type of information than the rest of the world press combined. CA  How does it work  How do people release the documents  And how do you secure their privacy  JA  So these are    as far as we can tell    classical whistleblowers  and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us. So we use this state of the art encryption to bounce stuff around the Internet  to hide trails  pass it through legal jurisdictions like Sweden and Belgium to enact those legal protections. We get information in the mail  the regular postal mail  encrypted or not  vet it like a regular news organization  format it    which is sometimes something that's quite hard to do  when you're talking about giant databases of information    release it to the public and then defend ourselves against the inevitable legal and political attacks. CA  So you make an effort to ensure the documents are legitimate  but you actually almost never know who the identity of the source is  JA  That's right  yeah. Very rarely do we ever know  and if we find out at some stage then we destroy that information as soon as possible. CA  I think that's the CIA asking what the code is for a TED membership. So let's take  an  example  actually. This is something you leaked a few years ago. If we can have this document up ... So this was a story in Kenya a few years ago. Can you tell us what you leaked and what happened  JA  So this is the Kroll Report. This was a secret intelligence report commissioned by the Kenyan government after its election in     . Prior to       Kenya was ruled by Daniel arap Moi for about    years. He was a soft dictator of Kenya. And when Kibaki got into power    through a coalition of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in Kenya    they commissioned this report  spent about two million pounds on this and an associated report. And then the government sat on it and used it for political leverage on Moi  who was the richest man    still is the richest man    in Kenya. It's the Holy Grail of Kenyan journalism. So I went there in       and we managed to get hold of this just prior to the election    the national election  December   . When we released that report  we did so three days after the new president  Kibaki  had decided to pal up with the man that he was going to clean out  Daniel arap Moi  so this report then became a dead albatross around President Kibaki's neck. CA  And    I mean  to cut a long story short    word of the report leaked into Kenya  not from the official media  but indirectly  and in your opinion  it actually shifted the election. JA  Yeah. So this became front page of the Guardian and was then printed in all the surrounding countries of Kenya  in Tanzanian and South African press. And so it came in from the outside. And that  after a couple of days  made the Kenyan press feel safe to talk about it. And it ran for    nights straight on Kenyan TV  shifted the vote by    percent  according to a Kenyan intelligence report  which changed the result of the election. CA  Wow  so your leak really substantially changed the world  JA  Yep. CA  Here's    We're going to just show a short clip from this Baghdad airstrike video. The video itself is longer  but here's a short clip. This is    this is intense material  I should warn you. Radio  ... just fuckin'  once you get on 'em just open 'em up. I see your element  uh  got about four Humvees  uh  out along ... You're clear. All right. Firing. Let me know when you've got them. Let's shoot. Light 'em all up. C'mon  fire  Keep shoot 'n. Keep shoot 'n. Keep shoot 'n. Hotel ... Bushmaster Two Six  Bushmaster Two Six  we need to move  time now  All right  we just engaged all eight individuals. Yeah  we see two birds  helicopters   and we're still firing. Roger. I got 'em. Two Six  this is Two Six  we're mobile. Oops  I'm sorry. What was going on  God damn it  Kyle. All right  hahaha. I hit 'em. CA  So  what was the impact of that  JA  The impact on the people who worked on it was severe. We ended up sending two people to Baghdad to further research that story. So this is just the first of three attacks that occurred in that scene. CA  So  I mean     people died in that attack  right  including two Reuters employees  JA  Yeah. Two Reuters employees  two young children were wounded. There were between    and    people killed all together. CA  And releasing this caused widespread outrage. What was the key element of this that actually caused the outrage  do you think  JA  I don't know. I guess people can see the gross disparity in force. You have guys walking in a relaxed way down the street  and then an Apache helicopter sitting up at one kilometer firing    millimeter cannon shells on everyone    looking for any excuse to do so    and killing people rescuing the wounded. And there was two journalists involved that clearly weren't insurgents because that's their full time job. CA  I mean  there's been this U.S. intelligence analyst  Bradley Manning  arrested  and it's alleged that he confessed in a chat room to have leaked this video to you  along with         classified U.S. embassy cables. I mean  did he  JA  We have denied receiving those cables. He has been charged  about five days ago  with obtaining         cables and releasing   . Now  we had released  early in the year  a cable from the Reykjavik U.S. embassy  but this is not necessarily connected. I mean  I was a known visitor of that embassy. CA  I mean  if you did receive thousands of U.S. embassy diplomatic cables ... JA  We would have released them.  CA  You would   JA  Yeah.  CA  Because   JA  Well  because these sort of things reveal what the true state of  say  Arab governments are like  the true human rights abuses in those governments. If you look at declassified cables  that's the sort of material that's there. CA  So let's talk a little more broadly about this. I mean  in general  what's your philosophy  Why is it right to encourage leaking of secret information  JA  Well  there's a question as to what sort of information is important in the world  what sort of information can achieve reform. And there's a lot of information. So information that organizations are spending economic effort into concealing  that's a really good signal that when the information gets out  there's a hope of it doing some good    because the organizations that know it best  that know it from the inside out  are spending work to conceal it. And that's what we've found in practice  and that's what the history of journalism is. CA  But are there risks with that  either to the individuals concerned or indeed to society at large  where leaking can actually have an unintended consequence  JA  Not that we have seen with anything we have released. I mean  we have a harm immunization policy. We have a way of dealing with information that has sort of personal    personally identifying information in it. But there are legitimate secrets    you know  your records with your doctor  that's a legitimate secret    but we deal with whistleblowers that are coming forward that are really sort of well motivated. CA  So they are well motivated. And what would you say to  for example  the  you know  the parent of someone whose son is out serving the U.S. military  and he says   You know what  you've put up something that someone had an incentive to put out. It shows a U.S. soldier laughing at people dying. That gives the impression  has given the impression  to millions of people around the world that U.S. soldiers are inhuman people. Actually  they're not. My son isn't. How dare you   What would you say to that  JA  Yeah  we do get a lot of that. But remember  the people in Baghdad  the people in Iraq  the people in Afghanistan    they don't need to see the video  they see it every day. So it's not going to change their opinion. It's not going to change their perception. That's what they see every day. It will change the perception and opinion of the people who are paying for it all  and that's our hope. CA  So you found a way to shine light into what you see as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government. Light is good. But do you see any irony in the fact that  in order for you to shine that light  you have to  yourself  create secrecy around your sources  JA  Not really. I mean  we don't have any WikiLeaks dissidents yet. We don't have sources who are dissidents on other sources. Should they come forward  that would be a tricky situation for us  but we're presumably acting in such a way that people feel morally compelled to continue our mission  not to screw it up. CA  I'd actually be interested  just based on what we've heard so far    I'm curious as to the opinion in the TED audience. You know  there might be a couple of views of WikiLeaks and of Julian. You know  hero    people's hero    bringing this important light. Dangerous troublemaker. Who's got the hero view  Who's got the dangerous troublemaker view  JA  Oh  come on. There must be some. CA  It's a soft crowd  Julian  a soft crowd. We have to try better. Let's show them another example. Now here's something that you haven't yet leaked  but I think for TED you are. I mean it's an intriguing story that's just happened  right  What is this  JA  So this is a sample of what we do sort of every day. So late last year    in November last year    there was a series of well blowouts in Albania  like the well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico  but not quite as big. And we got a report    a sort of engineering analysis into what happened    saying that  in fact  security guards from some rival  various competing oil firms had  in fact  parked trucks there and blown them up. And part of the Albanian government was in this  etc.  etc. And the engineering report had nothing on the top of it  so it was an extremely difficult document for us. We couldn't verify it because we didn't know who wrote it and knew what it was about. So we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up. So under that basis  we put it out and said   Look  we're skeptical about this thing. We don't know  but what can we do  The material looks good  it feels right  but we just can't verify it.  And we then got a letter just this week from the company who wrote it  wanting to track down the source    saying   Hey  we want to track down the source.  And we were like   Oh  tell us more. What document is it  precisely  you're talking about  Can you show that you had legal authority over that document  Is it really yours   So they sent us this screen shot with the author in the Microsoft Word ID. Yeah. That's happened quite a lot though. This is like one of our methods of identifying  of verifying  what a material is  is to try and get these guys to write letters. CA  Yeah. Have you had information from inside BP  JA  Yeah  we have a lot  but I mean  at the moment  we are undergoing a sort of serious fundraising and engineering effort. So our publication rate over the past few months has been sort of minimized while we're re engineering our back systems for the phenomenal public interest that we have. That's a problem. I mean  like any sort of growing startup organization  we are sort of overwhelmed by our growth  and that means we're getting enormous quantity of whistleblower disclosures of a very high caliber but don't have enough people to actually process and vet this information. CA  So that's the key bottleneck  basically journalistic volunteers and or the funding of journalistic salaries  JA  Yep. Yeah  and trusted people. I mean  we're an organization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with  so we have to restructure in order to have people who will deal with the highest national security stuff  and then lower security cases. CA  So help us understand a bit about you personally and how you came to do this. And I think I read that as a kid you went to    different schools. Can that be right  JA  Well  my parents were in the movie business and then on the run from a cult  so the combination between the two ... CA  I mean  a psychologist might say that's a recipe for breeding paranoia. JA  What  the movie business  CA  And you were also    I mean  you were also a hacker at an early age and ran into the authorities early on. JA  Well  I was a journalist. You know  I was a very young journalist activist at an early age. I wrote a magazine  was prosecuted for it when I was a teenager. So you have to be careful with hacker. I mean there's like    there's a method that can be deployed for various things. Unfortunately  at the moment  it's mostly deployed by the Russian mafia in order to steal your grandmother's bank accounts. So this phrase is not  not as nice as it used to be. CA  Yeah  well  I certainly don't think you're stealing anyone's grandmother's bank account  but what about your core values  Can you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some incident in your life that helped determine them  JA  I'm not sure about the incident. But the core values  well  capable  generous men do not create victims  they nurture victims. And that's something from my father and something from other capable  generous men that have been in my life. CA  Capable  generous men do not create victims  they nurture victims  JA  Yeah. And you know  I'm a combative person  so I'm not actually so big on the nurture  but some way    there is another way of nurturing victims  which is to police perpetrators of crime. And so that is something that has been in my character for a long time. CA  So just tell us  very quickly in the last minute  the story  what happened in Iceland  You basically published something there  ran into trouble with a bank  then the news service there was injuncted from running the story. Instead  they publicized your side. That made you very high profile in Iceland. What happened next  JA  Yeah  this is a great case  you know. Iceland went through this financial crisis. It was the hardest hit of any country in the world. Its banking sector was    times the GDP of the rest of the economy. Anyway  so we release this report in July last year. And the national TV station was injuncted five minutes before it went on air  like out of a movie  injunction landed on the news desk  and the news reader was like   This has never happened before. What do we do   Well  we just show the website instead  for all that time  as a filler  and we became very famous in Iceland  went to Iceland and spoke about this issue. And there was a feeling in the community that that should never happen again  and as a result  working with Icelandic politicians and some other international legal experts  we put together a new sort of package of legislation for Iceland to sort of become an offshore haven for the free press  with the strongest journalistic protections in the world  with a new Nobel Prize for freedom of speech. Iceland's a Nordic country  so  like Norway  it's able to tap into the system. And just a month ago  this was passed by the Icelandic parliament unanimously. CA  Wow. Last question  Julian. When you think of the future then  do you think it's more likely to be Big Brother exerting more control  more secrecy  or us watching Big Brother  or it's just all to be played for either way  JA  I'm not sure which way it's going to go. I mean  there's enormous pressures to harmonize freedom of speech legislation and transparency legislation around the world    within the E.U.  between China and the United States. Which way is it going to go  It's hard to see. That's why it's a very interesting time to be in    because with just a little bit of effort  we can shift it one way or the other. CA  Well  it looks like I'm reflecting the audience's opinion to say  Julian  be careful  and all power to you. JA  Thank you  Chris.  CA  Thank you.  In October       the Justice League of America will be teaming up with The   . Icons like Batman  Superman  Wonder Woman and their colleagues will be teaming up with icons Jabbar  Noora  Jami and their colleagues. It's a story of intercultural intersections  and what better group to have this conversation than those that grew out of fighting fascism in their respective histories and geographies  As fascism took over Europe in the     s  an unlikely reaction came out of North America. As Christian iconography got changed  and swastikas were created out of crucifixes  Batman and Superman were created by Jewish young men in the United States and Canada  also going back to the Bible. Consider this  like the prophets  all the superheroes are missing parents. Superman's parents die on Krypton before the age of one. Bruce Wayne  who becomes Batman  loses his parents at the age of six in Gotham City. Spiderman is raised by his aunt and uncle. And all of them  just like the prophets who get their message from God through Gabriel  get their message from above. Peter Parker is in a library in Manhattan when the spider descends from above and gives him his message through a bite. Bruce Wayne is in his bedroom when a big bat flies over his head  and he sees it as an omen to become Batman. Superman is not only sent to Earth from the heavens  or Krypton  but he's sent in a pod  much like Moses was on the Nile. And you hear the voice of his father  Jor El  saying to Earth   I have sent to you my only son.  These are clearly biblical archetypes  and the thinking behind that was to create positive  globally resonating storylines that could be tied to the same things that other people were pulling mean messages out of because then the person that's using religion for the wrong purpose just becomes a bad man with a bad message. And it's only by linking positive things that the negative can be delinked. This is the kind of thinking that went into creating The   . The    references the    attributes of Allah in the Koran  things like generosity and mercy and foresight and wisdom and dozens of others that no two people in the world would disagree about. It doesn't matter what your religion is  even if you're an atheist  you don't raise your kid telling him  you know   Make sure you lie three times a day.  Those are basic human values. And so the backstory of The    takes place in       which history tells us the Mongols invaded Baghdad and destroyed it. All the books from Bait al Hikma library  the most famous library in its day  were thrown in the Tigris River  and the Tigris changes color with ink. It's a story passed on generation after generation. I rewrote that story  and in my version  the librarians find out that this is going to happen    and here's a side note  if you want a comic book to do well  make the librarians the hero. It always works well. So the librarians find out and they get together a special solution  a chemical solution called King's Water  that when mixed with    stones would be able to save all that culture and history in the books. But the Mongols get there first. The books and the solution get thrown in the Tigris River. Some librarians escape  and over the course of days and weeks  they dip the stones into the Tigris and suck up that collective wisdom that we all think is lost to civilization. Those stones have been smuggled as three prayer beads of    stones each through Arabia into Andalusia in Spain  where they're safe for     years. But in       two important things happen. The first is the fall of Granada  the last Muslim enclave in Europe. The second is Columbus finally gets funded to go to India  but he gets lost. So    of the stones are smuggled onto the Nina  the Pinta and the Santa Maria and are spread in the New World. Thirty three go on the Silk Road to China  South Asia and Southeast Asia. And    are spread between Europe  the Middle East and Africa. And now it's       and there are    heroes from    different countries. Now it's very easy to assume that those books  because they were from a library called Bait al Hikma  were Muslim books  but that's not the case because the caliph that built that library  his name was al Ma'mun    he was Harun al Rashid's son. He had told his advisers   Get me all the scholars to translate any book they can get their hands onto into Arabic  and I will pay them its weight in gold.  After a while  his advisers complained. They said   Your Highness  the scholars are cheating. They're writing in big handwriting to take more gold.  To which he said   Let them be  because what they're giving us is worth a lot more than what we're paying them.  So the idea of an open architecture  an open knowledge  is not new to my neck of the desert. The concept centers on something called the Noor stones. Noor is Arabic for light. So these    stones  a few kind of rules in the game  Number one  you don't choose the stone  the stone chooses you. There's a King Arthur element to the storyline  okay. Number two  all of The     when they first get their stone  or their power  abuse it  they use it for self interest. And there's a very strong message in there that when you start abusing your stone  you get taken advantage of by people who will exploit your powers  okay. Number three  the    stones all have within them a mechanism that self updates. Now there are two groups that exist within the Muslim world. Everybody believes the Koran is for all time and all place. Some believe that means that the original interpretation from a couple thousand years ago is what's relevant today. I don't belong there. Then there's a group that believes the Koran is a living  breathing document  and I captured that idea within these stones that self update. Now the main bad guy  Rughal  does not want these stones to update  so he's trying to get them to stop updating. He can't use the stones  but he can stop them. And by stopping them  he has more of a fascist agenda  where he gets some of The    to work for him    they're all wearing cookie cutter  same color uniforms They're not allowed to individually express who they are and what they are. And he controls them from the top down    whereas when they work for the other side  eventually  when they find out this is the wrong person  they've been manipulated  they actually  each one has a different  colorful kind of dress. And the last point about the    Noor stones is this. So The    work in teams of three. Why three  A couple of reasons. Number one  we have a thing within Islam that you don't leave a boy and a girl alone together  because the third person is temptation or the devil  right  I think that's there in all cultures  right  But this is not about religion  it's not about proselytizing. There's this very strong social message that needs to get to kind of the deepest crevices of intolerance  and the only way to get there is to kind of play the game. And so this is the way I dealt with it. They work in teams of three  two boys and a girl  two girls and a boy  three boys  three girls  no problem. And the Swiss psychoanalyst  Carl Jung  also spoke about the importance of the number three in all cultures  so I figure I'm covered. Well ... I got accused in a few blogs that I was actually sent by the Pope to preach the Trinity and Catholicism in the Middle East  so you     Laughter  you believe who you want. I gave you my version of the story. So here's some of the characters that we have. Mujiba  from Malaysia  her main power is she's able to answer any question. She's the Trivial Pursuit queen  if you want  but when she first gets her power  she starts going on game shows and making money. We have Jabbar from Saudi who starts breaking things when he has the power. Now  Mumita was a fun one to name. Mumita is the destroyer. So the    attributes of Allah have the yin and the yang  there's the powerful  the hegemonous  the strong  and there's also the kind  the generous. I'm like  are all the girls going to be kind and merciful and the guys all strong  I'm like  you know what  I've met a few girls who were destroyers in my lifetime  so ... We have Jami from Hungary  who first starts making weapons  He's the technology wiz. Musawwira from Ghana  Hadya from Pakistan  Jaleel from Iran who uses fire. And this is one of my favorites  Al Batina from Yemen. Al Batina is the hidden. So Al Batina is hidden  but she's a superhero. I came home to my wife and I said   I created a character after you.  My wife is a Saudi from Yemeni roots. And she said   Show me.  So I showed this. She said   That's not me.  I said   Look at the eyes. They're your eyes.  So I promised my investors this would not be another made in fifth world country production. This was going to be Superman  or it wasn't worth my time or their money. So from day one  the people involved in the project  bottom left is Fabian Nicieza  writer for X Men and Power Rangers. Next to him is Dan Panosian  one of the character creators for the modern day X Men. Top right is Stuart Moore  a writer for Iron Man. Next to him is John McCrea  who was an inker for Spiderman. And we entered Western consciousness with a tagline   Next Ramadan  the world will have new heroes   back in     . Now I went to Dubai  to an Arab Thought Foundation Conference  and I was waiting by the coffee for the right journalist. Didn't have a product  but had energy. And I found somebody from The New York Times  and I cornered him  and I pitched him. And I think I scared him     Laughter  because he basically promised me    we had no product    but he said   We'll give you a paragraph in the arts section if you'll just go away.  So I said   Great.  So I called him up a few weeks afterward. I said   Hi  Hesa.  And he said   Hi.  I said   Happy New Year.  He said   Thank you. We had a baby.  I said   Congratulations.  Like I care  right   So when's the article coming out   He said   Naif  Islam and cartoon  That's not timely. You know  maybe next week  next month  next year  but  you know  it'll come out.  So a few days after that  what happens  What happens is the world erupts in the Danish cartoon controversy. I became timely. So flurry of phone calls and emails from The New York Times. Next thing you knew  there's a full page covering us positively  January   nd        which changed our lives forever  because anybody Googling Islam and cartoon or Islam and comic  guess what they got  they got me. And The    were like superheroes kind of flying out of what was happening around the world. And that led to all kinds of things  from being in curricula in universities and schools to    one of my favorite pictures I have from South Asia  it was a couple of men with long beards and a lot of girls wearing the hijab    it looked like a school. The good news is they're all holding copies of The     smiling  and they found me to sign the picture. The bad news is they were all photocopies  so we didn't make a dime in revenue. We've been able to license The    comic books into eight languages so far    Chinese  Indonesian  Hindi  Urdu  Turkish. Opened a theme park through a license in Kuwait a year and a half ago called The    Village Theme Park            square feet     rides  all with our characters  a couple back to school licenses in Spain and Turkey. But the biggest thing we've done to date  which is just amazing  is that we've done a    episode animated series  which is done for global audiences  in fact  we're already going to be in the U.S. and Turkey  we know. It's  D CGI  which is going to be very high quality  written in Hollywood by the writers behind Ben    and Spiderman and Star Wars  Clone Wars. In this clip I'm about to show you  which has never been seen in the public before  there is a struggle. Two of the characters  Jabbar  the one with the muscles  and Noora  the one that can use light  are actually wearing the cookie cutter fascist gray uniform because they're being manipulated. They don't know  OK  and they're trying to get another member of The    to join them. So there's a struggle within the team. So if we can get the lights ...   The      Jabbar  Dana  I can't see where to grab hold. I need more light. What's happening  Dana  There's too much darkness. Rughal  There must be something we can do. Man  I won't send any more commandos in until I know it's safe. Dr. Razem  It's time to go  Miklos. Miklos  Must download file contents. I can't forget auntie. Jabbar  Dana  I can't do this without you. Dana  But I can't help. Jabbar  You can  even if you don't believe in yourself right now. I believe in you. You are Noora the Light. Dana  No. I don't deserve it. I don't deserve anything. Jabbar  Then what about the rest of us  Don't we deserve to be saved  Don't I  Now  tell me which way to go. Dana  That way. Alarm  Threat imminent. Jabbar  Aaaahhh  Miklos  Stay away from me. Jabbar  We're here to help you. Dr. Razem  Don't listen to them. Dana  Miklos  that man is not your friend. Miklos  No. He gave me access  and you want to reboot the  unclear . No more  unclear .   The      Thank you. So  The     is technology  it's entertainment  it's design. But that's only half the story. As the father of five sons  I worry about who they're going to be using as role models. I worry because all around me  even within my extended family  I see religion being manipulated. As a psychologist  I worry for the world in general  but worry about the perception of how people see themselves in my part of the world. Now  I'm a clinical psychologist. I'm licensed in New York State. I trained at Bellevue Hospital Survivors of Political Torture Program  and I heard one too many stories of people growing up to idolize their leadership  only to end up being tortured by their heroes. And torture's a terrible enough thing as it is  but when it's done by your hero  that just breaks you in so many ways. I left Bellevue  went to business school and started this. Now  one of the things that I refer to when I    about the importance of this message    is that I gave a lecture at the medical school at Kuwait University  where I lecture on the biological basis of behavior  and I gave the students two articles  one from The New York Times and one from New York magazine. And I took away the name of the writer  the name of the  unclear     everything was gone except the facts. And the first one was about a group called The Party of God  who wanted to ban Valentine's Day. Red was made illegal. Any boys and girls caught flirting would get married off immediately  okay. The second one was about a woman complaining because three minivans with six bearded men pulled up and started interrogating her on the spot for talking to a man who wasn't related to her. And I asked the students in Kuwait where they thought these incidents took place. The first one  they said Saudi Arabia. There was no debate. The second one  they were actually split between Saudi and Afghanistan. What blew their mind was the first one took place in India  it was the party of a Hindu God. The second one took place in upstate New York. It was an Orthodox Jewish community. But what breaks my heart and what's alarming is that in those two interviews  the people around  who were interviewed as well  refer to that behavior as Talibanization. In other words  good Hindus and good Jews don't act this way. This is Islam's influence on Hinduism and Judaism. But what do the students in Kuwait say  They said it's us    and this is dangerous. It's dangerous when a group self identifies itself as extreme. This is one of my sons  Rayan  who's a Scooby Doo addict. You can tell by the glasses there. He actually called me a meddling kid the other day. But I borrow a lesson that I learned from him. Last summer when we were in our home in New York  he was out in the yard playing in his playhouse. And I was in my office working  and he came in   Baba  I want you to come with me. I want my toy.   Yes  Rayan  just go away.  He left his Scooby Doo in his house. I said   Go away. I'm working. I'm busy.  And what Rayan did then is he sat there  he tapped his foot on the floor  at three and a half  and he looked at me and he said   Baba  I want you to come with me to my office in my house. I have work to do.  Rayan reframed the situation and brought himself down to my level. And with The     that is what we aim to do. You know  I think that there's a big parallel between bending the crucifix out of shape and creating swastikas. And when I see pictures like this  of parents or uncles who think it's cute to have a little child holding a Koran and having a suicide bomber belt around them to protest something  the hope is by linking enough positive things to the Koran  that one day we can move this child from being proud in the way they're proud there  to that. And I think    I think The    can and will achieve its mission. As an undergrad at Tufts University  we were giving away free falafel one day and  you know  it was Middle East Day or something. And people came up and picked up the culturally resonant image of the falafel  ate it and  you know  talked and left. And no two people could disagree about what the word free was and what the word falafel was  behind us   free falafel.  You know. Or so we thought  until a woman came rushing across the campus and dropped her bag on the floor  pointed up to the sign and said   Who's falafel   True story. She was actually coming out of an Amnesty International meeting. Just today  D.C. Comics announced the cover of our upcoming crossover. On that cover you see Batman  Superman and a fully clothed Wonder Woman with our Saudi member of The     our Emirati member and our Libyan member. On April           President Barack Obama said that of all the initiatives since his now famous Cairo speech    in which he reached out to the Muslim world    the most innovative was that The    reach back out to the Justice League of America. We live in a world in which the most culturally innocuous symbols  like the falafel  can be misunderstood because of baggage  and where religion can be twisted and purposefully made where it's not supposed to be by others. In a world like that  they'll always be a job for Superman and The   . Thank you very much. Well  indeed  I'm very  very lucky. My talk essentially got written by three historic events that happened within days of each other in the last two months    seemingly unrelated  but as you will see  actually all having to do with the story I want to tell you today. The first one was actually a funeral    to be more precise  a reburial. On May   nd  there was a hero's reburial in Frombork  Poland of the   th century astronomer who actually changed the world. He did that  literally  by replacing the Earth with the Sun in the center of the Solar System  and then with this simple looking act  he actually launched a scientific and technological revolution  which many call the Copernican Revolution. Now that was  ironically  and very befittingly  the way we found his grave. As it was the custom of the time  Copernicus was actually simply buried in an unmarked grave  together with    others in that cathedral. DNA analysis  one of the hallmarks of the scientific revolution of the last     years that he started  was the way we found which set of bones actually belonged to the person who read all those astronomical books which were filled with leftover hair that was Copernicus' hair    obviously not many other people bothered to read these books later on. That match was unambiguous. The DNA matched  and we know that this was indeed Nicolaus Copernicus. Now  the connection between biology and DNA and life is very tantalizing when you talk about Copernicus because  even back then  his followers very quickly made the logical step to ask  if the Earth is just a planet  then what about planets around other stars  What about the idea of the plurality of the worlds  about life on other planets  In fact  I'm borrowing here from one of those very popular books of the time. And at the time  people actually answered that question positively   Yes.  But there was no evidence. And here begins     years of frustration  of unfulfilled dreams    the dreams of Galileo  Giordano Bruno  many others    which never led to the answer of those very basic questions which humanity has asked all the time.  What is life  What is the origin of life  Are we alone   And that especially happened in the last    years  at the end of the   th century  when the beautiful developments due to molecular biology  understanding the code of life  DNA  all of that seemed to actually put us  not closer  but further apart from answering those basic questions. Now  the good news. A lot has happened in the last few years  and let's start with the planets. Let's start with the old Copernican question  Are there earths around other stars  And as we already heard  there is a way in which we are trying  and now able  to answer that question. It's a new telescope. Our team  befittingly I think  named it after one of those dreamers of the Copernican time  Johannes Kepler  and that telescope's sole purpose is to go out  find the planets that orbit other stars in our galaxy  and tell us how often do planets like our own Earth happen to be out there. The telescope is actually built similarly to the  well known to you  Hubble Space Telescope  except it does have an additional lens    a wide field lens  as you would call it as a photographer. And if  in the next couple of months  you walk out in the early evening and look straight up and place you palm like this  you will actually be looking at the field of the sky where this telescope is searching for planets day and night  without any interruption  for the next four years. The way we do that  actually  is with a method  which we call the transit method. It's actually mini eclipses that occur when a planet passes in front of its star. Not all of the planets will be fortuitously oriented for us to be able do that  but if you have a million stars  you'll find enough planets. And as you see on this animation  what Kepler is going to detect is just the dimming of the light from the star. We are not going to see the image of the star and the planet as this. All the stars for Kepler are just points of light. But we learn a lot from that  not only that there is a planet there  but we also learn its size. How much of the light is being dimmed depends on how big the planet is. We learn about its orbit  the period of its orbit and so on. So  what have we learned  Well  let me try to walk you through what we actually see and so you understand the news that I'm here to tell you today. What Kepler does is discover a lot of candidates  which we then follow up and find as planets  confirm as planets. It basically tells us this is the distribution of planets in size. There are small planets  there are bigger planets  there are big planets  okay. So we count many  many such planets  and they have different sizes. We do that in our solar system. In fact  even back during the ancients  the Solar System in that sense would look on a diagram like this. There will be the smaller planets  and there will be the big planets  even back to the time of Epicurus and then of course Copernicus and his followers. Up until recently  that was the Solar System    four Earth like planets with small radius  smaller than about two times the size of the Earth    and that was of course Mercury  Venus  Mars  and of course the Earth  and then the two big  giant planets. Then the Copernican Revolution brought in telescopes  and of course three more planets were discovered. Now the total planet number in our solar system was nine. The small planets dominated  and there was a certain harmony to that  which actually Copernicus was very happy to note  and Kepler was one of the big proponents of. So now we have Pluto to join the numbers of small planets. But up until  literally     years ago  that was all we knew about planets. And that's what the frustration was. The Copernican dream was unfulfilled. Finally     years ago  the technology came to the point where we could discover a planet around another star  and we actually did pretty well. In the next    years  almost     planets were discovered orbiting other stars  with different methods. Unfortunately  as you can see  there was a very different picture. There was of course an explanation for it  We only see the big planets  so that's why most of those planets are really in the category of  like Jupiter.  But you see  we haven't gone very far. We were still back where Copernicus was. We didn't have any evidence whether planets like the Earth are out there. And we do care about planets like the Earth because by now we understood that life as a chemical system really needs a smaller planet with water and with rocks and with a lot of complex chemistry to originate  to emerge  to survive. And we didn't have the evidence for that. So today  I'm here to actually give you a first glimpse of what the new telescope  Kepler  has been able to tell us in the last few weeks  and  lo and behold  we are back to the harmony and to fulfilling the dreams of Copernicus. You can see here  the small planets dominate the picture. The planets which are marked  like Earth    are  definitely more than any other planets that we see. And now for the first time  we can say that. There is a lot more work we need to do with this. Most of these are candidates. In the next few years we will confirm them. But the statistical result is loud and clear. And the statistical result is that planets like our own Earth are out there. Our own Milky Way Galaxy is rich in this kind of planets. So the question is  what do we do next  Well  first of all  we can study them now that we know where they are. And we can find those that we would call habitable  meaning that they have similar conditions to the conditions that we experience here on Earth and where a lot of complex chemistry can happen. So  we can even put a number to how many of those planets now do we expect our own Milky Way Galaxy harbors. And the number  as you might expect  is pretty staggering. It's about     million such planets. That's great news. Why  Because with our own little telescope  just in the next two years  we'll be able to identify at least    of them. So that's great because then we can go and study them    remotely  of course    with all the techniques that we already have tested in the past five years. We can find what they're made of  would their atmospheres have water  carbon dioxide  methane. We know and expect that we'll see that. That's great  but that is not the whole news. That's not why I'm here. Why I'm here is to tell you that the next step is really the exciting part. The one that this step is enabling us to do is coming next. And here comes biology    biology  with its basic question  which still stands unanswered  which is essentially   If there is life on other planets  do we expect it to be like life on Earth   And let me immediately tell you here  when I say life  I don't mean  dolce vita   good life  human life. I really mean life on Earth  past and present  from microbes to us humans  in its rich molecular diversity  the way we now understand life on Earth as being a set of molecules and chemical reactions    and we call that  collectively  biochemistry  life as a chemical process  as a chemical phenomenon. So the question is  is that chemical phenomenon universal  or is it something which depends on the planet  Is it like gravity  which is the same everywhere in the universe  or there would be all kinds of different biochemistries wherever we find them  We need to know what we are looking for when we try to do that. And that's a very basic question  which we don't know the answer to  but which we can try    and we are trying    to answer in the lab. We don't need to go to space to answer that question. And so  that's what we are trying to do. And that's what many people now are trying to do. And a lot of the good news comes from that part of the bridge that we are trying to build as well. So this is one example that I want to show you here. When we think of what is necessary for the phenomenon that we call life  we think of compartmentalization  keeping the molecules which are important for life in a membrane  isolated from the rest of the environment  but yet  in an environment in which they actually could originate together. And in one of our labs  Jack Szostak's labs  it was a series of experiments in the last four years that showed that the environments    which are very common on planets  on certain types of planets like the Earth  where you have some liquid water and some clays    you actually end up with naturally available molecules which spontaneously form bubbles. But those bubbles have membranes very similar to the membrane of every cell of every living thing on Earth looks like  like this. And they really help molecules  like nucleic acids  like RNA and DNA  stay inside  develop  change  divide and do some of the processes that we call life. Now this is just an example to tell you the pathway in which we are trying to answer that bigger question about the universality of the phenomenon. And in a sense  you can think of that work that people are starting to do now around the world as building a bridge  building a bridge from two sides of the river. On one hand  on the left bank of the river  are the people like me who study those planets and try to define the environments. We don't want to go blind because there's too many possibilities  and there is not too much lab  and there is not enough human time to actually to do all the experiments. So that's what we are building from the left side of the river. From the right bank of the river are the experiments in the lab that I just showed you  where we actually tried that  and it feeds back and forth  and we hope to meet in the middle one day. So why should you care about that  Why am I trying to sell you a half built bridge  Am I that charming  Well  there are many reasons  and you heard some of them in the short talk today. This understanding of chemistry actually can help us with our daily lives. But there is something more profound here  something deeper. And that deeper  underlying point is that science is in the process of redefining life as we know it. And that is going to change our worldview in a profound way    not in a dissimilar way as     years ago  Copernicus' act did  by changing the way we view space and time. Now it's about something else  but it's equally profound. And half the time  what's happened is it's related this kind of sense of insignificance to humankind  to the Earth in a bigger space. And the more we learn  the more that was reinforced. You've all learned that in school    how small the Earth is compared to the immense universe. And the bigger the telescope  the bigger that universe becomes. And look at this image of the tiny  blue dot. This pixel is the Earth. It is the Earth as we know it. It is seen from  in this case  from outside the orbit of Saturn. But it's really tiny. We know that. Let's think of life as that entire planet because  in a sense  it is. The biosphere is the size of the Earth. Life on Earth is the size of the Earth. And let's compare it to the rest of the world in spatial terms. What if that Copernican insignificance was actually all wrong  Would that make us more responsible for what is happening today  Let's actually try that. So in space  the Earth is very small. Can you imagine how small it is  Let me try it. Okay  let's say this is the size of the observable universe  with all the galaxies  with all the stars  okay  from here to here. Do you know what the size of life in this necktie will be  It will be the size of a single  small atom. It is unimaginably small. We can't imagine it. I mean look  you can see the necktie  but you can't even imagine seeing the size of a little  small atom. But that's not the whole story  you see. The universe and life are both in space and time. If that was the age of the universe  then this is the age of life on Earth. Think about those oldest living things on Earth  but in a cosmic proportion. This is not insignificant. This is very significant. So life might be insignificant in size  but it is not insignificant in time. Life and the universe compare to each other like a child and a parent  parent and offspring. So what does this tell us  This tells us that that insignificance paradigm that we somehow got to learn from the Copernican principle  it's all wrong. There is immense  powerful potential in life in this universe    especially now that we know that places like the Earth are common. And that potential  that powerful potential  is also our potential  of you and me. And if we are to be stewards of our planet Earth and its biosphere  we'd better understand the cosmic significance and do something about it. And the good news is we can actually  indeed do it. And let's do it. Let's start this new revolution at the tail end of the old one  with synthetic biology being the way to transform both our environment and our future. And let's hope that we can build this bridge together and meet in the middle. Thank you very much. Up until now  our communication with machines has always been limited to conscious and direct forms. Whether it's something simple like turning on the lights with a switch  or even as complex as programming robotics  we have always had to give a command to a machine  or even a series of commands  in order for it to do something for us. Communication between people  on the other hand  is far more complex and a lot more interesting because we take into account so much more than what is explicitly expressed. We observe facial expressions  body language  and we can intuit feelings and emotions from our dialogue with one another. This actually forms a large part of our decision making process. Our vision is to introduce this whole new realm of human interaction into human computer interaction so that computers can understand not only what you direct it to do  but it can also respond to your facial expressions and emotional experiences. And what better way to do this than by interpreting the signals naturally produced by our brain  our center for control and experience. Well  it sounds like a pretty good idea  but this task  as Bruno mentioned  isn't an easy one for two main reasons  First  the detection algorithms. Our brain is made up of billions of active neurons  around         km of combined axon length. When these neurons interact  the chemical reaction emits an electrical impulse  which can be measured. The majority of our functional brain is distributed over the outer surface layer of the brain  and to increase the area that's available for mental capacity  the brain surface is highly folded. Now this cortical folding presents a significant challenge for interpreting surface electrical impulses. Each individual's cortex is folded differently  very much like a fingerprint. So even though a signal may come from the same functional part of the brain  by the time the structure has been folded  its physical location is very different between individuals  even identical twins. There is no longer any consistency in the surface signals. Our breakthrough was to create an algorithm that unfolds the cortex  so that we can map the signals closer to its source  and therefore making it capable of working across a mass population. The second challenge is the actual device for observing brainwaves. EEG measurements typically involve a hairnet with an array of sensors  like the one that you can see here in the photo. A technician will put the electrodes onto the scalp using a conductive gel or paste and usually after a procedure of preparing the scalp by light abrasion. Now this is quite time consuming and isn't the most comfortable process. And on top of that  these systems actually cost in the tens of thousands of dollars. So with that  I'd like to invite onstage Evan Grant  who is one of last year's speakers  who's kindly agreed to help me to demonstrate what we've been able to develop. So the device that you see is a    channel  high fidelity EEG acquisition system. It doesn't require any scalp preparation  no conductive gel or paste. It only takes a few minutes to put on and for the signals to settle. It's also wireless  so it gives you the freedom to move around. And compared to the tens of thousands of dollars for a traditional EEG system  this headset only costs a few hundred dollars. Now on to the detection algorithms. So facial expressions    as I mentioned before in emotional experiences    are actually designed to work out of the box with some sensitivity adjustments available for personalization. But with the limited time we have available  I'd like to show you the cognitive suite  which is the ability for you to basically move virtual objects with your mind. Now  Evan is new to this system  so what we have to do first is create a new profile for him. He's obviously not Joanne    so we'll  add user.  Evan. Okay. So the first thing we need to do with the cognitive suite is to start with training a neutral signal. With neutral  there's nothing in particular that Evan needs to do. He just hangs out. He's relaxed. And the idea is to establish a baseline or normal state for his brain  because every brain is different. It takes eight seconds to do this  and now that that's done  we can choose a movement based action. So Evan  choose something that you can visualize clearly in your mind. Evan Grant  Let's do  pull.  Tan Le  Okay  so let's choose  pull.  So the idea here now is that Evan needs to imagine the object coming forward into the screen  and there's a progress bar that will scroll across the screen while he's doing that. The first time  nothing will happen  because the system has no idea how he thinks about  pull.  But maintain that thought for the entire duration of the eight seconds. So  one  two  three  go. Okay. So once we accept this  the cube is live. So let's see if Evan can actually try and imagine pulling. Ah  good job  That's really amazing. So we have a little bit of time available  so I'm going to ask Evan to do a really difficult task. And this one is difficult because it's all about being able to visualize something that doesn't exist in our physical world. This is  disappear.  So what you want to do    at least with movement based actions  we do that all the time  so you can visualize it. But with  disappear   there's really no analogies    so Evan  what you want to do here is to imagine the cube slowly fading out  okay. Same sort of drill. So  one  two  three  go. Okay. Let's try that. Oh  my goodness. He's just too good. Let's try that again. EG  Losing concentration. TL  But we can see that it actually works  even though you can only hold it for a little bit of time. As I said  it's a very difficult process to imagine this. And the great thing about it is that we've only given the software one instance of how he thinks about  disappear.  As there is a machine learning algorithm in this    Thank you. Good job. Good job. Thank you  Evan  you're a wonderful  wonderful example of the technology. So  as you can see  before  there is a leveling system built into this software so that as Evan  or any user  becomes more familiar with the system  they can continue to add more and more detections  so that the system begins to differentiate between different distinct thoughts. And once you've trained up the detections  these thoughts can be assigned or mapped to any computing platform  application or device. So I'd like to show you a few examples  because there are many possible applications for this new interface. In games and virtual worlds  for example  your facial expressions can naturally and intuitively be used to control an avatar or virtual character. Obviously  you can experience the fantasy of magic and control the world with your mind. And also  colors  lighting  sound and effects can dynamically respond to your emotional state to heighten the experience that you're having  in real time. And moving on to some applications developed by developers and researchers around the world  with robots and simple machines  for example    in this case  flying a toy helicopter simply by thinking  lift  with your mind. The technology can also be applied to real world applications    in this example  a smart home. You know  from the user interface of the control system to opening curtains or closing curtains. And of course  also to the lighting    turning them on or off. And finally  to real life changing applications  such as being able to control an electric wheelchair. In this example  facial expressions are mapped to the movement commands. Man  Now blink right to go right. Now blink left to turn back left. Now smile to go straight. TL  We really    Thank you. We are really only scratching the surface of what is possible today  and with the community's input  and also with the involvement of developers and researchers from around the world  we hope that you can help us to shape where the technology goes from here. Thank you so much. So let me just start with my story. So I tore my knee joint meniscus cartilage playing soccer in college. Then I went on to tear my ACL  the ligament in my knee  and then developed an arthritic knee. And I'm sure that many of you in this audience have that same story  and  by the way  I married a woman who has exactly the same story. So this motivated me to become an orthopedic surgeon and to see if I couldn't focus on solutions for those problems that would keep me playing sports and not limit me. So with that  let me just show you a quick video to get you in the mood of what we're trying to explain. Narrator  We are all aware of the risk of cancer  but there's another disease that's destined to affect even more of us  arthritis. Cancer may kill you  but when you look at the numbers  arthritis ruins more lives. Assuming you live a long life  there's a    percent chance you'll develop arthritis. And it's not just aging that causes arthritis. Common injuries can lead to decades of pain  until our joints quite literally grind to a halt. Desperate for a solution  we've turned to engineering to design artificial components to replace our worn out body parts  but in the midst of the modern buzz around the promises of a bionic body  shouldn't we stop and ask if there's a better  more natural way  Let's consider an alternative path. What if all the replacements our bodies need already exist in nature  or within our own stem cells  This is the field of biologic replacements  where we replace worn out parts with new  natural ones. Kevin Stone  And so  the mission is  how do I treat these things biologically  And let's talk about both what I did for my wife  and what I've done for hundreds of other patients. First thing for my wife  and the most common thing I hear from my patients  particularly in the     to    year old age group     year old age group  is they come in and say   Hey  Doc  isn't there just a shock absorber you can put in my knee  I'm not ready for joint replacement.  And so for her  I put in a human meniscus allograft donor right into that  knee  joint space. And  the allograft  replaces  the missing meniscus . And then for that unstable ligament  we put in a human donor ligament to stabilize the knee. And then for the damaged arthritis on the surface  we did a stem cell paste graft  which we designed in       to regrow that articular cartilage surface and give it back a smooth surface there. So here's my wife's bad knee on the left  and her just hiking now four months later in Aspen  and doing well. And it works  not just for my wife  but certainly for other patients. The girl on the video  Jen Hudak  just won the Superpipe in Aspen just nine months after having destroyed her knee  as you see in the other image    and having a paste graft to that knee. And so we can regrow these surfaces biologically. So with all this success  why isn't that good enough  you might ask. Well the reason is because there's not enough donor cycles. There's not enough young  healthy people falling off their motorcycle and donating that tissue to us. And the tissue's very expensive. And so that's not going to be a solution that's going to get us global with biologic tissue. But the solution is animal tissue because it's plentiful  it's cheap  you can get it from young  healthy tissues  but the barrier is immunology. And the specific barrier is a specific epitope called the galactosyl  or gal epitope. So if we're going to transplant animal tissues to people  we have to figure out a way to get rid of that epitope. So my story in working with animal tissues starts in     . And I started first with cow Achilles tendon  where we would take the cow Achilles tendon  which is type I collagen  strip it of its antigens by degrading it with an acid and detergent wash and forming it into a regeneration template. We would then take that regeneration template and insert it into the missing meniscus cartilage to regrow that in a patient's knee. We've now done that procedure  and it's been done worldwide in over       cases  so it's an FDA approved and worldwide accepted way to regrow the meniscus. And that's great when I can degrade the tissue. But what happens for your ligament when I need an intact ligament  I can't grind it up in a blender. So in that case  I have to design    and we designed with Uri Galili and Tom Turek    an enzyme wash to wash away  or strip  those galactosyl epitopes with a specific enzyme. And we call that a  gal stripping  technique. What we do is humanize the tissue. It's by gal stripping that tissue we humanize it  Laughter   and then we can put it back into a patient's knee. And we've done that. Now we've taken pig ligament    young  healthy  big tissue  put it into    patients in an FDA approved trial    and then one of our patients went on to have three Canadian Masters Downhill championships    on his  pig lig   as he calls it. So we know it can work. And there's a wide clinical trial of this tissue now pending. So what about the next step  What about getting to a total biologic knee replacement  not just the parts  How are we going to revolutionize artificial joint replacement  Well here's how we're going to do it. So what we're going to do is take an articular cartilage from a young  healthy pig  strip it of its antigens  load it with your stem cells  then put it back on to that arthritic surface in your knee  tack it on there  have you heal that surface and then create a new biologic surface for your knee. So that's our biologic approach right now. We're going to rebuild your knee with the parts. We're going to resurface it with a completely new surface. But we have other advantages from the animal kingdom. There's a benefit of     million years of ambulation. We can harness those benefits. We can use thicker  younger  better tissues than you might have injured in your knee  or that you might have when you're        or   . We can do it as an outpatient procedure. We can strip that tissue very economically  and so this is how we can get biologic knee replacement to go global. And so welcome to super biologics. It's not hardware. It's not software. It's bioware. It's version  .  of you. And so with that  coming to a    coming to an operating theater near you soon  I believe. Thank you very much. Today  I'm going to take you around the world in    minutes. My base of operations is in the U.S.  but let's start at the other end of the map  in Kyoto  Japan  where I was living with a Japanese family while I was doing part of my dissertational research    years ago. I knew even then that I would encounter cultural differences and misunderstandings  but they popped up when I least expected it. On my first day  I went to a restaurant  and I ordered a cup of green tea with sugar. After a pause  the waiter said   One does not put sugar in green tea.   I know   I said.  I'm aware of this custom. But I really like my tea sweet.  In response  he gave me an even more courteous version of the same explanation.  One does not put sugar in green tea.   I understand   I said   that the Japanese do not put sugar in their green tea  but I'd like to put some sugar in my green tea.  Surprised by my insistence  the waiter took up the issue with the manager. Pretty soon  a lengthy discussion ensued  and finally the manager came over to me and said   I am very sorry. We do not have sugar.  Well  since I couldn't have my tea the way I wanted it  I ordered a cup of coffee  which the waiter brought over promptly. Resting on the saucer were two packets of sugar. My failure to procure myself a cup of sweet  green tea was not due to a simple misunderstanding. This was due to a fundamental difference in our ideas about choice. From my American perspective  when a paying customer makes a reasonable request based on her preferences  she has every right to have that request met. The American way  to quote Burger King  is to  have it your way   because  as Starbucks says   happiness is in your choices.  But from the Japanese perspective  it's their duty to protect those who don't know any better    in this case  the ignorant gaijin    from making the wrong choice. Let's face it  the way I wanted my tea was inappropriate according to cultural standards  and they were doing their best to help me save face. Americans tend to believe that they've reached some sort of pinnacle in the way they practice choice. They think that choice  as seen through the American lens best fulfills an innate and universal desire for choice in all humans. Unfortunately  these beliefs are based on assumptions that don't always hold true in many countries  in many cultures. At times they don't even hold true at America's own borders. I'd like to discuss some of these assumptions and the problems associated with them. As I do so  I hope you'll start thinking about some of your own assumptions and how they were shaped by your backgrounds. First assumption  if a choice affects you  then you should be the one to make it. This is the only way to ensure that your preferences and interests will be most fully accounted for. It is essential for success. In America  the primary locus of choice is the individual. People must choose for themselves  sometimes sticking to their guns  regardless of what other people want or recommend. It's called  being true to yourself.  But do all individuals benefit from taking such an approach to choice  Mark Lepper and I did a series of studies in which we sought the answer to this very question. In one study  which we ran in Japantown  San Francisco  we brought seven  to nine year old Anglo  and Asian American children into the laboratory  and we divided them up into three groups. The first group came in  and they were greeted by Miss Smith  who showed them six big piles of anagram puzzles. The kids got to choose which pile of anagrams they would like to do  and they even got to choose which marker they would write their answers with. When the second group of children came in  they were brought to the same room  shown the same anagrams  but this time Miss Smith told them which anagrams to do and which markers to write their answers with. Now when the third group came in  they were told that their anagrams and their markers had been chosen by their mothers. In reality  the kids who were told what to do  whether by Miss Smith or their mothers  were actually given the very same activity  which their counterparts in the first group had freely chosen. With this procedure  we were able to ensure that the kids across the three groups all did the same activity  making it easier for us to compare performance. Such small differences in the way we administered the activity yielded striking differences in how well they performed. Anglo Americans  they did two and a half times more anagrams when they got to choose them  as compared to when it was chosen for them by Miss Smith or their mothers. It didn't matter who did the choosing  if the task was dictated by another  their performance suffered. In fact  some of the kids were visibly embarrassed when they were told that their mothers had been consulted. One girl named Mary said   You asked my mother   In contrast  Asian American children performed best when they believed their mothers had made the choice  second best when they chose for themselves  and least well when it had been chosen by Miss Smith. A girl named Natsumi even approached Miss Smith as she was leaving the room and tugged on her skirt and asked   Could you please tell my mommy I did it just like she said   The first generation children were strongly influenced by their immigrant parents' approach to choice. For them  choice was not just a way of defining and asserting their individuality  but a way to create community and harmony by deferring to the choices of people whom they trusted and respected. If they had a concept of being true to one's self  then that self  most likely   was  composed  not of an individual  but of a collective. Success was just as much about pleasing key figures as it was about satisfying one's own preferences. Or  you could say that the individual's preferences were shaped by the preferences of specific others. The assumption then that we do best when the individual self chooses only holds when that self is clearly divided from others. When  in contrast  two or more individuals see their choices and their outcomes as intimately connected  then they may amplify one another's success by turning choosing into a collective act. To insist that they choose independently might actually compromise both their performance and their relationships. Yet that is exactly what the American paradigm demands. It leaves little room for interdependence or an acknowledgment of individual fallibility. It requires that everyone treat choice as a private and self defining act. People that have grown up in such a paradigm might find it motivating  but it is a mistake to assume that everyone thrives under the pressure of choosing alone. The second assumption which informs the American view of choice goes something like this. The more choices you have  the more likely you are to make the best choice. So bring it on  Walmart  with         different products  and Amazon  with    million books and Match.com with    what is it        million date possibilities now. You will surely find the perfect match. Let's test this assumption by heading over to Eastern Europe. Here  I interviewed people who were residents of formerly communist countries  who had all faced the challenge of transitioning to a more democratic and capitalistic society. One of the most interesting revelations came not from an answer to a question  but from a simple gesture of hospitality. When the participants arrived for their interview  I offered them a set of drinks  Coke  Diet Coke  Sprite    seven  to be exact. During the very first session  which was run in Russia  one of the participants made a comment that really caught me off guard.  Oh  but it doesn't matter. It's all just soda. That's just one choice.  I was so struck by this comment that from then on  I started to offer all the participants those seven sodas  and I asked them   How many choices are these   Again and again  they perceived these seven different sodas  not as seven choices  but as one choice  soda or no soda. When I put out juice and water in addition to these seven sodas  now they perceived it as only three choices    juice  water and soda. Compare this to the die hard devotion of many Americans  not just to a particular flavor of soda  but to a particular brand. You know  research shows repeatedly that we can't actually tell the difference between Coke and Pepsi. Of course  you and I know that Coke is the better choice. For modern Americans who are exposed to more options and more ads associated with options than anyone else in the world  choice is just as much about who they are as it is about what the product is. Combine this with the assumption that more choices are always better  and you have a group of people for whom every little difference matters and so every choice matters. But for Eastern Europeans  the sudden availability of all these consumer products on the marketplace was a deluge. They were flooded with choice before they could protest that they didn't know how to swim. When asked   What words and images do you associate with choice   Grzegorz from Warsaw said   Ah  for me it is fear. There are some dilemmas you see. I am used to no choice.  Bohdan from Kiev said  in response to how he felt about the new consumer marketplace   It is too much. We do not need everything that is there.  A sociologist from the Warsaw Survey Agency explained   The older generation jumped from nothing to choice all around them. They were never given a chance to learn how to react.  And Tomasz  a young Polish man said   I don't need twenty kinds of chewing gum. I don't mean to say that I want no choice  but many of these choices are quite artificial.  In reality  many choices are between things that are not that much different. The value of choice depends on our ability to perceive differences between the options. Americans train their whole lives to play  spot the difference.  They practice this from such an early age that they've come to believe that everyone must be born with this ability. In fact  though all humans share a basic need and desire for choice  we don't all see choice in the same places or to the same extent. When someone can't see how one choice is unlike another  or when there are too many choices to compare and contrast  the process of choosing can be confusing and frustrating. Instead of making better choices  we become overwhelmed by choice  sometimes even afraid of it. Choice no longer offers opportunities  but imposes constraints. It's not a marker of liberation  but of suffocation by meaningless minutiae. In other words  choice can develop into the very opposite of everything it represents in America when it is thrust upon those who are insufficiently prepared for it. But it is not only other people in other places that are feeling the pressure of ever increasing choice. Americans themselves are discovering that unlimited choice seems more attractive in theory than in practice. We all have physical  mental and emotional  Laughter  limitations that make it impossible for us to process every single choice we encounter  even in the grocery store  let alone over the course of our entire lives. A number of my studies have shown that when you give people    or more options when they're making a choice  they make poorer decisions  whether it be health care  investment  other critical areas. Yet still  many of us believe that we should make all our own choices and seek out even more of them. This brings me to the third  and perhaps most problematic  assumption   You must never say no to choice.  To examine this  let's go back to the U.S. and then hop across the pond to France. Right outside Chicago  a young couple  Susan and Daniel Mitchell  were about to have their first baby. They'd already picked out a name for her  Barbara  after her grandmother. One night  when Susan was seven months pregnant  she started to experience contractions and was rushed to the emergency room. The baby was delivered through a C section  but Barbara suffered cerebral anoxia  a loss of oxygen to the brain. Unable to breathe on her own  she was put on a ventilator. Two days later  the doctors gave the Mitchells a choice  They could either remove Barbara off the life support  in which case she would die within a matter of hours  or they could keep her on life support  in which case she might still die within a matter of days. If she survived  she would remain in a permanent vegetative state  never able to walk  talk or interact with others. What do they do  What do any parent do  In a study I conducted with Simona Botti and Kristina Orfali  American and French parents were interviewed. They had all suffered the same tragedy. In all cases  the life support was removed  and the infants had died. But there was a big difference. In France  the doctors decided whether and when the life support would be removed  while in the United States  the final decision rested with the parents. We wondered  does this have an effect on how the parents cope with the loss of their loved one  We found that it did. Even up to a year later  American parents were more likely to express negative emotions  as compared to their French counterparts. French parents were more likely to say things like   Noah was here for so little time  but he taught us so much. He gave us a new perspective on life.  American parents were more likely to say things like   What if  What if   Another parent complained   I feel as if they purposefully tortured me. How did they get me to do that   And another parent said   I feel as if I've played a role in an execution.  But when the American parents were asked if they would rather have had the doctors make the decision  they all said   No.  They could not imagine turning that choice over to another  even though having made that choice made them feel trapped  guilty  angry. In a number of cases they were even clinically depressed. These parents could not contemplate giving up the choice  because to do so would have gone contrary to everything they had been taught and everything they had come to believe about the power and purpose of choice. In her essay   The White Album   Joan Didion writes   We tell ourselves stories in order to live. We interpret what we see  select the most workable of the multiple choices. We live entirely by the imposition of a narrative line upon disparate images  by the idea with which we have learned to freeze the shifting phantasmagoria  which is our actual experience.  The story Americans tell  the story upon which the American dream depends  is the story of limitless choice. This narrative promises so much  freedom  happiness  success. It lays the world at your feet and says   You can have anything  everything.  It's a great story  and it's understandable why they would be reluctant to revise it. But when you take a close look  you start to see the holes  and you start to see that the story can be told in many other ways. Americans have so often tried to disseminate their ideas of choice  believing that they will be  or ought to be  welcomed with open hearts and minds. But the history books and the daily news tell us it doesn't always work out that way. The phantasmagoria  the actual experience that we try to understand and organize through narrative  varies from place to place. No single narrative serves the needs of everyone everywhere. Moreover  Americans themselves could benefit from incorporating new perspectives into their own narrative  which has been driving their choices for so long. Robert Frost once said that   It is poetry that is lost in translation.  This suggests that whatever is beautiful and moving  whatever gives us a new way to see  cannot be communicated to those who speak a different language. But Joseph Brodsky said that   It is poetry that is gained in translation   suggesting that translation can be a creative  transformative act. When it comes to choice  we have far more to gain than to lose by engaging in the many translations of the narratives. Instead of replacing one story with another  we can learn from and revel in the many versions that exist and the many that have yet to be written. No matter where we're from and what your narrative is  we all have a responsibility to open ourselves up to a wider array of what choice can do  and what it can represent. And this does not lead to a paralyzing moral relativism. Rather  it teaches us when and how to act. It brings us that much closer to realizing the full potential of choice  to inspiring the hope and achieving the freedom that choice promises but doesn't always deliver. If we learn to speak to one another  albeit through translation  then we can begin to see choice in all its strangeness  complexity and compelling beauty. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Thank you. Sheena  there is a detail about your biography that we have not written in the program book. But by now it's evident to everyone in this room. You're blind. And I guess one of the questions on everybody's mind is  How does that influence your study of choosing because that's an activity that for most people is associated with visual inputs like aesthetics and color and so on  Sheena Iyengar  Well  it's funny that you should ask that because one of the things that's interesting about being blind is you actually get a different vantage point when you observe the way sighted people make choices. And as you just mentioned  there's lots of choices out there that are very visual these days. Yeah  I    as you would expect    get pretty frustrated by choices like what nail polish to put on because I have to rely on what other people suggest. And I can't decide. And so one time I was in a beauty salon  and I was trying to decide between two very light shades of pink. And one was called  Ballet Slippers.  And the other one was called  Adorable.  And so I asked these two ladies  and the one lady told me   Well  you should definitely wear 'Ballet Slippers.'   Well  what does it look like    Well  it's a very elegant shade of pink.   Okay  great.  The other lady tells me to wear  Adorable.   What does it look like    It's a glamorous shade of pink.  And so I asked them   Well  how do I tell them apart  What's different about them   And they said   Well  one is elegant  the other one's glamorous.  Okay  we got that. And the only thing they had consensus on  well  if I could see them  I would clearly be able to tell them apart. And what I wondered was whether they were being affected by the name or the content of the color  so I decided to do a little experiment. So I brought these two bottles of nail polish into the laboratory  and I stripped the labels off. And I brought women into the laboratory  and I asked them   Which one would you pick      percent of the women accused me of playing a trick  of putting the same color nail polish in both those bottles. At which point you start to wonder who the trick's really played on. Now  of the women that could tell them apart  when the labels were off  they picked  Adorable   and when the labels were on  they picked  Ballet Slippers.  So as far as I can tell  a rose by any other name probably does look different and maybe even smells different. BG  Thank you. Sheena Iyengar. Thank you Sheena. For a moment  what I need to do is project something on the screen of your imagination. We're in   th century Japan on the west coast  and a little  wizened monk is hurrying along  near midnight  to the crest of a small hill. He arrives on the small hill  dripping with water. He stands there  and he looks across at the island  Sado. And he scans across the ocean  and he looks at the sky. Then he says to himself  very quietly    Turbulent the sea    Stretching across to Sado   The Milky Way .  Basho was a brilliant man. He said more with less than any human that I have ever read or talked to. Basho  in    syllables  juxtaposed a turbulent ocean driven by a storm now past  and captured the almost impossible beauty of our home galaxy with millions of stars  probably hundreds and hundreds of    who knows how many    planets  maybe even an ocean that we will probably call Sylvia in time. As he was nearing his death  his disciples and followers kept asking him   What's the secret  How can you make haiku poems so beautiful so easily   And toward the end  he said   If you would know the pine tree  go to the pine tree.  That was it. Sylvia has said we must use every capacity we have in order to know the oceans. If we would know the oceans  we must go to the oceans. And what I'd like to talk to you today about  a little bit  is really transforming the relationship  or the interplay  between humans and oceans with a new capability that is not at all routine yet. I hope it will be. There are a few key points. One of them is the oceans are central to the quality of life on earth. Another is that there are bold  new ways of studying oceans that we have not used well yet. And the last is that these bold  new ways that we are exploring as a community will transform the way we look at our planet  our oceans  and eventually how we manage probably the entire planet  for what it's worth. So what scientists do when they begin is to start with the system. They define what the system is. The system isn't Chesapeake Bay. It's not the Kuril arc. It's not even the entire Pacific. It's the whole planet  the entire planet  continents and oceans together. That's the system. And basically  our challenge is to optimize the benefits and mitigate the risks of living on a planet that's driven by only two processes  two sources of energy  one of which is solar  that drives the winds  the waves  the clouds  the storms and photosynthesis. The second one is internal energy. And these two war against one another almost continuously. Mountain ranges  plate tectonics  moves the continents around  forms ore deposits. Volcanoes erupt. That's the planet that we live on. It's immensely complex. Now I don't expect all of you to see all the details here  but what I want you to see is this is about    percent of the processes that operate within the oceans almost continuously  and have for the last   billion years. This is a system that's been around a very long time. And these have all co evolved. What do I mean by that  They interact with one another constantly. All of them interact with one another. So the complexity of this system that we're looking at  the one driven by the sun    upper portion  mostly    and the lower portion is partly driven by the input from heat below and by other processes. This is very  very important because this is the system  this is the crucible  out of which life on the planet came  and it's now time for us to understand it. We must understand it. That's one of the themes that Sylvia reminds us about  understand this ocean of ours  this basic life support system  the dominant life support system on the planet. Look at this complexity here. This is only one variable. If you can see the complexity  you can see how tiny  little eddies and large eddies and the motion    this is just sea surface temperature  but it's immensely complicated. Now a layer in  the other two or three hundred processes that are all interacting  partly as a function of temperature  partly as a function of all the other factors  and you've got a really complicated system. That's our challenge  is to understand  understand this system in new and phenomenal ways. And there's an urgency to this. Part of the urgency comes from the fact that  of order  a billion people on the planet currently are undernourished or starving. And part of the issue is for Cody    who's here     years old    and I have permission to relay this number. When he     years from now  is the age of Nancy Brown  there are going to be another two and a half billion people on the planet. We can't solve all the problems by looking only at the oceans  but if we don't understand the fundamental life support system of this planet much more thoroughly than we do now  then the stresses that we will face  and that Cody will face  and even Nancy  who's going to live till she's     will have really problems coping. All right  let's talk about another perspective on the importance of the oceans. Look at this diagram  which is showing warm waters in red  cool waters in blue  and on the continents  what you're seeing in bright green  is the growth of vegetation  and in olive green  the dieback of vegetation. And in the lower left hand corner there's a clock ticking away from      to      and then cycling again. What you'll see is that the rhythms of growth  of vegetation    a subset of which is food on the continents    is directly tied to the rhythms of the sea surface temperatures. The oceans control  or at least significantly influence  correlate with  the growth patterns and the drought patterns and the rain patterns on the continents. So people in Kansas  in a wheat field in Kansas  need to understand that the oceans are central to them as well. Another complexity  this is the age of the oceans. I'm going to layer in on top of this the tectonic plates. The age of the ocean  the tectonic plates  gives rise to a totally new phenomenon that we have heard about in this conference. And I share with you some very high definition video that we collected in real time. Seconds after this video was taken  people in Beijing  people in Sydney  people in Amsterdam  people in Washington D.C. were watching this. Now you've heard of hydrothermal vents  but the other discovery is that deep below the sea floor  there is vast reservoir of microbial activity  which we have only just discovered and we have almost no way to study. Some people have estimated that the biomass tied up in these microbes living in the pours and the cracks of the sea floor and below rival the total amount of living biomass at the surface of the planet. It's an astonishing insight  and we have only found out about this recently. This is very  very exciting. It may be the next rainforest  in terms of pharmaceuticals. We know little or nothing about it. Well  Marcel Proust has this wonderful saying that   The real voyage of discovery consists not so much in seeking new territory  but possibly in having new sets of eyes   new ways of seeing things  a new mindset. And many of you remember the early stages of oceanography  when we had to use what we had at our fingertips. And it wasn't easy. It wasn't easy in those days. Some of you remember this  I'm sure. And now  we have an entire suite of tools that are really pretty powerful    ships  satellites  moorings. But they don't quite cut it. They don't quite give us what we need. And the program that I wanted to talk to you about just a little bit here  was funded  and it involves autonomous vehicles like the one running across the base of this image. Modeling  on the right hand side  there's a very complex computational model. On the left hand side  there's a new type of mooring  which I'll show you in just a second. And on the basis of several points  the oceans are complex  and they're central to the life on earth. They are changing rapidly  but not predictably. And the models that we need to predict the future do not have enough data to refine them. The computational power is amazing. But without data  those models will never ever be predicted. And that's what we really need. For a variety of reasons they're dangerous  but we feel that OOI  this Ocean Observatory Initiative  which the National Science Foundation has begun to fund  has the potential to really transform things. And the goal of the program is to launch an era of scientific discovery and understanding across and within the ocean basins  utilizing widely accessible  interactive telepresence. It's a new world. We will be present throughout the volume of the ocean  at will  communicating in real time. And this is what the system involves  a number of sites in the southern hemisphere  shown in those circles. And in the northern hemisphere there are four sites. I won't talk a lot about most of them right here  but the one on the west coast  that's in the box  is called the regional scale nodes. It was once called Neptune. And let me show you what's behind it. Fiber  next generation way of communicating. You can see the copper tips on these things. You can transmit power  but the bandwidth is in those tiny  little threads smaller than the hair on your head in diameter. And this particular set here can transmit something of the order of three to five terabits per second. This is phenomenal bandwidth. And this is what the planet looks like. We are already laced up as if we're in a fiber optic corset  if you like. This is what it looks like. And the cables go really continent to continent. It's a very powerful system  and most of our communications consist of it. So this is the system that I'm talking about  off the west coast. It's coincident with the tectonic plate  the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate. And it's going to deliver abundant power and unprecedented bandwidth across this entire volume    in the overlying ocean  on the sea floor and below the sea floor. Bandwidth and power and a wide variety of processes that will be operating. This is what one of those primary nodes looks like  and it's like a sub station with power and bandwidth that can spread out over an area the size of Seattle. And the kind of science that can be done will be determined by a variety of scientists who want to be involved and can bring the instrumentation to the table. They will bring it and link it in. It'll be  in a sense  like having time on a telescope  except you'll have your own port. Climate change  ocean acidification  dissolved oxygen  carbon cycle  coastal upwelling  fishing dynamics    the full spectrum of earth science and ocean science simultaneously in the same volume. So anyone coming along later simply accesses the database and can draw down the information they need about anything that has taken place. And this is just the first of these. In conjunction with our Canadian colleagues  we've set this up. Now I want to take you into the caldera. On the left hand side there is a large volcano called Axial Seamount. And we're going to go down into the Axial Seamount using animation. Here's what this system is going to look like that we are funded to build at this point. Very powerful. That's an elevator that's constantly moving up and down  but it can be controlled by the folks on land who are responsible for it. Or they can transfer control to someone in India or China who can take over for a while  because it's all going to be directly connected through the Internet. There will be massive amounts of data flowing ashore  all available to anyone who has any interest in using it. This is going to be much more powerful than having a single ship in a single location  then move to a new location. We're flying across the caldera floor. There is a number of robotic systems. There's cameras that can be turned on and off at your will  if those are your experiments. The kinds of systems that will be down there  the kinds of instruments that will be on the sea floor  consist of    if you can read them there    there's cameras  there's pressure sensors  fluorometers  there's seismometers. It's a full spectrum of tools. Now  that mound right there actually looks like this. This is what it actually looks like. And this is the kind of activity that we can see with high definition video  because the bandwidth of these cables is so huge that we could have five to    stereo HD systems running continuously and  again  directed through robotic techniques from land. Very  very powerful. And these are the things that we're funded to do today. So what can we actually do tomorrow  We're about to ride the wave of technological opportunity. There are emerging technologies throughout the field around oceanography  which we will incorporate into oceanography  and through that convergence  we will transform oceanography into something even more magical. Robotics systems are just incredible these days  absolutely incredible. And we will be bringing robotics of all sorts into the ocean. Nanotechnology  this is a small generator. It's smaller than a postage stamp  and it can generate power just by being attached to your shirt as you move. Just as you move  it generates power. There are many kinds of things that can be used in the ocean  continuously. Imaging  Many of you know a good deal more about this type of thing than I  but stereo imaging at four times the definition that we have in HD will be routine within five years. And this is the magic one. As a result of the human genome process  we are in a situation where events that take place in the ocean    like an erupting volcano  or something of that sort    can actually be sampled. We pump the fluid through one of these systems  and we press the button  and it's analyzed for the genomic character. And that's transmitted back to land immediately. So in the volume of the ocean  we will know  not just the physics and the chemistry  but the base of the food chain will be transparent to us with data on a continuous basis. Grid computing  the power of grid computers is going to be just amazing here. We will soon be using grid computing to do pretty much everything  like adjust the data and everything that goes with the data. The power generation will come from the ocean itself. And the next generation fiber will be simply magic. It's far beyond what we currently have. So the presence of the power and the bandwidth in the environment will allow all of these new technologies to converge in a manner that is just unprecedented. So within five to seven years  I see us having a capacity to be completely present throughout the ocean and have all of that connected to the Internet  so we can reach many  many folks. Delivering the power and the bandwidth into the ocean will dramatically accelerate adaptation. Here's an example. When earthquakes take place  massive amounts of these new microbes we've never seen before come out of the sea floor. We have a way of addressing that  a new way of addressing that. We've determined from the earthquake activity that you're seeing here that the top of that volcano is erupting  so we deploy the troops. What are the troops  The troops are the autonomous vehicles  of course. And they fly into the erupting volcano. They sample the fluids coming out of the sea floor during an eruption  which have the microbes that have never been to the surface of the planet before. They eject it to the surface where it floats  and it is picked up by an autonomous airplane  and it's brought back to the laboratory within    hours of the eruption. This is doable. All the pieces are there. A laboratory  many of you heard what happened on    . Some doctors in New York City removed the gallbladder of a woman in France. We could do work on the sea floor that would be stunning  and it would be on live TV  if we have interesting things to show. So we can bring an entirely new telepresence to the world  throughout the ocean. This    I've shown you sea floor    but so the goal here is real time interaction with the oceans from anywhere on earth. It's going to be amazing. And as I go here  I just want to show you what we can bring into classrooms  and indeed  what we can bring into your pocket. Many of you don't think of this yet  but the ocean will be in your pocket. It won't be long. It won't be long. So let me leave you then with a few words from another poet  if you'll forgive me. In       T.S. Eliot wrote the  Four Quartets.  He won the Nobel Prize for literature in     . In  Little Gidding  he says    speaking I think for the human race  but certainly for the TED Conference and Sylvia     We shall not cease from exploration  and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time  arrive through the unknown remembered gate where the last of earth left to discover is that which was the beginning. At the source of the longest river the voice of a hidden waterfall not known because not looked for  but heard  half heard in the stillness beneath the waves of the sea.  Thank you. I want to start my talk today with two observations about the human species. The first observation is something that you might think is quite obvious  and that's that our species  Homo sapiens  is actually really  really smart    like  ridiculously smart    like you're all doing things that no other species on the planet does right now. And this is  of course  not the first time you've probably recognized this. Of course  in addition to being smart  we're also an extremely vain species. So we like pointing out the fact that we're smart. You know  so I could turn to pretty much any sage from Shakespeare to Stephen Colbert to point out things like the fact that we're noble in reason and infinite in faculties and just kind of awesome er than anything else on the planet when it comes to all things cerebral. But of course  there's a second observation about the human species that I want to focus on a little bit more  and that's the fact that even though we're actually really smart  sometimes uniquely smart  we can also be incredibly  incredibly dumb when it comes to some aspects of our decision making. Now I'm seeing lots of smirks out there. Don't worry  I'm not going to call anyone in particular out on any aspects of your own mistakes. But of course  just in the last two years we see these unprecedented examples of human ineptitude. And we've watched as the tools we uniquely make to pull the resources out of our environment kind of just blow up in our face. We've watched the financial markets that we uniquely create    these markets that were supposed to be foolproof    we've watched them kind of collapse before our eyes. But both of these two embarrassing examples  I think  don't highlight what I think is most embarrassing about the mistakes that humans make  which is that we'd like to think that the mistakes we make are really just the result of a couple bad apples or a couple really sort of FAIL Blog worthy decisions. But it turns out  what social scientists are actually learning is that most of us  when put in certain contexts  will actually make very specific mistakes. The errors we make are actually predictable. We make them again and again. And they're actually immune to lots of evidence. When we get negative feedback  we still  the next time we're face with a certain context  tend to make the same errors. And so this has been a real puzzle to me as a sort of scholar of human nature. What I'm most curious about is  how is a species that's as smart as we are capable of such bad and such consistent errors all the time  You know  we're the smartest thing out there  why can't we figure this out  In some sense  where do our mistakes really come from  And having thought about this a little bit  I see a couple different possibilities. One possibility is  in some sense  it's not really our fault. Because we're a smart species  we can actually create all kinds of environments that are super  super complicated  sometimes too complicated for us to even actually understand  even though we've actually created them. We create financial markets that are super complex. We create mortgage terms that we can't actually deal with. And of course  if we are put in environments where we can't deal with it  in some sense makes sense that we actually might mess certain things up. If this was the case  we'd have a really easy solution to the problem of human error. We'd actually just say  okay  let's figure out the kinds of technologies we can't deal with  the kinds of environments that are bad    get rid of those  design things better  and we should be the noble species that we expect ourselves to be. But there's another possibility that I find a little bit more worrying  which is  maybe it's not our environments that are messed up. Maybe it's actually us that's designed badly. This is a hint that I've gotten from watching the ways that social scientists have learned about human errors. And what we see is that people tend to keep making errors exactly the same way  over and over again. It feels like we might almost just be built to make errors in certain ways. This is a possibility that I worry a little bit more about  because  if it's us that's messed up  it's not actually clear how we go about dealing with it. We might just have to accept the fact that we're error prone and try to design things around it. So this is the question my students and I wanted to get at. How can we tell the difference between possibility one and possibility two  What we need is a population that's basically smart  can make lots of decisions  but doesn't have access to any of the systems we have  any of the things that might mess us up    no human technology  human culture  maybe even not human language. And so this is why we turned to these guys here. These are one of the guys I work with. This is a brown capuchin monkey. These guys are New World primates  which means they broke off from the human branch about    million years ago. This means that your great  great  great great  great  great    with about five million  greats  in there    grandmother was probably the same great  great  great  great grandmother with five million  greats  in there as Holly up here. You know  so you can take comfort in the fact that this guy up here is a really really distant  but albeit evolutionary  relative. The good news about Holly though is that she doesn't actually have the same kinds of technologies we do. You know  she's a smart  very cut creature  a primate as well  but she lacks all the stuff we think might be messing us up. So she's the perfect test case. What if we put Holly into the same context as humans  Does she make the same mistakes as us  Does she not learn from them  And so on. And so this is the kind of thing we decided to do. My students and I got very excited about this a few years ago. We said  all right  let's  you know  throw so problems at Holly  see if she messes these things up. First problem is just  well  where should we start  Because  you know  it's great for us  but bad for humans. We make a lot of mistakes in a lot of different contexts. You know  where are we actually going to start with this  And because we started this work around the time of the financial collapse  around the time when foreclosures were hitting the news  we said  hhmm  maybe we should actually start in the financial domain. Maybe we should look at monkey's economic decisions and try to see if they do the same kinds of dumb things that we do. Of course  that's when we hit a sort second problem    a little bit more methodological    which is that  maybe you guys don't know  but monkeys don't actually use money. I know  you haven't met them. But this is why  you know  they're not in the queue behind you at the grocery store or the ATM    you know  they don't do this stuff. So now we faced  you know  a little bit of a problem here. How are we actually going to ask monkeys about money if they don't actually use it  So we said  well  maybe we should just  actually just suck it up and teach monkeys how to use money. So that's just what we did. What you're looking at over here is actually the first unit that I know of of non human currency. We weren't very creative at the time we started these studies  so we just called it a token. But this is the unit of currency that we've taught our monkeys at Yale to actually use with humans  to actually buy different pieces of food. It doesn't look like much    in fact  it isn't like much. Like most of our money  it's just a piece of metal. As those of you who've taken currencies home from your trip know  once you get home  it's actually pretty useless. It was useless to the monkeys at first before they realized what they could do with it. When we first gave it to them in their enclosures  they actually kind of picked them up  looked at them. They were these kind of weird things. But very quickly  the monkeys realized that they could actually hand these tokens over to different humans in the lab for some food. And so you see one of our monkeys  Mayday  up here doing this. This is A and B are kind of the points where she's sort of a little bit curious about these things    doesn't know. There's this waiting hand from a human experimenter  and Mayday quickly figures out  apparently the human wants this. Hands it over  and then gets some food. It turns out not just Mayday  all of our monkeys get good at trading tokens with human salesman. So here's just a quick video of what this looks like. Here's Mayday. She's going to be trading a token for some food and waiting happily and getting her food. Here's Felix  I think. He's our alpha male  he's a kind of big guy. But he too waits patiently  gets his food and goes on. So the monkeys get really good at this. They're surprisingly good at this with very little training. We just allowed them to pick this up on their own. The question is  is this anything like human money  Is this a market at all  or did we just do a weird psychologist's trick by getting monkeys to do something  looking smart  but not really being smart. And so we said  well  what would the monkeys spontaneously do if this was really their currency  if they were really using it like money  Well  you might actually imagine them to do all the kinds of smart things that humans do when they start exchanging money with each other. You might have them start paying attention to price  paying attention to how much they buy    sort of keeping track of their monkey token  as it were. Do the monkeys do anything like this  And so our monkey marketplace was born. The way this works is that our monkeys normally live in a kind of big zoo social enclosure. When they get a hankering for some treats  we actually allowed them a way out into a little smaller enclosure where they could enter the market. Upon entering the market    it was actually a much more fun market for the monkeys than most human markets because  as the monkeys entered the door of the market  a human would give them a big wallet full of tokens so they could actually trade the tokens with one of these two guys here    two different possible human salesmen that they could actually buy stuff from. The salesmen were students from my lab. They dressed differently  they were different people. And over time  they did basically the same thing so the monkeys could learn  you know  who sold what at what price    you know  who was reliable  who wasn't  and so on. And you can see that each of the experimenters is actually holding up a little  yellow food dish. and that's what the monkey can for a single token. So everything costs one token  but as you can see  sometimes tokens buy more than others  sometimes more grapes than others. So I'll show you a quick video of what this marketplace actually looks like. Here's a monkey eye view. Monkeys are shorter  so it's a little short. But here's Honey. She's waiting for the market to open a little impatiently. All of a sudden the market opens. Here's her choice  one grapes or two grapes. You can see Honey  very good market economist  goes with the guy who gives more. She could teach our financial advisers a few things or two. So not just Honey  most of the monkeys went with guys who had more. Most of the monkeys went with guys who had better food. When we introduced sales  we saw the monkeys paid attention to that. They really cared about their monkey token dollar. The more surprising thing was that when we collaborated with economists to actually look at the monkeys' data using economic tools  they basically matched  not just qualitatively  but quantitatively with what we saw humans doing in a real market. So much so that  if you saw the monkeys' numbers  you couldn't tell whether they came from a monkey or a human in the same market. And what we'd really thought we'd done is like we'd actually introduced something that  at least for the monkeys and us  works like a real financial currency. Question is  do the monkeys start messing up in the same ways we do  Well  we already saw anecdotally a couple of signs that they might. One thing we never saw in the monkey marketplace was any evidence of saving    you know  just like our own species. The monkeys entered the market  spent their entire budget and then went back to everyone else. The other thing we also spontaneously saw  embarrassingly enough  is spontaneous evidence of larceny. The monkeys would rip off the tokens at every available opportunity    from each other  often from us    you know  things we didn't necessarily think we were introducing  but things we spontaneously saw. So we said  this looks bad. Can we actually see if the monkeys are doing exactly the same dumb things as humans do  One possibility is just kind of let the monkey financial system play out  you know  see if they start calling us for bailouts in a few years. We were a little impatient so we wanted to sort of speed things up a bit. So we said  let's actually give the monkeys the same kinds of problems that humans tend to get wrong in certain kinds of economic challenges  or certain kinds of economic experiments. And so  since the best way to see how people go wrong is to actually do it yourself  I'm going to give you guys a quick experiment to sort of watch your own financial intuitions in action. So imagine that right now I handed each and every one of you a thousand U.S. dollars    so    crisp hundred dollar bills. Take these  put it in your wallet and spend a second thinking about what you're going to do with it. Because it's yours now  you can buy whatever you want. Donate it  take it  and so on. Sounds great  but you get one more choice to earn a little bit more money. And here's your choice  you can either be risky  in which case I'm going to flip one of these monkey tokens. If it comes up heads  you're going to get a thousand dollars more. If it comes up tails  you get nothing. So it's a chance to get more  but it's pretty risky. Your other option is a bit safe. Your just going to get some money for sure. I'm just going to give you     bucks. You can stick it in your wallet and use it immediately. So see what your intuition is here. Most people actually go with the play it safe option. Most people say  why should I be risky when I can get       dollars for sure  This seems like a good bet. I'm going to go with that. You might say  eh  that's not really irrational. People are a little risk averse. So what  Well  the  so what   comes when start thinking about the same problem set up just a little bit differently. So now imagine that I give each and every one of you       dollars       crisp hundred dollar bills. Now you can buy double to stuff you were going to get before. Think about how you'd feel sticking it in your wallet. And now imagine that I have you make another choice But this time  it's a little bit worse. Now  you're going to be deciding how you're going to lose money  but you're going to get the same choice. You can either take a risky loss    so I'll flip a coin. If it comes up heads  you're going to actually lose a lot. If it comes up tails  you lose nothing  you're fine  get to keep the whole thing    or you could play it safe  which means you have to reach back into your wallet and give me five of those      bills  for certain. And I'm seeing a lot of furrowed brows out there. So maybe you're having the same intuitions as the subjects that were actually tested in this  which is when presented with these options  people don't choose to play it safe. They actually tend to go a little risky. The reason this is irrational is that we've given people in both situations the same choice. It's a       shot of a thousand or        or just       dollars with certainty. But people's intuitions about how much risk to take varies depending on where they started with. So what's going on  Well  it turns out that this seems to be the result of at least two biases that we have at the psychological level. One is that we have a really hard time thinking in absolute terms. You really have to do work to figure out  well  one option's a thousand         one is      . Instead  we find it very easy to think in very relative terms as options change from one time to another. So we think of things as   Oh  I'm going to get more   or  Oh  I'm going to get less.  This is all well and good  except that changes in different directions actually effect whether or not we think options are good or not. And this leads to the second bias  which economists have called loss aversion. The idea is that we really hate it when things go into the red. We really hate it when we have to lose out on some money. And this means that sometimes we'll actually switch our preferences to avoid this. What you saw in that last scenario is that subjects get risky because they want the small shot that there won't be any loss. That means when we're in a risk mindset    excuse me  when we're in a loss mindset  we actually become more risky  which can actually be really worrying. These kinds of things play out in lots of bad ways in humans. They're why stock investors hold onto losing stocks longer    because they're evaluating them in relative terms. They're why people in the housing market refused to sell their house    because they don't want to sell at a loss. The question we were interested in is whether the monkeys show the same biases. If we set up those same scenarios in our little monkey market  would they do the same thing as people  And so this is what we did  we gave the monkeys choices between guys who were safe    they did the same thing every time    or guys who were risky    they did things differently half the time. And then we gave them options that were bonuses    like you guys did in the first scenario    so they actually have a chance more  or pieces where they were experiencing losses    they actually thought they were going to get more than they really got. And so this is what this looks like. We introduced the monkeys to two new monkey salesmen. The guy on the left and right both start with one piece of grape  so it looks pretty good. But they're going to give the monkeys bonuses. The guy on the left is a safe bonus. All the time  he adds one  to give the monkeys two. The guy on the right is actually a risky bonus. Sometimes the monkeys get no bonus    so this is a bonus of zero. Sometimes the monkeys get two extra. For a big bonus  now they get three. But this is the same choice you guys just faced. Do the monkeys actually want to play it safe and then go with the guy who's going to do the same thing on every trial  or do they want to be risky and try to get a risky  but big  bonus  but risk the possibility of getting no bonus. People here played it safe. Turns out  the monkeys play it safe too. Qualitatively and quantitatively  they choose exactly the same way as people  when tested in the same thing. You might say  well  maybe the monkeys just don't like risk. Maybe we should see how they do with losses. And so we ran a second version of this. Now  the monkeys meet two guys who aren't giving them bonuses  they're actually giving them less than they expect. So they look like they're starting out with a big amount. These are three grapes  the monkey's really psyched for this. But now they learn these guys are going to give them less than they expect. They guy on the left is a safe loss. Every single time  he's going to take one of these away and give the monkeys just two. the guy on the right is the risky loss. Sometimes he gives no loss  so the monkeys are really psyched  but sometimes he actually gives a big loss  taking away two to give the monkeys only one. And so what do the monkeys do  Again  same choice  they can play it safe for always getting two grapes every single time  or they can take a risky bet and choose between one and three. The remarkable thing to us is that  when you give monkeys this choice  they do the same irrational thing that people do. They actually become more risky depending on how the experimenters started. This is crazy because it suggests that the monkeys too are evaluating things in relative terms and actually treating losses differently than they treat gains. So what does all of this mean  Well  what we've shown is that  first of all  we can actually give the monkeys a financial currency  and they do very similar things with it. They do some of the smart things we do  some of the kind of not so nice things we do  like steal it and so on. But they also do some of the irrational things we do. They systematically get things wrong and in the same ways that we do. This is the first take home message of the Talk  which is that if you saw the beginning of this and you thought  oh  I'm totally going to go home and hire a capuchin monkey financial adviser. They're way cuter than the one at ... you know    Don't do that  they're probably going to be just as dumb as the human one you already have. So  you know  a little bad    Sorry  sorry  sorry. A little bad for monkey investors. But of course  you know  the reason you're laughing is bad for humans too. Because we've answered the question we started out with. We wanted to know where these kinds of errors came from. And we started with the hope that maybe we can sort of tweak our financial institutions  tweak our technologies to make ourselves better. But what we've learn is that these biases might be a deeper part of us than that. In fact  they might be due to the very nature of our evolutionary history. You know  maybe it's not just humans at the right side of this chain that's duncey. Maybe it's sort of duncey all the way back. And this  if we believe the capuchin monkey results  means that these duncey strategies might be    million years old. That's a long time for a strategy to potentially get changed around    really  really old. What do we know about other old strategies like this  Well  one thing we know is that they tend to be really hard to overcome. You know  think of our evolutionary predilection for eating sweet things  fatty things like cheesecake. You can't just shut that off. You can't just look at the dessert cart as say   No  no  no. That looks disgusting to me.  We're just built differently. We're going to perceive it as a good thing to go after. My guess is that the same thing is going to be true when humans are perceiving different financial decisions. When you're watching your stocks plummet into the red  when you're watching your house price go down  you're not going to be able to see that in anything but old evolutionary terms. This means that the biases that lead investors to do badly  that lead to the foreclosure crisis are going to be really hard to overcome. So that's the bad news. The question is  is there any good news  I'm supposed to be up here telling you the good news. Well  the good news  I think  is what I started with at the beginning of the Talk  which is that humans are not only smart  we're really inspirationally smart to the rest of the animals in the biological kingdom. We're so good at overcoming our biological limitations    you know  I flew over here in an airplane. I didn't have to try to flap my wings. I'm wearing contact lenses now so that I can see all of you. I don't have to rely on my own near sightedness. We actually have all of these cases where we overcome our biological limitations through technology and other means  seemingly pretty easily. But we have to recognize that we have those limitations. And here's the rub. It was Camus who once said that   Man is the only species who refuses to be what he really is.  But the irony is that it might only be in recognizing our limitations that we can really actually overcome them. The hope is that you all will think about your limitations  not necessarily as unovercomable  but to recognize them  accept them and then use the world of design to actually figure them out. That might be the only way that we will really be able to achieve our own human potential and really be the noble species we hope to all be. Thank you. Last year when I was here  I was speaking to you about a swim which I did across the North Pole. And while that swim took place three years ago  I can remember it as if it was yesterday. I remember standing on the edge of the ice  about to dive into the water  and thinking to myself  I have never ever seen any place on this earth which is just so frightening. The water is completely black. The water is minus  .  degrees centigrade  or    degrees Fahrenheit. It's flipping freezing in that water. And then a thought came across my mind  if things go pear shaped on this swim  how long will it take for my frozen body to sink the four and a half kilometers to the bottom of the ocean  And then I said to myself  I've just got to get this thought out of my mind as quickly as possible. And the only way I can dive into that freezing cold water and swim a kilometer is by listening to my iPod and really revving myself up  listening to everything from beautiful opera all the way across to Puff Daddy  and then committing myself a hundred percent    there is nothing more powerful than the made up mind    and then walking up to the edge of the ice and just diving into the water. And that swim took me    minutes and    seconds  and it felt like    days. And I remember getting out of the water and my hands feeling so painful and looking down at my fingers  and my fingers were literally the size of sausages because    you know  we're made partially of water    when water freezes it expands  and so the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded and burst. And the most immediate thought when I came out of that water was the following  I'm never  ever going to do another cold water swim in my life again. Anyway  last year  I heard about the Himalayas and the melting of the     Laughter  and the melting of the glaciers because of climate change. I heard about this lake  Lake Imja. This lake has been formed in the last couple of years because of the melting of the glacier. The glacier's gone all the way up the mountain and left in its place this big lake. And I firmly believe that what we're seeing in the Himalayas is the next great  big battleground on this earth. Nearly two billion people    so one in three people on this earth    rely on the water from the Himalayas. And with a population increasing as quickly as it is  and with the water supply from these glaciers    because of climate change    decreasing so much  I think we have a real risk of instability. North  you've got China  south  you've India  Pakistan  Bangladesh  all these countries. And so I decided to walk up to Mt. Everest  the highest mountain on this earth  and go and do a symbolic swim underneath the summit of Mt. Everest. Now  I don't know if any of you have had the opportunity to go to Mt. Everest  but it's quite an ordeal getting up there.    great  big  powerful yaks carrying all the equipment up onto this mountain    I don't just have my Speedo  but there's a big film crew who then send all the images around the world. The other thing which was so challenging about this swim is not just the altitude. I wanted to do the swim at       meters above sea level. So it's right up in the heavens. It's very  very difficult to breath. You get altitude sickness. I feels like you've got a man standing behind you with a hammer just hitting your head all the time. That's not the worst part of it. The worst part was this year was the year where they decided to do a big cleanup operation on Mt. Everest. Many  many people have died on Mt. Everest  and this was the year they decided to go and recover all the bodies of the mountaineers and then bring them down the mountain. And when you're walking up the mountain to attempt to do something which no human has ever done before  and  in fact  no fish    there are no fish up there swimming at       meters    When you're trying to do that  and then the bodies are coming past you  it humbles you  and you also realize very  very clearly that nature is so much more powerful than we are. And we walked up this pathway  all the way up. And to the right hand side of us was this great Khumbu Glacier. And all the way along the glacier we saw these big pools of melting ice. And then we got up to this small lake underneath the summit of Mt. Everest  and I prepared myself the same way as I've always prepared myself  for this swim which was going to be so very difficult. I put on my iPod  I listened to some music  I got myself as aggressive as possible    but controlled aggression    and then I hurled myself into that water. I swam as quickly as I could for the first hundred meters  and then I realized very  very quickly  I had a huge problem on my hands. I could barely breathe. I was gasping for air. I then began to choke  and then it quickly led to me vomiting in the water. And it all happened so quickly  I then    I don't know how it happened    but I went underwater. And luckily  the water was quite shallow  and I was able to push myself off the bottom of the lake and get up and then take another gasp of air. And then I said  carry on. Carry on. Carry on. I carried on for another five or six strokes  and then I had nothing in my body  and I went down to the bottom of the lake. And I don't where I got it from  but I was able to somehow pull myself up and as quickly as possible get to the side of the lake. I've heard it said that drowning is the most peaceful death that you can have. I have never  ever heard such utter bollocks. It is the most frightening and panicky feeling that you can have. I got myself to the side of the lake. My crew grabbed me  and then we walked as quickly as we could down    over the rubble    down to our camp. And there  we sat down  and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong there on Mt. Everest. And my team just gave it to me straight. They said  Lewis  you need to have a radical tactical shift if you want to do this swim. Every single thing which you have learned in the past    years of swimming  you must forget. Every single thing which you learned when you were serving in the British army  about speed and aggression  you put that to one side. We want you to walk up the hill in another two days' time. Take some time to rest and think about things. We want you to walk up the mountain in two days' time  and instead of swimming fast  swim as slowly as possible. Instead of swimming crawl  swim breaststroke. And remember  never ever swim with aggression. This is the time to swim with real humility. And so we walked back up to the mountain two days later. And I stood there on the edge of the lake  and I looked up at Mt. Everest    and she is one of the most beautiful mountains on the earth    and I said to myself  just do this slowly. And I swam across the lake. And I can't begin to tell you how good I felt when I came to the other side. But I learned two very  very important lessons there on Mt. Everest  and I thank my team of Sherpas who taught me this. The first one is that just because something has worked in the past so well  doesn't mean it's going to work in the future. And similarly  now  before I do anything  I ask myself what type of mindset do I require to successfully complete a task. And taking that into the world of climate change    which is  frankly  the Mt. Everest of all problems    just because we've lived the way we have lived for so long  just because we have consumed the way we have for so long and populated the earth the way we have for so long  doesn't mean that we can carry on the way we are carrying on. The warning signs are all there. When I was born  the world's population was  .  billion people. We're now  .  billion people  and we're expected to be   billion people by     . And then the second lesson  the radical  tactical shift. And I've come here to ask you today  what radical tactical shift can you take in your relationship to the environment  which will ensure that our children and our grandchildren live in a safe world and a secure world  and most importantly  in a sustainable world  And I ask you  please  to go away from here and think about that one radical tactical shift which you could make  which will make that big difference  and then commit a hundred percent to doing it. Blog about it  tweet about it  talk about it  and commit a hundred percent  because very  very few things are impossible to achieve if we really put our whole minds to it. So thank you very  very much. I grew up on a small farm in Missouri. We lived on less than a dollar a day for about    years. I got a scholarship  went to university  studied international agriculture  studied anthropology  and decided I was going to give back. I was going to work with small farmers. I was going to help alleviate poverty. I was going to work on international development  and then I took a turn and ended up here. Now  if you get a Ph.D.  and you decide not to teach  you don't always end up in a place like this. It's a choice. You might end up driving a taxicab. You could be in New York. What I found was  I started working with refugees and famine victims    small farmers  all  or nearly all    who had been dispossessed and displaced. Now  what I'd been trained to do was methodological research on such people. So I did it  I found out how many women had been raped en route to these camps. I found out how many people had been put in jail  how many family members had been killed. I assessed how long they were going to stay and how much it would take to feed them. And I got really good at predicting how many body bags you would need for the people who were going to die in these camps. Now this is God's work  but it's not my work. It's not the work I set out to do. So I was at a Grateful Dead benefit concert on the rainforests in     . I met a guy    the guy on the left. His name was Ben. He said   What can I do to save the rainforests   I said   Well  Ben  what do you do    I make ice cream.  So I said   Well  you've got to make a rainforest ice cream. And you've got to use nuts from the rainforests to show that forests are worth more as forests than they are as pasture.  He said   Okay.  Within a year  Rainforest Crunch was on the shelves. It was a great success. We did our first million dollars worth of trade by buying on    days and selling on   . That gets your adrenaline going. Then we had a four and a half million dollar line of credit because we were credit worthy at that point. We had    to     maybe    percent of the global Brazil nut market. We paid two to three times more than anybody else. Everybody else raised their prices to the gatherers of Brazil nuts because we would buy it otherwise. A great success.    companies signed up      products came out  generated     million in sales. It failed. Why did it fail  Because the people who were gathering Brazil nuts weren't the same people who were cutting the forests. And the people who made money from Brazil nuts were not the people who made money from cutting the forests. We were attacking the wrong driver. We needed to be working on beef. We needed to be working on lumber. We needed to be working on soy    things that we were not focused on. So let's go back to Sudan. I often talk to refugees   Why was it that the West didn't realize that famines are caused by policies and politics  not by weather   And this farmer said to me  one day  something that was very profound. He said   You can't wake a person who's pretending to sleep.  Okay. Fast forward. We live on a planet. There's just one of them. We've got to wake up to the fact that we don't have any more and that this is a finite planet. We know the limits of the resources we have. We may be able to use them differently. We may have some innovative  new ideas. But in general  this is what we've got. There's no more of it. There's a basic equation that we can't get away from. Population times consumption has got to have some kind of relationship to the planet  and right now  it's a simple  not equal.  Our work shows that we're living at about  .  planets. Since       we crossed the line of being in a sustainable relationship to the planet. Now we're at  . . If we were farmers  we'd be eating our seed. For bankers  we'd be living off the principal  not the interest. This is where we stand today. A lot of people like to point to some place else as the cause of the problem. It's always population growth. Population growth's important  but it's also about how much each person consumes. So when the average American consumes    times as much as the average African  we've got to think that consumption is an issue. It's not just about population  and it's not just about them  it's about us. But it's not just about people  it's about lifestyles. There's very good evidence    again  we don't necessarily have a peer reviewed methodology that's bulletproof yet    but there's very good evidence that the average cat in Europe has a larger environmental footprint in its lifetime than the average African. You think that's not an issue going forward  You think that's not a question as to how we should be using the Earth's resources  Let's go back and visit our equation. In       we had six billion people on the planet. They were consuming what they were consuming    let's say one unit of consumption each. We have six billion units of consumption. By       we're going to have nine billion people    all the scientists agree. They're all going to consume twice as much as they currently do    scientists  again  agree    because income is going to grow in developing countries five times what it is today    on global average  about   .  . So we're going to have    billion units of consumption. Who have you heard talking lately that's said we have to triple production of goods and services  But that's what the math says. We're not going to be able to do that. We can get productivity up. We can get efficiency up. But we've also got to get consumption down. We need to use less to make more. And then we need to use less again. And then we need to consume less. All of those things are part of that equation. But it basically raises a fundamental question  should consumers have a choice about sustainability  about sustainable products  Should you be able to buy a product that's sustainable sitting next to one that isn't  or should all the products on the shelf be sustainable  If they should all be sustainable on a finite planet  how do you make that happen  The average consumer takes  .  seconds in the U.S. Okay  so let's be generous. Let's say it's  .  seconds in Europe. How do you evaluate all the scientific data around a product  the data that's changing on a weekly  if not a daily  basis  How do you get informed  You don't. Here's a little question. From a greenhouse gas perspective  is lamb produced in the U.K. better than lamb produced in New Zealand  frozen and shipped to the U.K.  Is a bad feeder lot operation for beef better or worse than a bad grazing operation for beef  Do organic potatoes actually have fewer toxic chemicals used to produce them than conventional potatoes  In every single case  the answer is  it depends.  It depends on who produced it and how  in every single instance. And there are many others. How is a consumer going to walk through this minefield  They're not. They may have a lot of opinions about it  but they're not going to be terribly informed. Sustainability has got to be a pre competitive issue. It's got to be something we all care about. And we need collusion. We need groups to work together that never have. We need Cargill to work with Bunge. We need Coke to work with Pepsi. We need Oxford to work with Cambridge. We need Greenpeace to work with WWF. Everybody's got to work together    China and the U.S. We need to begin to manage this planet as if our life depended on it  because it does  it fundamentally does. But we can't do everything. Even if we get everybody working on it  we've got to be strategic. We need to focus on the where  the what and the who. So  the where  We've identified    places globally that we need to work. These are the places that are the richest in biodiversity and the most important from an ecosystem function point of view. We have to work in these places. We have to save these places if we want a chance in hell of preserving biodiversity as we know it. We looked at the threats to these places. These are the    commodities that fundamentally pose the biggest threats to these places because of deforestation  soil loss  water use  pesticide use  over fishing  etc. So we've got    places  we've got    priority commodities  who do we work with to change the way those commodities are produced  Are we going to work with  .  billion consumers  Let's see  that's about       languages      major languages    a lot of work there. I don't see anybody actually being able to do that very effectively. Are we going to work with  .  billion producers  Again  a daunting task. There must be a better way.     to     companies control    percent or more of the trade of each of the    commodities that we've identified as the most significant. If we work with those  if we change those companies and the way they do business  then the rest will happen automatically. So  we went through our    commodities. This is nine of them. We lined them up side by side  and we put the names of the companies that work on each of those. And if you go through the first    or    names of each of the commodities  what you begin to see is  gosh  there's Cargill here  there's Cargill there  there's Cargill everywhere. In fact  these names start coming up over and over again. So we did the analysis again a slightly different way. We said  if we take the top hundred companies  what percentage of all    commodities do they touch  buy or sell  And what we found is it's    percent. So     companies control    percent of the trade of all    of the most significant commodities on the planet. We can get our arms around a hundred companies. A hundred companies  we can work with. Why is    percent important  Because if these companies demand sustainable products  they'll pull    to    percent of production. Companies can push producers faster than consumers can. By companies asking for this  we can leverage production so much faster than by waiting for consumers to do it. After    years  the global organic movement has achieved  .  of one percent of global food. We can't wait that long. We don't have that kind of time. We need change that's going to accelerate. Even working with individual companies is not probably going to get us there. We need to begin to work with industries. So we've started roundtables where we bring together the entire value chain  from producers all the way to the retailers and brands. We bring in civil society  we bring in NGOs  we bring in researchers and scientists to have an informed discussion    sometimes a battle royale    to figure out what are the key impacts of these products  what is a global benchmark  what's an acceptable impact  and design standards around that. It's not all fun and games. In salmon aquaculture  we kicked off a roundtable almost six years ago. Eight entities came to the table. We eventually got  I think     percent of global production at the table and    percent of demand at the table. Three of the original eight entities were suing each other. And yet  next week  we launch globally verified  vetted and certified standards for salmon aquaculture. It can happen. So what brings the different entities to the table  It's risk and demand. For the big companies  it's reputational risk  but more importantly  they don't care what the price of commodities is. If they don't have commodities  they don't have a business. They care about availability  so the big risk for them is not having product at all. For the producers  if a buyer wants to buy something produced a certain way  that's what brings them to the table. So it's the demand that brings them to the table. The good news is we identified a hundred companies two years ago. In the last    months  we've signed agreements with    of those hundred companies to begin to work with them on their supply chain. And in the next    months  we will have signed up to work with another     and we think we'll get those signed as well. Now what we're doing is bringing the CEOs of these    companies together to help twist the arms of the final     to bring them to the table  because they don't like NGOs  they've never worked with NGOs  they're concerned about this  they're concerned about that  but we all need to be in this together. So we're pulling out all the stops. We're using whatever leverage we have to bring them to the table. One company we're working with that's begun    in baby steps  perhaps    but has begun this journey on sustainability is Cargill. They've funded research that shows that we can double global palm oil production without cutting a single tree in the next    years  and do it all in Borneo alone by planting on land that's already degraded. The study shows that the highest net present value for palm oil is on land that's been degraded. They're also undertaking a study to look at all of their supplies of palm oil to see if they could be certified and what they would need to change in order to become third party certified under a credible certification program. Why is Cargill important  Because Cargill has    to    percent of global palm oil. If Cargill makes a decision  the entire palm oil industry moves  or at least    or    percent of it. That's not insignificant. More importantly  Cargill and one other company ship    percent of the palm oil that goes to China. We don't have to change the way a single Chinese company works if we get Cargill to only send sustainable palm oil to China. It's a pre competitive issue. All the palm oil going there is good. Buy it. Mars is also on a similar journey. Now most people understand that Mars is a chocolate company  but Mars has made sustainability pledges to buy only certified product for all of its seafood. It turns out Mars buys more seafood than Walmart because of pet food. But they're doing some really interesting things around chocolate  and it all comes from the fact that Mars wants to be in business in the future. And what they see is that they need to improve chocolate production. On any given plantation     percent of the trees produce    percent of the crop  so Mars is looking at the genome  they're sequencing the genome of the cocoa plant. They're doing it with IBM and the USDA  and they're putting it in the public domain because they want everybody to have access to this data  because they want everybody to help them make cocoa more productive and more sustainable. What they've realized is that if they can identify the traits on productivity and drought tolerance  they can produce     percent as much cocoa on    percent of the land. The rest of the land can be used for something else. It's more with less and less again. That's what the future has got to be  and putting it in the public domain is smart. They don't want to be an I.P. company  they want to be a chocolate company  but they want to be a chocolate company forever. Now  the price of food  many people complain about  but in fact  the price of food is going down  and that's odd because in fact  consumers are not paying for the true cost of food. If you take a look just at water  what we see is that  with four very common products  you look at how much a farmer produced to make those products  and then you look at how much water input was put into them  and then you look at what the farmer was paid. If you divide the amount of water into what the farmer was paid  the farmer didn't receive enough money to pay a decent price for water in any of those commodities. That is an externality by definition. This is the subsidy from nature. Coca Cola  they've worked a lot on water  but right now  they're entering into    year contracts with growers in Turkey to sell juice into Europe  and they're doing that because they want to have a product that's closer to the European market. But they're not just buying the juice  they're also buying the carbon in the trees to offset the shipment costs associated with carbon to get the product into Europe. There's carbon that's being bought with sugar  with coffee  with beef. This is called bundling. It's bringing those externalities back into the price of the commodity. We need to take what we've learned in private  voluntary standards of what the best producers in the world are doing and use that to inform government regulation  so we can shift the entire performance curve. We can't just focus on identifying the best  we've got to move the rest. The issue isn't what to think  it's how to think. These companies have begun to think differently. They're on a journey  there's no turning back. We're all on that same journey with them. We have to really begin to change the way we think about everything. Whatever was sustainable on a planet of six billion is not going to be sustainable on a planet with nine. Thank you. The global challenge that I want to talk to you about today rarely makes the front pages. It  however  is enormous in both scale and importance. Look  you all are very well traveled  this is TEDGlobal after all. But I do hope to take you to some places you've never been to before. So  let's start off in China. This photo was taken two weeks ago. Actually  one indication is that little boy on my husband's shoulders has just graduated from high school. But this is Tiananmen Square. Many of you have been there. It's not the real China. Let me take you to the real China. This is in the Dabian Mountains in the remote part of Hubei province in central China. Dai Manju is    years old at the time the story starts. She lives with her parents  her two brothers and her great aunt. They have a hut that has no electricity  no running water  no wristwatch  no bicycle. And they share this great splendor with a very large pig. Dai Manju was in sixth grade when her parents said   We're going to pull you out of school because the    dollar school fees are too much for us. You're going to be spending the rest of your life in the rice paddies. Why would we waste this money on you   This is what happens to girls in remote areas. Turns out that Dai Manju was the best pupil in her grade. She still made the two hour trek to the schoolhouse and tried to catch every little bit of information that seeped out of the doors. We wrote about her in The New York Times. We got a flood of donations    mostly    dollar checks because New York Times readers are very generous in tiny amounts but then  we got a money transfer for            really nice guy. We turned the money over to that man there  the principal of the school. He was delighted. He thought   Oh  I can renovate the school. I can give scholarships to all the girls  you know  if they work hard and stay in school. So Dai Manju basically finished out middle school. She went to high school. She went to vocational school for accounting. She scouted for jobs down in Guangdong province in the south. She found a job  she scouted for jobs for her classmates and her friends. She sent money back to her family. They built a new house  this time with running water  electricity  a bicycle  no pig. What we saw was a natural experiment. It is rare to get an exogenous investment in girls' education. And over the years  as we followed Dai Manju  we were able to see that she was able to move out of a vicious cycle and into a virtuous cycle. She not only changed her own dynamic  she changed her household  she changed her family  her village. The village became a real standout. Of course  most of China was flourishing at the time  but they were able to get a road built to link them up to the rest of China. And that brings me to my first major of two tenets of  Half the Sky.  And that is that the central moral challenge of this century is gender inequity. In the   th century  it was slavery. In the   th century  it was totalitarianism. The cause of our time is the brutality that so many people face around the world because of their gender. So some of you may be thinking   Gosh  that's hyperbole. She's exaggerating.  Well  let me ask you this question. How many of you think there are more males or more females in the world  Let me take a poll. How many of you think there are more males in the world  Hands up  please. How many of you think    a few    how many of you there are more females in the world  Okay  most of you. Well  you know this latter group  you're wrong. There are  true enough  in Europe and the West  when women and men have equal access to food and health care  there are more women  we live longer. But in most of the rest of the world  that's not the case. In fact  demographers have shown that there are anywhere between    million and     million missing females in the current population. And  you know  it happens for several reasons. For instance  in the last half century  more girls were discriminated to death than all the people killed on all the battlefields in the   th century. Sometimes it's also because of the sonogram. Girls get aborted before they're even born when there are scarce resources. This girl here  for instance  is in a feeding center in Ethiopia. The entire center was filled with girls like her. What's remarkable is that her brothers  in the same family  were totally fine. In India  in the first year of life  from zero to one  boy and girl babies basically survive at the same rate because they depend upon the breast  and the breast shows no son preference. From one to five  girls die at a    percent higher mortality rate than boys  in all of India. The second tenet of  Half the Sky  is that  let's put aside the morality of all the right and wrong of it all  and just on a purely practical level  we think that one of the best ways to fight poverty and to fight terrorism is to educate girls and to bring women into the formal labor force. Poverty  for instance. There are three reasons why this is the case. For one  overpopulation is one of the persistent causes of poverty. And you know  when you educate a boy  his family tends to have fewer kids  but only slightly. When you educate a girl  she tends to have significantly fewer kids. The second reason is it has to do with spending. It's kind of like the dirty  little secret of poverty  which is that  not only do poor people take in very little income  but also  the income that they take in  they don't spend it very wisely  and unfortunately  most of that spending is done by men. So research has shown  if you look at people who live under two dollars a day    one metric of poverty    two percent of that take home pay goes to this basket here  in education.    percent goes to a basket that is a combination of alcohol  tobacco  sugary drinks    and prostitution and festivals. If you just take four percentage points and put it into this basket  you would have a transformative effect. The last reason has to do with women being part of the solution  not the problem. You need to use scarce resources. It's a waste of resources if you don't use someone like Dai Manju. Bill Gates put it very well when he was traveling through Saudi Arabia. He was speaking to an audience much like yourselves. However  two thirds of the way there was a barrier. On this side was men  and then the barrier  and this side was women. And someone from this side of the room got up and said   Mr. Gates  we have here as our goal in Saudi Arabia to be one of the top    countries when it comes to technology. Do you think we'll make it   So Bill Gates  as he was staring out at the audience  he said   If you're not fully utilizing half the resources in your country  there is no way you will get anywhere near the top   .  So here is Bill of Arabia. So what would some of the specific challenges look like  I would say  on the top of the agenda is sex trafficking. And I'll just say two things about this. The slavery at the peak of the slave trade in the     s  there were about        slaves transported from Africa to the New World. Now  modern slavery  according to State Department rough statistics  there are about               times the number    that are trafficked across international borders. And that does not even include those that are trafficked within country borders  which is a substantial portion. And if you look at another factor  another contrast  a slave back then is worth about         in today's money. Today  you can buy a girl trafficked for a few hundred dollars  which means she's actually more disposable. But you know  there is progress being made in places like Cambodia and Thailand. We don't have to expect a world where girls are bought and sold or killed. The second item on the agenda is maternal mortality. You know  childbirth in this part of the world is a wonderful event. In Niger  one in seven women can expect to die during childbirth. Around the world  one woman dies every minute and a half from childbirth. You know  it's not as though we don't have the technological solution  but these women have three strikes against them  they are poor  they are rural and they are female. You know  for every woman who does die  there are    who survive but end up with an injury. And the most devastating injury is obstetric fistula. It's a tearing during obstructed labor that leaves a woman incontinent. Let me tell you about Mahabuba. She lives in Ethiopia. She was married against her will at age   . She got pregnant  ran to the bush to have the baby  but you know  her body was very immature  and she ended up having obstructed labor. The baby died  and she ended up with a fistula. So that meant she was incontinent  she couldn't control her wastes. In a word  she stank. The villagers thought she was cursed  they didn't know what to do with her. So finally  they put her at the edge of the village in a hut. They ripped off the door so that the hyenas would get her at night. That night  there was a stick in the hut. She fought off the hyenas with that stick. And the next morning  she knew if she could get to a nearby village where there was a foreign missionary  she would be saved. Because she had some damage to her nerves  she crawled all the way       miles    to that doorstep  half dead. The foreign missionary opened the door  knew exactly what had happened  took her to a nearby fistula hospital in Addis Ababa  and she was repaired with a     dollar operation. The doctors and nurses there noticed that she was not only a survivor  she was really clever  and they made her a nurse. So now  Mahabuba  she is saving the lives of hundreds  thousands  of women. She has become part of the solution  not the problem. She's moved out of a vicious cycle and into a virtuous cycle. I've talked about some of the challenges  let me talk about some of the solutions  and there are predictable solutions. I've hinted at them  education and also economic opportunity. So of course  when you educate a girl  she tends to get married later on in life  she tends to have kids later on in life  she tends to have fewer kids  and those kids that she does have  she educates them in a more enlightened fashion. With economic opportunity  it can be transformative. Let me tell you about Saima. She lives in a small village outside Lahore  Pakistan. And at the time  she was miserable. She was beaten every single day by her husband  who was unemployed. He was kind of a gambler type    and unemployable  therefore    and took his frustrations out on her. Well  when she had her second daughter  her mother in law told her son   I think you'd better get a second wife. Saima's not going to produce you a son.  This is when she had her second daughter. At the time  there was a microlending group in the village that gave her a    dollar loan. Saima took that money  and she started an embroidery business. The merchants liked her embroidery  it sold very well  and they kept asking for more. And when she couldn't produce enough  she hired other women in the village. Pretty soon she had    women in the village working for her embroidery business. And then  when she had to transport all of the embroidery goods from the village to the marketplace  she needed someone to help her do the transport  so she hired her husband. So now they're in it together. He does the transportation and distribution  and she does the production and sourcing. And now they have a third daughter  and the daughters  all of them  are being tutored in education because Saima knows what's really important. Which brings me to the final element  which is education. Larry Summers  when he was chief economist at the World Bank  once said that   It may well be that the highest return on investment in the developing world is in girls' education.  Let me tell you about Beatrice Biira. Beatrice was living in Uganda near the Congo border  and like Dai Manju  she didn't go to school. Actually  she had never been to school  not to a lick  one day. Her parents  again  said   Why should we spend the money on her  She's going to spend most of her life lugging water back and forth.  Well  it just so happens  at that time  there was a group in Connecticut called the Niantic Community Church Group in Connecticut. They made a donation to an organization based in Arkansas called Heifer International. Heifer sent two goats to Africa. One of them ended up with Beatrice's parents  and that goat had twins. The twins started producing milk. They sold the milk for cash. The cash started accumulating  and pretty soon the parents said   You know  we've got enough money. Let's send Beatrice to school.  So at nine years of age  Beatrice started in first grade    after all  she'd never been to a lick of school    with a six year old. No matter  she was just delighted to be in school. She rocketed to the top of her class. She stayed at the top of her class through elementary school  middle school  and then in high school  she scored brilliantly on the national examinations so that she became the first person in her village  ever  to come to the United States on scholarship. Two years ago  she graduated from Connecticut College. On the day of her graduation  she said   I am the luckiest girl alive because of a goat.  And that goat was     . So you see how transformative little bits of help can be. But I want to give you a reality check. Look  U.S. aid  helping people is not easy  and there have been books that have criticized U.S. aid. There's Bill Easterly's book. There's a book called  Dead Aid.  You know  the criticism is fair  it isn't easy. You know  people say how half of all water well projects  a year later  are failed. When I was in Zimbabwe  we were touring a place with the village chief    he wanted to raise money for a secondary school    and there was some construction a few yards away  and I said   What's that   He sort of mumbled. Turns out that it's a failed irrigation project. A few yards away was a failed chicken coop. One year  all the chickens died  and no one wanted to put the chickens in there. It's true  but we think that you don't through the baby out with the bathwater  you actually improve. You learn from your mistakes  and you continuously improve. We also think that individuals can make a difference  and they should  because individuals  together  we can all help create a movement. And a movement of men and women is what's needed to bring about social change  change that will address this great moral challenge. So then  I ask  what's in it for you  You're probably asking that. Why should you care  I will just leave you with two things. One is that research shows that once you have all of your material needs taken care of    which most of us  all of us  here in this room do    research shows that there are very few things in life that can actually elevate your level of happiness. One of those things is contributing to a cause larger than yourself. And the second thing  it's an anecdote that I'll leave you with. And that is the story of an aid worker in Darfur. Here was a woman who had worked in Darfur  seeing things that no human being should see. Throughout her time there  she was strong  she was steadfast. She never broke down. And then she came back to the United States and was on break  Christmas break. She was in her grandmother's backyard  and she saw something that made her break down in tears. What that was was a bird feeder. And she realized that she had the great fortune to be born in a country where we take security for granted  where we not only can feed  clothe and house ourselves  but also provide for wild birds so they don't go hungry in the winter. And she realized that with that great fortune comes great responsibility. And so  like her  you  me  we have all won the lottery of life. And so the question becomes  how do we discharge that responsibility  So  here's the cause. Join the movement. Feel happier and help save the world. Thank you very much. When I saw a piece of technology called Kinect    it was called Natal    I was inspired  and I thought for a moment  maybe it's possible to address that one problem of storytelling  to create a character which seemed alive  which noticed me  that could look me in the eyes and feel real  and sculpt a story about our relationship. And so a year ago  I showed this off at a computer show called E . And this was a piece of technology with someone called Claire interacting with this boy. And there was a huge row online about   Hey  this can't be real.  And so I waited till now to have an actual demo of the real tech. Now  this tech incorporates three big elements. The first is a Kinect camera  which will be out in November  some incredible AI that was hidden in the dusty vaults  collecting dust in Microsoft  plus our quite crude attempts at AI at a company called Lionhead  mixing all those things together just to get to this one simple idea  to create a real  living being in a computer. Now  I'll be honest with you and say that most of it is just a trick  but it's a trick that actually works. So why don't we go over and have a look at the demo now. This is Dimitri. Dimitri  just waggle your arm around. Now  you notice he's sitting. There are no controllers  no keyboards  or mice  or joysticks  or joypads. He is just going to use his hand  his body and his voice  just like humans interact with their hands  body and voice. So let's move forward. You're going to meet Milo for the first time. We had to give him a problem because when we first created Milo  we realized that he came across as a little bit of a brat  to be honest with you. He was quite a know it all  and he wanted to kind of make you laugh. So the problem we introduced to him was this  he's just moved house. He's moved from London to New England  over in America. His parents are too busy to listen to his problems  and that's when he starts almost conjuring you up. So here he is walking through the grass. And you're able to interact with his world. The cool thing is  what we're doing is we're changing the mind of Milo constantly. That means no two people's Milos can be the same. You're actually sculpting a human being here. So  he's discovering the garden. You're helping him discover the garden by just pointing out these snails. Very simple at the start. By the way  if you are a boy  it's snails  if you're a girl  it's butterflies because what we found was that girls hate snails. So remember  this is the first time you've met him  and we really want to draw you in and make you more curious. His face  by the way  is fully AI driven. We have complete control over his blush responses  the diameter of his nostrils to denote stress. We actually do something called body matching. If you're leaning forward  he will try and slightly change the neuro linguistic nature of his face  because we went out with this strong idea  how can we make you believe that something's real  Now we've used the hand. The other thing to use is your body. Why not just  instead of pushing left and right with a mouse or with a joypad  why not use your body just to lean on the chair    again  relaxed  You can lean back  but the camera will change its perspective depending on which way you're looking. So Dimitri's now going to use    he's used his hand  he's used his body. He's now going to use the other thing which is essential  and that's his voice. Now  the thing about voice is  our experience with voice recognition is pretty awful  isn't it  It never works. You order an airline ticket  you end up in Timbuktu. So we've tackled that problem  and we've come up with a solution  which we'll see in a second. Milo  I could just squish it. Peter Molyneux  What are you going to do  Dimitri  Female Voice  Squashing a snail may not seem important  but remember  even this choice will affect how Milo develops. Do you want Milo to squash it  When you see the microphone  say ...  PM  Squash.  ... yes to decide. Dimitri  Go on  Milo. Squash it. PM  No. That's the wrong thing to do. Now look at his response. He said   Go on  Milo. Squash it.  What we're using there is  we're using something  a piece of technology called Tellme. It's a company that Microsoft acquired some years ago. We've got a database of words which we recognize. We pick those words out. We also reference that with the tonation database that we build up of Dimitri's voice  or the user's voice. Now we need to have a bit more engagement  and again  what we can do is we can look at the body. And we'll do that in a second. Milo  I wonder how deep it is. Deep. PM  Okay. So what we're going to do now is teach Milo to skim stones. We're actually teaching him. It's very  very interesting that men  more than women  tend to be more competitive here. They're fine with teaching Milo for the first few throws  but then they want to beat Milo  where women  they're more nurturing about this. Okay  this is skimming stones. How do you skim stones  You stand up  and you skim the stone. It's that simple. Just recognizing your body  recognizing the body's motions  the tech  understanding that you've gone from sitting down to standing up. Again  all of this is done in the way us humans do things  and that's crucially important if we want Milo to appear real. Female Voice  See if you can inspire him to do any better. Try hitting the boat. Milo  Ahhh. So close. PM  That's Dimitri at his most competitive. Now beaten an    year old child. Well done. Milo  Okay. PM  So  Milo's being called back in by his parents  giving us time to be alone and to help him out. Basically    the bit that we missed at the start    his parents had asked him to clean up his room. And we're going to help him with this now. But this is going to be an introduction  and this is all about the deep psychology that we're trying to use. We're trying to introduce you to what I believe is the most wonderful part  you being able to talk in your natural voice to Milo. Now  to do that  we needed a set up  like a magician's trick. And what we did was  we needed to give Milo this big problem. So as Dimitri starts tidying up  you can overhear a conversation that Milo's having with his parents. Milo's Mom  Oh  you've got gravy all over the floor.  Milo  I didn't mean to   Milo's Mom  That carpet is brand new. PM  So he's just spilled a plate of sausages on the floor  on the brand new carpet. We've all done it as parents  we've all done it as children. Now's a chance for Dimitri to kind of reassure and calm Milo down. It's all been too much for him. He's just moved house. He's got no friends. Now is the time when we open that portal and allow you to talk to Milo. Female Voice  Why don't you try saying something encouraging to cheer Milo up. Dimitri  Come on  Milo. You know what parents are like. They're always getting stressed. Milo  What do they want to come here for anyway  We don't know anyone. Dimitri  Well  you've got a new school to go to. You're going to meet loads of cool  new friends. Milo  I just really miss my old house  that's all. Dimitri  Well  this is a pretty awesome house  Milo. You've got a cool garden to play in and a pond. Milo  It was good skimming stones. This looks nice. You cleaned up my room. Thanks. PM  So after three quarters of an hour  he recognizes you. And I promise you  if you're sitting in front of this screen  that is a truly wonderful moment. And we're ready now to tell a story about his childhood and his life  and it goes on  and he has  you know  many adventures. Some of those adventures are a little bit dark or on the darker side. Some of those adventures are wonderfully encouraging    he's got to go to school. The cool thing is that we're doing as well  as you interact with him  you're able to put things into his world  he recognizes objects. His mind is based in a cloud. That means Milo's mind  as millions of people use it  will get smarter and cleverer. He'll recognize more objects and thus understand more words. But for me  this is a wonderful opportunity where technology  at last  can be connected with  where I am no longer restrained by the finger I hold in my hand    as far as a computer game's concerned    or by the blandness of not being noticed if you're watching a film or a book. And I love those revolutions  and I love the future that Milo brings. Thank you very much indeed. This talk is about righting writing wrongs. No  the sound's not faulty    righting writing wrongs. The Middle East is huge  and with all our problems  one thing's for sure  we love to laugh. I think humor is a great way to celebrate our differences. We need to take our responsibilities seriously  but not ourselves. Don't get me wrong  it's not like we don't have comedy in the Middle East. I grew up at a time when iconic actors from Kuwait  Syria  Egypt used laughter to unite the region  just as football can. Now is the time for us to laugh at ourselves  before others can laugh with us. This is the story of the rise and rise of stand up comedy in the Middle East    a stand up uprising  if you will. Working in London as TV maker and writer  I quickly realized that comedy connects audiences. Now  the best breeding ground for good comic writing is the stand up comedy circuit  where they just happen to say that you kill when you do well and you bomb when you do badly. An unfortunate connection for us maybe  but it reminds me that we'd like to thank one man for  over the past decade  working tirelessly to support comedians all around the world  specifically comedians with a Middle Eastern background. Like my good friends  Dean and Maysoon  at the bottom of the screen  who  two years after       started a festival to change the way Middle Easterners are perceived in the world. It's still going strong  with positive press to die for. Also  three guys working for years in Los Angeles  an Iranian  a Palestinian and an Egyptian  created the aptly named Axis of Evil comedy act. And wherever they went  they killed. Now  I didn't start this fire  but I did pour petrol on it. I moved to Dubai as the head of original content for a Western TV network. My job was to connect the brand with a Middle Eastern audience. Now  the American head of programming wanted new local Arabic comedy. In a thick Arabic accent  my brain went   Berfect.  Now  I had friends in the U.S. who had started a successful new tribe. And I had every intention of taking this tribe from being outliers in the Middle East and pushing them over the tipping point towards success. Now  as with any new idea  it wasn't easy. I had four phases to this plan. First  we'd need to buy content from the West and air it. Then I'd bring my friends  and we'd show local amateurs how it's done. We would film that and air it  and then I could work with the local amateurs and write new comedy. I excitedly presented this to the big boss  and his reaction was   Um  I don't get it.  So I retreated back to my cave and continued to support and produce comedy and let my friends use my couch as a regional operations hub. Now  fast forward two years  to early     . The earth rotated  as did our management  and as if by divine intervention  things came together to help this revolution take shape. Here's how the dots connected. First  the Axis guys recorded a Comedy Central special that aired in the States  and it was getting great hits on YouTube. Our new French CEO believed in the power of positive PR ... and ideas du bon marche. Let's just say  value for money.  I produced in Dubai a show for Ahmed Ahmed to showcase his new Axis special to a packed room. I invited our new CEO  and as soon as he realized we had a room packed full of laughing infidels  his reaction was very simple   Let's make this happen. And one more thing  No  don't F it up.  So I quickly went to work with a great team around me. I happened to find a funny guy to present it in Arabic  who is originally Korean  a perfect fit for the Axis of Evil. This is all true. Now  while preparing for the tour  I had to remind the guys to be culturally sensitive. I used the three Bs of stand up don'ts as I call them in the Middle East  blue content  keep it clean  beliefs  not religion  and the third B  bolitics. Stay away from bolitics in the Middle East. Oh course  you might think  what's left without bolitics  sex and religion  how can you make people laugh  I'd say  watch any successful well written  family friendly sitcom in the West for your answers. Now  were the Axis successful  In five countries  in just under a month  we had thousands of fanatical fans come and see them live. We had millions see them on TV and on TV news. In Jordan  we had His Majesty the King come and see them. In fact  they were so successful that you could buy a pirated copy of their DVD  even before it was released in the Middle East. Anywhere you go. So everywhere we went  we auditioned amateurs. We filmed that process and aired a documentary. I called it  Three Guys and Wonho.  It really is his name. And all this TV and Internet exposure has led to a great many recruits to our cause. In Dubai this year  we've just had the first all women's  homegrown stand up show. And notice two of them are wearing headscarves  and yes  even they can laugh. Dubai  to me  is like a hand that supports anyone who wants to make things happen.    years ago  no one had heard of it. Look at it now. With an inspirational leader  I think this year  the opening of the tallest tower in the world is like adding a finger to that hand  that points at all those who spread fallacious stories about us. Now  in three short years  we've come a long way with stand up comedy shows happening even in Saudi Arabia. These comics are now going to the New York festival. And the Lebanese  brilliant Lebanese  Nemr Abou Nassar  we featured in our first tour  has just been performing in L.A.'s legendary comedy clubs. So clearly  from the inside  we are doing our best to change our image  and it's exploding. So  as for the outsiders looking in  watch the CNN report on the second Amman Comedy Festival. The reporter did a great job  and I thank her  but somebody forgot to send the positive PR email to the person operating the automatic news ticker that appears at the bottom. For example  when Dean talks  the ticker says   U.S.  Suspect gave 'actionable intel.  Well  if you're used to listening to comedians  then I'm not surprised. Sadly  this leads me to another three Bs that represents how the media in the West talks about us as bombers  billionaires and belly dancers. Enough. We're not all angry fanatics who want to kill the infidel. We have a positive story to tell and image to sell. In fact  one thing's for sure  in my experience  we love to laugh like hell. Here are three questions that I like to use to test the truthiness of our representation in any media story. One  Is the Middle East being shown in a current time and correct context  Two  Do the Middle Eastern characters laugh or smile without showing the whites of their eyes  Three  Is the Middle Eastern character being played by one  Clearly  there are wrongs that need to be righted. We've started in our region. My challenge to the rest of the world is please  start using positive Middle Eastern images in your stories. For inspiration  go to one of our festivals  go online  drop us a line. Let's change the narrative together and let's start righting writing wrongs. I'd like to end  before going back to the Middle East  with a quote from one of the greatest Sheikhs to put quill to parchment. As my father likes to call him   Asheikh Azubare   as my mother would say   Shakespeare.   And now we go in content to liberty and not to banishment.  Thank you. I was one of the founding members of the Axis of Evil Comedy Tour. The other founding members included Ahmed Ahmed  who is an Egyptian American  who actually had the idea to go to the Middle East and try it out. Before we went out as a tour  he went out solo and did it first. Then there was Aron Kader  who was the Palestinian American. And then there was me  the Iranian American of the group. Now  being Iranian American presents its own set of problems  as you know. Those two countries aren't getting along these days. So it causes a lot of inner conflict  you know  like part of me likes me  part of me hates me. Part of me thinks I should have a nuclear program  the other part thinks I can't be trusted with one. These are dilemmas I have every day. But I was born in Iran  I'm now an American citizen  which means I have the American passport  which means I can travel. Because if you only have the Iranian passport  you're kind of limited to the countries you can go to with open arms  you know    Syria  Venezuela  North Korea. So anyone who's gotten their passport in America will tell you  when you get your passport  it still says what country you were born in. So I remember getting my American passport. I was like   Woohoo  I'm going to travel.  And I opened it up  it said   Born in Iran.  I'm like   Oh  come on  man.   I'm trying to go places.  But what's interesting is  I've never had trouble traveling in any other Western countries with my American passport  even though it says   Born in Iran.  No problems. Where I've had some problems is some of the Arab countries  because I guess some of the Arab countries aren't getting along with Iran either. And so I was in Kuwait recently  doing a comedy show with some other American comedians. They all went through  and then the border patrol saw my American passport.  Ah ha  American  great.  Then he opened it up.  Born in Iran  Wait.  And he started asking me questions. He said   What is your father's name   I said   Well  he's passed away  but his name was Khosro.  He goes   What is your grandfather's name   I said   He passed away a long time ago. His name was Jabbar.  He says   You wait. I'll be back   and he walked away. And I started freaking out  because I don't know what kind of crap my grandfather was into. Thought the guy was going to come back and be like   We've been looking for you for     years.   Your grandfather has a parking violation. It's way overdue. You owe us two billion dollars.  But as you can see  when I talk  I speak with an American accent  which you would think as an Iranian American actor  I should be able to play any part  good  bad  what have you. But a lot of times in Hollywood  when casting directors find out you're of Middle Eastern descent  they go   Oh  you're Iranian. Great. Can you say 'I will kill you in the name of Allah '   I could say that  but what if I were to say  'Hello. I'm your doctor '  They go   Great. And then you hijack the hospital.  Like I think you're missing the point here. Don't get me wrong  I don't mind playing bad guys. I want to play a bad guy. I want to rob a bank. I want to rob a bank in a film. I want to rob a bank in a film  but do it with a gun  with a gun  not with a bomb strapped around me  right. Because I imagine the director   Maz  I think your character would rob the bank with a bomb around him.   Why would I do that  If I want the money  why would I kill myself   Right.  Gimme all your money  or I'll blow myself up.   Well  then blow yourself up. Just do it outside  please.  But the fact is  there's good people everywhere. That's what I try and show in my stand up. There's good people everywhere. All it takes in one person to mess it up. Like a couple months ago in Times Square in New York  there was this Pakistani Muslim guy who tried to blow up a car bomb. Now  I happened to be in Times Square that night doing a comedy show. And a few months before that  there was a white American guy in Austin  Texas who flew his airplane into the IRS building  and I happened to be in Austin that day doing a stand up comedy show. Now I'll tell you  as a Middle Eastern male  when you show up around a lot of these activities  you start feeling guilty at one point. I was watching the news. I'm like   Am I involved in this crap    I didn't get the memo. What's going on   But what was interesting was  the Pakistani Muslim guy    see he gives a bad name to Muslims and Middle Easterners and Pakistanis from all over the world. And one thing that happened there was also the Pakistani Taliban took credit for that failed car bombing. My question is  why would you take credit for a failed car bombing   We just wanted to say we tried.   And furthermore  it is the thought that counts.   And in conclusion  win some  lose some.  But what happened was  when the white guy flew his plane into the building  I know all my Middle Eastern and Muslim friends in the States were watching TV  going   Please  don't be Middle Eastern. Don't be Hassan. Don't be Hussein.  And the name came out Jack. I'm like   Woooo  That's not one of us.  But I kept watching the news in case they came back  they were like   Before he did it  he converted to Islam.   Damn it  Why Jack  Why   But the fact is  I've been lucky to get a chance to perform all over the world  and I did a lot of shows in the Middle East. I just did a seven country solo tour. I was in Oman  and I was in Saudi Arabia. I was in Dubai. And it's great  there's good people everywhere. And you learn great things about these places. I encourage people always to go visit these places. For example  Dubai    cool place. They're obsessed with having the biggest  tallest  longest  as we all know. They have a mall there  the Dubai Mall. It is so big  they have taxis in the mall. I was walking. I heard  Beep  beep.  I'm like   What are you doing here   He goes   I'm going to the Zara store. It's three miles away. Out of my way. Out of my way. Out of my way.  And what's crazy    there's a recession going on  even in Dubai  but you wouldn't know by the prices. Like in the Dubai Mall  they sell frozen yogurt by the gram. It's like a drug deal. I was walking by. The guy goes   Psst. Habibi  my friend.   You want some frozen yogurt  Come here. Come here. Come here. I have one gram  five gram     gram. How many gram do you want   I bought five grams.    dollars.    dollars  I said   What's in this   He's like   Good stuff  man. Columbian. Top of the line. Top of the line.  The other thing you learn sometimes when you travel to these countries in the Middle East  sometimes in Latin American countries  South American countries    a lot of times when they build stuff  there's no rules and regulations. For example  I took my two year old son to the playground at the Dubai Mall. And I've taken my two year old son to playgrounds all over the United States. And when you put your two year old on a slide in the United States  they put something on the slide to slow the kid down as he comes down the slide. Not in the Middle East. I put my two year old on the slide  he went frrmrmm  He took off. I went down. I go   Where's my son    On the third floor  sir. On the third floor.   You take a taxi. You go to Zara. Make a left.   Try the yogurt. It's very good. Little expensive.  But one of the things I try to do with my stand up is to break stereotypes. And I've been guilty of stereotyping as well. I was in Dubai. And there's a lot of Indians who work in Dubai. And they don't get paid that well. And I got it in my head that all the Indians there must be workers. And I forgot there's obviously successful Indians in Dubai as well. I was doing a show  and they said   We're going to send a driver to pick you up.  So I went down to the lobby  and I saw this Indian guy. I go   He's got to be my driver.  Because he was standing there in like a cheap suit  thin mustache  staring at me. So I went over   Excuse me  sir  are you my driver   He goes   No  sir. I own the hotel.  I go   I'm sorry. Then why were you staring at me   He goes   I thought you were my driver.  I'll leave you guys with this  I try  with my stand up  to break stereotypes  present Middle Easterners in a positive light    Muslims in a positive light    and I hope that in the coming years  more film and television programs come out of Hollywood presenting us in a positive light. Who knows  maybe one day we'll even have our own James Bond  right.  My name is Bond  Jamal Bond.  Til then  I'll keep telling jokes. I hope you keep laughing. Have a good day. Thank you. My name's Seth Priebatsch. I'm the chief ninja of SCVNGR. I am a proud Princeton dropout. Also proud to have relocated here to Boston  where I actually grew up. Yeah  Boston. Easy wins. I should just go and name the counties that we've got around here. So  I'm also fairly determined to try and build a game layer on top of the world. And this is sort of a new concept  and it's really important. Because while the last decade was the decade of social and the decade of where the framework in which we connect with other people was built  this next decade will be the decade where the game framework is built  where the motivations that we use to actually influence behavior  and the framework in which that is constructed  is decided upon  and that's really important. And so I say that I want to build a game layer on top of the world  but that's not quite true because it's already under construction  it's already happening. And it looks like this right now. It looks like the Web did back in       right  It's not very good. It's cluttered. It's filled with lots of different things that  in short  aren't that fun. There are credit card schemes and airline mile programs and coupon cards and all these loyalty schemes that actually do use game dynamics and actually are building the game layer  they just suck. They're not very well designed  right  So  that's unfortunate. But luckily  as my favorite action hero  Bob the Builder  says   We can do better. We can build this better.  And the tools  the resources that we use to build a game layer are game dynamics themselves. And so  sort of  the crux of this presentation is going to go through four really important game dynamics  really interesting things  that  if you use consciously  you can use to influence behavior  both for good  for bad  for in between. Hopefully for good. But this is sort of the important stages in which that framework will get built  and so we want to all be thinking about it consciously now. Just before we jump into that  there's sort of a question of  why is this important  I'm sort of making this claim that there is a game layer on top of the world  and that it's very important that we build it properly. The reason that it's so important is that  the last decade  what we've seen has been building the social layer  has been this framework for connections  and construction on that layer is over  it's finished. There's still a lot to explore. There's still a lot of people who are trying to figure out social and how do we leverage this and how do we use this  but the framework itself is done  and it's called Facebook. And that's okay  right  A lot of people are very happy with Facebook. I like it quite a lot. They've created this thing called the Open Graph  and they own all of our connections. They own half a billion people. And so when you want to build on the social layer  the framework has been decided  it is the Open Graph API. And if you're happy with that  fantastic. If you're not  too bad. There's nothing you can do. But this next decade    and that's a real thing. I mean  we want to build frameworks in a way that makes it acceptable and makes it  you know  productive down the road. So  the social layer is all about these connections. The game layer is all about influence. It's not about adding a social fabric to the Web and connecting you to other people everywhere you are and everywhere you go. It's actually about using dynamics  using forces  to influence the behavior of where you are  what you do there  how you do it. That's really  really powerful  and it's going to be more important than the social layer. It's going to affect our lives more deeply and perhaps more invisibly. And so it's incredibly critical that at this moment  while it's just getting constructed  while the frameworks like Facebook  like the Open Graph  are being created for the game layer equivalent  that we think about it very consciously  and that we do it in a way that is open  that is available  and that can be leveraged for good. And so that's what I want to talk about for game dynamics  because construction has just begun  and the more consciously we can think about this  the better we'll be able to use it for anything that we want. So like I said  the way that you go through and build on the game layer is not with glass and steel and cement. And the resources that we use are not this two dimensional swath of land that we have. The resources are mindshare and the tools  the raw materials are these game dynamics. So with that  you know  a couple game dynamics to talk about. Four. Back at SCVNGR  we like to joke that with seven game dynamics  you can get anyone to do anything. And so today  I'm going to show you four  because I hope to have a competitive advantage at the end of this  still. So the first one  it's a very simple game dynamic. It's called the appointment dynamic. And this is a dynamic in which to succeed  players have to do something at a predefined time  generally at a predefined place. And these dynamics are a little scary sometimes  because you think  you know  other people can be using forces that will manipulate how I interact  what I do  where I do it  when I do it. This sort of loss of free will that occurs in games can be frightening  so with each dynamic  I'm going to give three examples  one that shows how this is already being used in the real world  so you can sort of rationalize it a little bit  one that shows it in what we consider a conventional game    I think everything is a game  but this is sort of more of a what you would think is a game played on a board or on a computer screen  and then one how this can be used for good  so we can see that these forces can really be very powerful. So the first one    the most famous appointment dynamic in the world    is something called happy hour. So I just recently dropped out of Princeton and actually ended up for the first time in a bar  and I saw these happy hour things all over the place  right. And this is simply an appointment dynamic. Come here at a certain time  get your drinks half off. To win  all you have to do is show up at the right place at the right time. This game dynamic is so powerful that it doesn't just influence our behavior  it's influenced our entire culture. That's a really scary thought  that one game dynamic can change things so powerfully. It also exists in more conventional game forms. I'm sure you've all heard of Farmville by now. If you haven't  I recommend playing it. You won't do anything else with the rest of your day. Farmville has more active users than Twitter. It's incredibly powerful  and it has this dynamic where you have to return at a certain time to water your crops    fake crops    or they wilt. And this is so powerful that  when they tweak their stats  when they say your crops wilt after eight hours  or after six hours  or after    hours  it changes the lifecycle of    million some people during the day. They will return like clockwork at different times. So if they wanted the world to end  if they wanted productivity to stop  they could make this a    minute cycle  and no one could do anything else  right  That's a little scary. But this could also be used for good. This is a local company called Vitality  and they've created a product to help people take their medicine on time. That's an appointment. It's something that people don't do very well. And they have these GlowCaps  which  you know  flash and email you and do all sorts of cool things to remind you to take your medicine. This is one that isn't a game yet  but really should be. You should get points for doing this on time. You should lose points for not doing this on time. They should consciously recognize that they've built an appointment dynamic and leverage the games. And then you can really achieve good in some interesting ways. We're going to jump onto the next one  maybe. Yes. Influence and status. So this is one of the most famous game dynamics. It's used all over the place. It's used in your wallets  right now. We all want that credit card on the far left because it's black. And you see someone at CVS or    not CVS    at Christian Dior or something  and then ... I don't know. I don't have a black card  I've got a debit card. So they whip it out. And you see men  they have that black card. I want that because that means that they're cooler than I am  and I need that. And this is used in games as well.  Modern Warfare   one of the most successful selling games of all time. I'm only a level four  but I desperately want to be a level     because they've got that cool red badge thing  and that means that I am somehow better than everyone else. And that's very powerful to me. Status is really good motivator. It's also used in more conventional settings and can be used more consciously in conventional settings. School    and remember  I made it through one year  so I think I'm qualified to talk on school    is a game  it's just not a terribly well designed game  right. There are levels. There are C. There are B. There is A. There are statuses. I mean  what is valedictorian  but a status  If we called valedictorian a  white knight paladin level      I think people would probably work a lot harder. So school is a game  and there have been lots of experimentations on how we do this properly. But let's use it consciously. Like why have games that you can lose  Why go from an A to an F or a B to a C  That sucks. Why not level up  And at Princeton  they've actually experimented with this  where they have quizzes where you gain experience points  and you level up from B to an A. And it's very powerful. It can be used in interesting ways. The third one I want to talk about quickly is the progression dynamic  where you have to sort of make progress  you have to move through different steps in a very granular fashion. This is used all over the place  including LinkedIn  where I am an un whole individual. I am only    percent complete on LinkedIn  and that bothers me. And this is so deep seated in our psyche that when we're presented with a progress bar and presented with easy  granular steps to take to try and complete that progress bar  we will do it. We will find a way to move that blue line all the way to the right edge of the screen. This is used in conventional games as well. I mean  you see this is a paladin level     and that's a paladin level     and if you were going to fight  you know  orcs on the fields of Mordor against the Raz al Ghul  you'd probably want to be the bigger one  right. I would. And so people work very hard to level up.  World of Warcraft  is one of the most successful games of all time. The average player spends something like six  six and a half hours a day on it. Their most dedicated players  it's like a full time job. It's insane. And they have these systems where you can level up. And that's a very powerful thing. Progression is powerful. It can also be used in very compelling ways for good. One of the things that we work on at SCVNGR is how do you use games to drive traffic and drive business to local businesses  to sort of something that is very key to the economy. And here we have a game that people play. They go places  they do challenges  they earn points. And we've introduced a progression dynamic into it  where  by going to the same place over and over  by doing challenges  by engaging with the business  you move a green bar from the left edge of the screen to the right edge of the screen  and you eventually unlock rewards. And this is powerful enough that we can see that it hooks people into these dynamics  pulls them back to the same local businesses  creates huge loyalty  creates engagement  and is able to drive meaningful revenue and fun and engagement to businesses. These progression dynamics are powerful and can be used in the real world. The final one I want to talk about    and it's a great one to end on    is this concept of communal discovery  a dynamic in which everyone has to work together to achieve something. And communal discovery is powerful because it leverages the network that is society to solve problems. This is used in some sort of famous consumer web stories  like Digg  which I'm sure you've all heard of. Digg is a communal dynamic to try to find and source the best news  the most interesting stories. And they made this into a game  initially. They had a leader board  where  if you recommended the best stories  you would get points. And that really motivated people to find the best stories. But it became so powerful that there was actually a cabal  a group of people  the top seven on the leader board  who would work together to make sure they maintained that position. And they would recommend other people's stories  and the game became more powerful than the goal. And they actually had to end up shutting down the leader board because while it was effective  it was so powerful that it stopped sourcing the best stories and started having people work to maintain their leadership. So we have to use this one carefully. It's also used in things like McDonald's Monopoly  where the game is not the Monopoly game you're playing  but the sort of cottage industries that form to try and find Boardwalk  right. And now they're just looking for a little sticker that says  Boardwalk.  But it can also be used to find real things. This is the DARPA balloon challenge  where they hid a couple balloons all across the United States and said   Use networks. Try and find these balloons fastest  and the winner will get        .  And the winner was actually a group out of MIT  where they created sort of a pyramid scheme  a network  where the first person to recommend the location of a balloon got        and anyone else to push that recommendation up also got a cut of it. And in    hours  they were able to find all these balloons  all across the country  right. Really powerful dynamic. And so  I've got about    seconds left  so if I'm going to leave you with anything  last decade was the decade of social. This next decade is the decade of games. We use game dynamics to build on it. We build with mindshare. We can influence behavior. It is very powerful. It is very exciting. Let's all build it together  let's do it well and have fun playing. It feels like we're all suffering from information overload or data glut. And the good news is there might be an easy solution to that  and that's using our eyes more. So  visualizing information  so that we can see the patterns and connections that matter and then designing that information so it makes more sense  or it tells a story  or allows us to focus only on the information that's important. Failing that  visualized information can just look really cool. So  let's see. This is the  Billion Dollar o Gram  and this image arose out of frustration I had with the reporting of billion dollar amounts in the press. That is  they're meaningless without context      billion for this pipeline     billion for this war. It doesn't make any sense  so the only way to understand it is visually and relatively. So I scraped a load of reported figures from various news outlets and then scaled the boxes according to those amounts. And the colors here represent the motivation behind the money. So purple is  fighting   and red is  giving money away   and green is  profiteering.  And what you can see straight away is you start to have a different relationship to the numbers. You can literally see them. But more importantly  you start to see patterns and connections between numbers that would otherwise be scattered across multiple news reports. Let me point out some that I really like. This is OPEC's revenue  this green box here        billion a year. And this little pixel in the corner    three billion    that's their climate change fund. Americans  incredibly generous people    over     billion a year  donated to charity every year  compared with the amount of foreign aid given by the top    industrialized nations at     billion. Then of course  the Iraq War  predicted to cost just    billion back in     . And it mushroomed slightly. Afghanistan and Iraq mushroomed now to       billion. So now it's great because now we have this texture  and we can add numbers to it as well. So we could say  well  a new figure comes out ... let's see African debt. How much of this diagram do you think might be taken up by the debt that Africa owes to the West  Let's take a look. So there it is      billion is what Africa owes. And the recent financial crisis  how much of this diagram might that figure take up  What has that cost the world  Let's take a look at that. Dooosh    Which I think is the appropriate sound effect for that much money         billion. So  by visualizing this information  we turned it into a landscape that you can explore with your eyes  a kind of map really  a sort of information map. And when you're lost in information  an information map is kind of useful. So I want to show you another landscape now. We need to imagine what a landscape of the world's fears might look like. Let's take a look. This is Mountains Out of Molehills  a timeline of global media panic. So  I'll label this for you in a second. But the height here  I want to point out  is the intensity of certain fears as reported in the media. Let me point them out. So this  swine flu    pink. Bird flu. SARS    brownish here. Remember that one  The millennium bug  terrible disaster. These little green peaks are asteroid collisions. And in summer  here  killer wasps. So these are what our fears look like over time in our media. But what I love    and I'm a journalist    and what I love is finding hidden patterns  I love being a data detective. And there's a very interesting and odd pattern hidden in this data that you can only see when you visualize it. Let me highlight it for you. See this line  this is a landscape for violent video games. As you can see  there's a kind of odd  regular pattern in the data  twin peaks every year. If we look closer  we see those peaks occur at the same month every year. Why  Well  November  Christmas video games come out  and there may well be an upsurge in the concern about their content. But April isn't a particularly massive month for video games. Why April  Well  in April      was the Columbine shooting  and since then  that fear has been remembered by the media and echoes through the group mind gradually through the year. You have retrospectives  anniversaries  court cases  even copy cat shootings  all pushing that fear into the agenda. And there's another pattern here as well. Can you spot it  See that gap there  There's a gap  and it affects all the other stories. Why is there a gap there  You see where it starts  September       when we had something very real to be scared about. So  I've been working as a data journalist for about a year  and I keep hearing a phrase all the time  which is this   Data is the new oil.  Data is the kind of ubiquitous resource that we can shape to provide new innovations and new insights  and it's all around us  and it can be mined very easily. It's not a particularly great metaphor in these times  especially if you live around the Gulf of Mexico  but I would  perhaps  adapt this metaphor slightly  and I would say that data is the new soil. Because for me  it feels like a fertile  creative medium. Over the years  online  we've laid down a huge amount of information and data  and we irrigate it with networks and connectivity  and it's been worked and tilled by unpaid workers and governments. And  all right  I'm kind of milking the metaphor a little bit. But it's a really fertile medium  and it feels like visualizations  infographics  data visualizations  they feel like flowers blooming from this medium. But if you look at it directly  it's just a lot of numbers and disconnected facts. But if you start working with it and playing with it in a certain way  interesting things can appear and different patterns can be revealed. Let me show you this. Can you guess what this data set is  What rises twice a year  once in Easter and then two weeks before Christmas  has a mini peak every Monday  and then flattens out over the summer  I'll take answers. You might want to get some chocolate in. Any other guesses  Yeah  retail therapy might help. DM  Sick leave. Yeah  you'll definitely want to take some time off. Shall we see  So  the information guru Lee Byron and myself  we scraped        status Facebook updates for the phrase  break up  and  broken up  and this is the pattern we found    people clearing out for Spring Break  coming out of very bad weekends on a Monday  being single over the summer  and then the lowest day of the year  of course  Christmas Day. Who would do that  So there's a titanic amount of data out there now  unprecedented. But if you ask the right kind of question  or you work it in the right kind of way  interesting things can emerge. So information is beautiful. Data is beautiful. I wonder if I could make my life beautiful. And here's my visual C.V. I'm not quite sure I've succeeded. Pretty blocky  the colors aren't that great. But I wanted to convey something to you. I started as a programmer  and then I worked as a writer for many years  about    years  in print  online and then in advertising  and only recently have I started designing. And I've never been to design school. I've never studied art or anything. I just kind of learned through doing. And when I started designing  I discovered an odd thing about myself. I already knew how to design  but it wasn't like I was amazingly brilliant at it  but more like I was sensitive to the ideas of grids and space and alignment and typography. It's almost like being exposed to all this media over the years had instilled a kind of dormant design literacy in me. And I don't feel like I'm unique. I feel that everyday  all of us now are being blasted by information design. It's being poured into our eyes through the Web  and we're all visualizers now  we're all demanding a visual aspect to our information. There's something almost quite magical about visual information. It's effortless  it literally pours in. And if you're navigating a dense information jungle  coming across a beautiful graphic or a lovely data visualization  it's a relief  it's like coming across a clearing in the jungle. I was curious about this  so it led me to the work of a Danish physicist called Tor Norretranders  and he converted the bandwidth of the senses into computer terms. So here we go. This is your senses  pouring into your senses every second. Your sense of sight is the fastest. It has the same bandwidth as a computer network. Then you have touch  which is about the speed of a USB key. And then you have hearing and smell  which has the throughput of a hard disk. And then you have poor old taste  which is like barely the throughput of a pocket calculator. And that little square in the corner  a naught .  percent  that's the amount we're actually aware of. So a lot of your vision    the bulk of it is visual  and it's pouring in. It's unconscious. The eye is exquisitely sensitive to patterns in variations in color  shape and pattern. It loves them  and it calls them beautiful. It's the language of the eye. If you combine the language of the eye with the language of the mind  which is about words and numbers and concepts  you start speaking two languages simultaneously  each enhancing the other. So  you have the eye  and then you drop in the concepts. And that whole thing    it's two languages both working at the same time. So we can use this new kind of language  if you like  to alter our perspective or change our views. Let me ask you a simple question with a really simple answer  Who has the biggest military budget  It's got to be America  right  Massive.     billion in              rather. So massive  in fact  that it can contain all the other military budgets in the world inside itself. Gobble  gobble  gobble  gobble  gobble. Now  you can see Africa's total debt there and the U.K. budget deficit for reference. So that might well chime with your view that America is a sort of warmongering military machine  out to overpower the world with its huge industrial military complex. But is it true that America has the biggest military budget  Because America is an incredibly rich country. In fact  it's so massively rich that it can contain the four other top industrialized nations' economies inside itself  it's so vastly rich. So its military budget is bound to be enormous. So  to be fair and to alter our perspective  we have to bring in another data set  and that data set is GDP  or the country's earnings. Who has the biggest budget as a proportion of GDP  Let's have a look. That changes the picture considerably. Other countries pop into view that you  perhaps  weren't considering  and American drops into eighth. Now you can also do this with soldiers. Who has the most soldiers  It's got to be China. Of course   .  million. Again  chiming with your view that China has a militarized regime ready to  you know  mobilize its enormous forces. But of course  China has an enormous population. So if we do the same  we see a radically different picture. China drops to    th. It actually has a tiny army when you take other data into consideration. So  absolute figures  like the military budget  in a connected world  don't give you the whole picture. They're not as true as they could be. We need relative figures that are connected to other data so that we can see a fuller picture  and then that can lead to us changing our perspective. As Hans Rosling  the master  my master  said   Let the dataset change your mindset.  And if it can do that  maybe it can also change your behavior. Take a look at this one. I'm a bit of a health nut. I love taking supplements and being fit  but I can never understand what's going on in terms of evidence. There's always conflicting evidence. Should I take vitamin C  Should I be taking wheatgrass  This is a visualization of all the evidence for nutritional supplements. This kind of diagram is called a balloon race. So the higher up the image  the more evidence there is for each supplement. And the bubbles correspond to popularity as regards to Google hits. So you can immediately apprehend the relationship between efficacy and popularity  but you can also  if you grade the evidence  do a  worth it  line. So supplements above this line are worth investigating  but only for the conditions listed below  and then the supplements below the line are perhaps not worth investigating. Now this image constitutes a huge amount of work. We scraped like       studies from PubMed  the biomedical database  and we compiled them and graded them all. And it was incredibly frustrating for me because I had a book of     visualizations to do for my book  and I spent a month doing this  and I only filled two pages. But what it points to is that visualizing information like this is a form of knowledge compression. It's a way of squeezing an enormous amount of information and understanding into a small space. And once you've curated that data  and once you've cleaned that data  and once it's there  you can do cool stuff like this. So I converted this into an interactive app  so I can now generate this application online    this is the visualization online    and I can say   Yeah  brilliant.  So it spawns itself. And then I can say   Well  just show me the stuff that affects heart health.  So let's filter that out. So heart is filtered out  so I can see if I'm curious about that. I think   No  no. I don't want to take any synthetics  I just want to see plants and    just show me herbs and plants. I've got all the natural ingredients.  Now this app is spawning itself from the data. The data is all stored in a Google Doc  and it's literally generating itself from that data. So the data is now alive  this is a living image  and I can update it in a second. New evidence comes out. I just change a row on a spreadsheet. Doosh  Again  the image recreates itself. So it's cool. It's kind of living. But it can go beyond data  and it can go beyond numbers. I like to apply information visualization to ideas and concepts. This is a visualization of the political spectrum  an attempt for me to try and understand how it works and how the ideas percolate down from government into society and culture  into families  into individuals  into their beliefs and back around again in a cycle. What I love about this image is it's made up of concepts  it explores our worldviews and it helps us    it helps me anyway    to see what others think  to see where they're coming from. And it feels just incredibly cool to do that. What was most exciting for me designing this was that  when I was designing this image  I desperately wanted this side  the left side  to be better than the right side    being a journalist  a Left leaning person    but I couldn't  because I would have created a lopsided  biased diagram. So  in order to really create a full image  I had to honor the perspectives on the right hand side and at the same time  uncomfortably recognize how many of those qualities were actually in me  which was very  very annoying and uncomfortable. But not too uncomfortable  because there's something unthreatening about seeing a political perspective  versus being told or forced to listen to one. You're capable of holding conflicting viewpoints joyously when you can see them. It's even fun to engage with them because it's visual. So that's what's exciting to me  seeing how data can change my perspective and change my mind midstream    beautiful  lovely data. So  just to wrap up  I wanted to say that it feels to me that design is about solving problems and providing elegant solutions  and information design is about solving information problems. It feels like we have a lot of information problems in our society at the moment  from the overload and the saturation to the breakdown of trust and reliability and runaway skepticism and lack of transparency  or even just interestingness. I mean  I find information just too interesting. It has a magnetic quality that draws me in. So  visualizing information can give us a very quick solution to those kinds of problems. Even when the information is terrible  the visual can be quite beautiful. Often we can get clarity or the answer to a simple question very quickly  like this one  the recent Icelandic volcano. Which was emitting the most CO   Was it the planes or the volcano  the grounded planes or the volcano  So we can have a look. We look at the data and we see  Yep  the volcano emitted         tons  the grounded planes would have emitted         if they were in the sky. So essentially  we had our first carbon neutral volcano. And that is beautiful. Thank you. Come with me to the bottom of the world  Antarctica  the highest  driest  windiest  and yes  coldest region on Earth    more arid than the Sahara and  in parts  colder than Mars. The ice of Antarctica glows with a light so dazzling  it blinds the unprotected eye. Early explorers rubbed cocaine in their eyes to kill the pain of it. The weight of the ice is such that the entire continent sags below sea level  beneath its weight. Yet  the ice of Antarctica is a calendar of climate change. It records the annual rise and fall of greenhouse gases and temperatures going back before the onset of the last ice ages. Nowhere on Earth offers us such a perfect record. And here  scientists are drilling into the past of our planet to find clues to the future of climate change. This past January  I traveled to a place called WAIS Divide  about     miles from the South Pole. It is the best place on the planet  many say  to study the history of climate change. There  about    scientists from the University of Wisconsin  the Desert Research Institute in Nevada and others have been working to answer a central question about global warming. What is the exact relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and planetary temperatures  It's urgent work. We know that temperatures are rising. This past May was the warmest worldwide on record. And we know that levels of greenhouse gases are rising too. What we don't know is the exact  precise  immediate impact of these changes on natural climate patterns    winds  ocean currents  precipitation rates  cloud formation  things that bear on the health and well being of billions of people. Their entire camp  every item of gear  was ferried     miles from McMurdo Station  the main U.S. supply base on the coast of Antarctica. WAIS Divide itself though  is a circle of tents in the snow. In blizzard winds  the crew sling ropes between the tents so that people can feel their way safely to the nearest ice house and to the nearest outhouse. It snows so heavily there  the installation was almost immediately buried. Indeed  the researchers picked this site because ice and snow accumulates here    times faster than anywhere else in Antarctica. They have to dig themselves out every day. It makes for an exotic and chilly commute. But under the surface is a hive of industrial activity centered around an eight million dollar drill assembly. Periodically  this drill  like a biopsy needle  plunges thousands of feet deep into the ice to extract a marrow of gases and isotopes for analysis. Ten times a day  they extract the    foot long cylinder of compressed ice crystals that contain the unsullied air and trace chemicals laid down by snow  season after season for thousands of years. It's really a time machine. At the peak of activity earlier this year  the researchers lowered the drill an extra hundred feet deeper into the ice every day and another     years deeper into the past. Periodically  they remove a cylinder of ice  like gamekeepers popping a spent shotgun shell from the barrel of a drill. They inspect it  they check it for cracks  for drill damage  for spalls  for chips. More importantly  they prepare it for inspection and analysis by    independent laboratories in the United States and Europe  who will examine it for    different trace chemicals related to climate  some in parts per quadrillion. Yes  I said that with a Q  quadrillion. They cut the cylinders up into three foot sections for easier handling and shipment back to these labs  some       miles from the drill site. Each cylinder is a parfait of time. This ice formed as snow        years ago  when our ancestors were daubing themselves with paint and considering the radical new technology of the alphabet. Bathed in polarized light and cut in cross section  this ancient ice reveals itself as a mosaic of colors  each one showing how conditions at depth in the ice have affected this material at depths where pressures can reach a ton per square inch. Every year  it begins with a snowflake  and by digging into fresh snow  we can see how this process is ongoing today. This wall of undisturbed snow  back lit by sunlight  shows the striations of winter and summer snow  layer upon layer. Each storm scours the atmosphere  washing out dust  soot  trace chemicals  and depositing them on the snow pack year after year  millennia after millennia  creating a kind of periodic table of elements that at this point is more than        feet thick. From this  we can detect an extraordinary number of things. We can see the calcium from the world's deserts  soot from distant wildfires  methane as an indicator of the strength of a Pacific monsoon  all wafted on winds from warmer latitudes to this remote and very cold place. Most importantly  these cylinders and this snow trap air. Each cylinder is about    percent ancient air  a pristine time capsule of greenhouse gases    carbon dioxide  methane  nitrous oxide    all unchanged from the day that snow formed and first fell. And this is the object of their scrutiny. But don't we already know what we need to know about greenhouse gases  Why do we need to study this anymore  Don't we already know how they affect temperatures  Don't we already know the consequences of a changing climate on our settled civilization  The truth is  we only know the outlines  and what we don't completely understand  we can't properly fix. Indeed  we run the risk of making things worse. Consider  the single most successful international environmental effort of the   th century  the Montreal Protocol  in which the nations of Earth banded together to protect the planet from the harmful effects of ozone destroying chemicals used at that time in air conditioners  refrigerators and other cooling devices. We banned those chemicals  and we replaced them  unknowingly  with other substances that  molecule per molecule  are a hundred times more potent as heat trapping  greenhouse gases than carbon dioxide. This process requires extraordinary precautions. The scientists must insure that the ice is not contaminated. Moreover  in this       mile journey  they have to insure this ice doesn't melt. Imagine juggling a snowball across the tropics. They have to  in fact  make sure this ice never gets warmer than about    degrees below zero  otherwise  the key gases inside it will dissipate. So  in the coldest place on Earth  they work inside a refrigerator. As they handle the ice  in fact  they keep an extra pair of gloves warming in an oven  so that  when their work gloves freeze and their fingers stiffen  they can don a fresh pair. They work against the clock and against the thermometer. So far  they've packed up about       feet of ice cores for shipment back to the United States. This past season  they manhandled them across the ice to waiting aircraft. The    th Air National Guard flew the most recent shipment of ice back to the coast of Antarctica  where it was boarded onto a freighter  shipped across the tropics to California  unloaded  put on a truck  driven across the desert to the National Ice Core Laboratory in Denver  Colorado  where  as we speak  scientists are now slicing this material up for samples  for analysis  to be distributed to the laboratories around the country and in Europe. Antarctica was this planet's last empty quarter    the blind spot in our expanding vision of the world. Early explorers sailed off the edge of the map  and they found a place where the normal rules of time and temperature seem suspended. Here  the ice seems a living presence. The wind that rubs against it gives it voice. It is a voice of experience. It is a voice we should heed. Thank you. Cartoons are basically short stories. I tried to find one that didn't have a whole lot of words. Not all of them have happy endings. So how did I get started cartooning  I doodled a lot as a kid  and if you spend enough time doodling  sooner or later  something happens  all your career options run out. So you have to make a living cartooning. Actually  I fell in love with the ocean when I was a little boy  when I was about eight or nine. And I was particularly fascinated with sharks. This is some of my early work. Eventually  my mom took the red crayon away  so it was  unclear . But I'd like to relay to you a childhood experience of mine that really made me see the ocean differently  and it's become the foundation of my work because  I feel like  if in a day  I can see the ocean differently  then I can evoke that same kind of change in others  especially kids. Before that day  this is how I saw the ocean. It's just a big blue surface. And this is how we've seen the ocean since the beginning of time. It's a mystery. There's been a lot of folklore developed around the ocean  mostly negative. And that prompted people to make maps like this  with all kinds of wonderful detail on the land  but when you get to the waters edge  the ocean looks like one giant puddle of blue paint. And this is the way I saw the ocean at school    as if to say   All geography and science lessons stop at water's edge. This part's not going to be on the test.  But that day I flew low over the islands    it was a family trip to the Caribbean  and I flew in a small plane low over the islands. This is what I saw. I saw hills and valleys. I saw forests and meadows. I saw grottoes and secret gardens and places I'd love to hide as a kid  if I could only breathe underwater. And best of all  I saw the animals. I saw a manta ray that looked as big as the plane I was flying in. And I flew over a lagoon with a shark in it  and that was the day that my comic strip about a shark was born. So from that day on  I was an ordinary kid walking around on dry land  but my head was down there  underwater. Up until that day  these were the animals that were most common in my life. These were the ones I'd like to draw    all variations of four legs and fur. But when you got to the ocean  my imagination was no competition for nature. Every time I'd come up with a crazy cartoon character on the drawing board  I'd find a critter in the ocean that was even crazier. And the differences in scale between this tiny sea dragon and this enormous humpback whale was like something out of a science fiction movie. Whenever I talk to kids  I always like to tell them  the biggest animal that ever lived is still alive. It's not a dinosaur  it's a whale  animals as big as office buildings still swimming around out there in our ocean. Speaking of dinosaurs  sharks are basically the same fish they were     million years ago. So if you ever fantasize about going back in time and seeing what a dinosaur looked like  that's what a dinosaur looks like. So you have living dinosaurs and space aliens  animals that evolved in zero gravity in harsh conditions. It's just incredible  no Hollywood designer could come up with something more interesting than that. Or this fangtooth. The particles in the water make it look like it's floating in outer space. Could you image if we looked through the Hubble Telescope and we saw that  It would start a whole new space race. But instead  we stick a camera in the deep ocean  and we see a fish  and it doesn't capture our imagination as a society. We say to ourselves   Maybe we can make fish sticks with it or something.  So  what I'd like to do now is try a little drawing. So  I'm going to try to draw this fangtooth here. I love to draw the deep sea fish  because they are so ugly  but beautiful in their own way. Maybe we can give him a little bioluminescence here    give him a headlight  maybe a brake light  turn signals. But it's easy to see why these animals make such great cartoon characters  their shapes and sizes. So some of them actually seem to have powers like superheroes in a comic book. For instance  take these sea turtles. They kind of have a sixth sense like Superman's x ray vision. They can sense the magnetic fields of the earth. And they can use that sense to navigate hundreds of miles of open ocean. I kind of give my turtle hands just to make them an easier cartoon character to work with. Or take this sea cucumber. It's not an animal we draw cartoons of or draw at all. He's like an underwater Spiderman. He shoots out these sticky webs to entangle his enemy. Of course  sea cucumbers shoot them out their rears  which  in my opinion  makes them much more interesting a superhero. He can't spin a web anytime  he's got to pull his pants down first. Or the blowfish. The blowfish is like the Incredible Hulk. It can change its body into a big  intimidating fish in a matter of seconds. I'm going to draw this blowfish uninflated. And then I'm going to attempt onscreen animation here. Let's see. Try and inflate it.  You talkin' to me   See  he can inflate himself when he wants to be intimidating. Or take this swordfish. Could you imagine being born with a tool for a nose  Do you think he wakes up in the morning  looks in the mirror and says   Somebody's getting stabbed today.  Or this lionfish for instance. Imagine trying to make friends covered with razor sharp poisonous barbs. It's not something you want to put on your Facebook page  right  My characters are    my lead character's a shark named Sherman. He's a great white shark. And I kind of broke the mold with Sherman. I didn't want to go with this ruthless predator image. He's kind of just out there making a living. He's sort of a Homer Simpson with fins. And then his sidekick is a sea turtle  as I mentioned before  named Filmore. He uses his wonderful skills at navigation to wander the oceans  looking for a mate. And he does manage to find them  but great navigation skills  lousy pick up lines. He never seems to settle on any particular girl. I have a hermit crab named Hawthorne  who doesn't get a lot of respect as a hermit crab  so he kind of wishes he were a great white shark. And then I'll introduce you to one more character  this guy  Ernest  who is basically a juvenile delinquent in a fish body. So with characters  you can make stories. Sometimes making a story is as easy as putting two characters in a room and seeing what happens. So  imagine a great white shark and a giant squid in the same bathroom. Or  sometimes I take them to places that people have never heard of because they're underwater. For instance  I took them skiing in the Mid Atlantic Range  which is this range of mountains in the middle of the Atlantic. I've taken them to the Sea of Japan  where they met giant jellyfish. I've taken them camping in the kelp forests of California. This next one here  I did a story on the census of marine life. And that was a lot of fun because  as most of you know  it's a real project we've heard about. But it was a chance for me to introduce readers to a lot of crazy undersea characters. So we start off the story with Ernest  who volunteers as a census taker. He goes down and he meets this famous anglerfish. Then he meets the yeti crab  the famous vampire squid    elusive  hard to find    and the Dumbo octopus  which looks so much like a cartoon in real life that really didn't have to change a thing when I drew it. I did another story on marine debris. I was speaking to a lot of my friends in the conservation business  and they    I asked them   So what's one issue you would like everyone to know more about   And they said    this one friend of mine said   I've got one word for you  plastic.  And I told him   Well  I need something a little sexier than that. Plastic just is not going to do it.  We sort of worked things out. He wanted me to use words like polyvinyl chloride  which doesn't really work in voice balloons very well. I couldn't fit them in. So what I did was I made an adventure strip. Basically  this bottle travels a long way. What I'm trying to tell readers is that plastic doesn't really go away  it just continues to wash downstream. And a lot of it ends up washing into the ocean  which is a great story if you attach a couple characters to it  especially if they can't stand each other  like these two. So  I sent them to Boise  Idaho  where they dropped a plastic bottle into the Boise sewer system. And it ended up in the Boise River and then on to the Columbia River and then to the mouth of the Columbia and to the Pacific Ocean and then on to this place called the Great Pacific Garbage Patch    which is this giant Pacific gyre in the North Pacific  where a lot of this plastic ends up floating around    and then back onto the lagoon. So that was basically a buddy story with a plastic bottle following along. So a lot of people remember the plastic bottle anyway  but we really talked about marine debris and plastic in the course of that one. The third storyline I did about a year and a half ago was probably my most difficult. It was on shark finning  and I felt really strongly about this issue. And I felt like  since my main character was a shark  the comic strip was a perfect vehicle for telling the public about this. Now  finning is the act of taking a shark  cutting the valuable fins off and throwing the live animal back in the water. It's cruel  it's wasteful. There's nothing funny or entertaining about it  but I really wanted to take this issue on. I had to kill my main character  who is a shark. We start with Sherman in a Chinese restaurant  who gets a fortune that he's about to get caught by a trawler  which he does. And then he dies. He gets finned  and then he gets thrown overboard. Ostensibly  he's dead now. And so I killed a character that's been in the newspaper for    years. So I got a lot of reader feedback on that one. Meanwhile  the other characters are talking about shark fin soup. I do three or four strips after that where we explore the finning issue and the shark fin soup issue. Sherman's up in shark heaven. This is what I love about comic strips  you know. You really don't have to worry about the audience suspending its sense of disbelief because  if you start with a talking shark  readers pretty much check their disbelief at the door. You can kind of do anything. It becomes a near death experience for Sherman. Meanwhile  Ernest finds his fins on the internet. There was a real website based in China that actually sold shark fins  so I kind of exposed that. And he clicks the  buy now  button. And voila  next day air  they show up  and they surgically reattach them. I ended that series with a kind of a mail in petition that encouraged our National Marine Fishery Service  to force other countries to have a stronger stance with shark management. Thanks. I'd like to end with a little metaphor here. I've been trying to think of a metaphor to represent Mission Blue  and this is what I came up with. Imagine you're in an enormous room  and it's as dark as a cave. And you can have anything in that room  anything you want  but you can't see anything. You've been given one tool  a hammer. So you wander around in the darkness  and you bump into something  and it feels like it's made of stone. It's big  it's heavy. You can't carry it away  so you bang it with your hammer  and you break off a piece. And you take the piece out into the daylight. And you see you have a beautiful piece of white alabaster. So you say to yourself   Well  that's worth something.  So you go back into the room  and you break this thing to pieces  and you haul it away. And you find other things  and you break that up  and you haul those away. And you're getting all kinds of cool stuff. And you hear other people doing the same thing. So you get this sense of urgency  like you need to find as much stuff as possible as soon as possible. And then some yells   Stop   And they turn up the lights. And you realize where you are  you're in the Louvre. And you've taken all this complexity and beauty  and you've turned it into a cheap commodity. And that's what we're doing with the ocean. And part of what Mission Blue is about is yelling   Stop   so that each of us    explorer  scientist  cartoonist  singer  chef    can turn up the lights in their own way. And that's what I hope my comic strip does in a small way. That's why I like what I do. Thanks for listening. So I'm going to talk to you about you about the political chemistry of oil spills and why this is an incredibly important  long  oily  hot summer  and why we need to keep ourselves from getting distracted. But before I talk about the political chemistry  I actually need to talk about the chemistry of oil. This is a photograph from when I visited Prudhoe Bay in Alaska in      to watch the Minerals Management Service testing their ability to burn oil spills in ice. And what you see here is  you see a little bit of crude oil  you see some ice cubes  and you see two sandwich baggies of napalm. The napalm is burning there quite nicely. And the thing is  is that oil is really an abstraction for us as the American consumer. We're four percent of the world's population  we use    percent of the world's oil production. And we don't really understand what oil is  until you check out its molecules  And you don't really understand that until you see this stuff burn. So this is what happens as that burn gets going. It takes off. It's a big woosh. I highly recommend that you get a chance to see crude oil burn someday  because you will never need to hear another poli sci lecture on the geopolitics of oil again. It'll just bake your retinas. So there it is  the retinas are baking. Let me tell you a little bit about this chemistry of oil. Oil is a stew of hydrocarbon molecules. It starts of with the very small ones  which are one carbon  four hydrogen    that's methane    it just floats off. Then there's all sorts of intermediate ones with middle amounts of carbon. You've probably heard of benzene rings  they're very carcinogenic. And it goes all the way over to these big  thick  galumphy ones that have hundreds of carbons  and they have thousands of hydrogens  and they have vanadium and heavy metals and sulfur and all kinds of craziness hanging off the sides of them. Those are called the asphaltenes  they're an ingredient in asphalt. They're very important in oil spills. Let me tell you a little bit about the chemistry of oil in water. It is this chemistry that makes oil so disastrous. Oil doesn't sink  it floats. If it sank  it would be a whole different story as far as an oil spill. And the other thing it does is it spreads out the moment it hits the water. It spreads out to be really thin  so you have a hard time corralling it. The next thing that happens is the light ends evaporate  and some of the toxic things float into the water column and kill fish eggs and smaller fish and things like that  and shrimp. And then the asphaltenes    and this is the crucial thing    the asphaltenes get whipped by the waves into a frothy emulsion  something like mayonnaise. It triples the amount of oily  messy goo that you have in the water  and it makes it very hard to handle. It also makes it very viscous. When the Prestige sank off the coast of Spain  there were big  floating cushions the size of sofa cushions of emulsified oil  with the consistency  or the viscosity  of chewing gum. It's incredibly hard to clean up. And every single oil is different when it hits water. When the chemistry of the oil and water also hits our politics  it's absolutely explosive. For the first time  American consumers will kind of see the oil supply chain in front of themselves. They have a  eureka   moment  when we suddenly understand oil in a different context. So I'm going to talk just a little bit about the origin of these politics  because it's really crucial to understanding why this summer is so important  why we need to stay focused. Nobody gets up in the morning and thinks   Wow  I'm going to go buy some three carbon to    carbon molecules to put in my tank and drive happily to work.  No  they think   Ugh. I have to go buy gas. I'm so angry about it. The oil companies are ripping me off. They set the prices  and I don't even know. I am helpless over this.  And this is what happens to us at the gas pump    and actually  gas pumps are specifically designed to diffuse that anger. You might notice that many gas pumps  including this one  are designed to look like ATMs. I've talked to engineers. That's specifically to diffuse our anger  because supposedly we feel good about ATMs. That shows you how bad it is. But actually  I mean  this feeling of helplessness comes in because most Americans actually feel that oil prices are the result of a conspiracy  not of the vicissitudes of the world oil market. And the thing is  too  is that we also feel very helpless about the amount that we consume  which is somewhat reasonable  because in fact  we have designed this system where  if you want to get a job  it's much more important to have a car that runs  to have a job and keep a job  than to have a GED. And that's actually very perverse. Now there's another perverse thing about the way we buy gas  which is that we'd rather be doing anything else. This is BP's gas station in downtown Los Angeles. It is green. It is a shrine to greenishness.  Now   you think   why would something so lame work on people so smart   Well  the reason is  is because  when we're buying gas  we're very invested in this sort of cognitive dissonance. I mean  we're angry at the one hand and we want to be somewhere else. We don't want to be buying oil  we want to be doing something green. And we get kind of in on our own con. I mean    and this is funny  it looks funny here. But in fact  that's why the slogan  beyond petroleum  worked. But it's an inherent part of our energy policy  which is we don't talk about reducing the amount of oil that we use. We talk about energy independence. We talk about hydrogen cars. We talk about biofuels that haven't been invented yet. And so  cognitive dissonance is part and parcel of the way that we deal with oil  and it's really important to dealing with this oil spill. Okay  so the politics of oil are very moral in the United States. The oil industry is like a huge  gigantic octopus of engineering and finance and everything else  but we actually see it in very moral terms. This is an early on photograph    you can see  we had these gushers. Early journalists looked at these spills  and they said   This is a filthy industry.  But they also saw in it that people were getting rich for doing nothing. They weren't farmers  they were just getting rich for stuff coming out of the ground. It's the  Beverly Hillbillies   basically. But in the beginning  this was seen as a very morally problematic thing  long before it became funny. And then  of course  there was John D. Rockefeller. And the thing about John D. is that he went into this chaotic wild east of oil industry  and he rationalized it into a vertically integrated company  a multinational. It was terrifying  you think Walmart is a terrifying business model now  imagine what this looked like in the     s or     s. And it also the kind of root of how we see oil as a conspiracy. But what's really amazing is that Ida Tarbell  the journalist  went in and did a big expos  of Rockefeller and actually got the whole antitrust laws put in place. But in many ways  that image of the conspiracy still sticks with us. And here's one of the things that Ida Tarbell said    she said   He has a thin nose like a thorn. There were no lips. There were puffs under the little colorless eyes with creases running from them.  Okay  so that guy is actually still with us. I mean  this is a very pervasive    this is part of our DNA. And then there's this guy  okay. So  you might be wondering why it is that  every time we have high oil prices or an oil spill  we call these CEOs down to Washington  and we sort of pepper them with questions in public and we try to shame them. And this is something that we've been doing since       when we first asked them   Why are there these obscene profits   And we've sort of personalized the whole oil industry into these CEOs. And we take it as  you know    we look at it on a moral level  rather than looking at it on a legal and financial level. And so I'm not saying these guys aren't liable to answer questions    I'm just saying that  when you focus on whether they are or are not a bunch of greedy bastards  you don't actually get around to the point of making laws that are either going to either change the way they operate  or you're going to get around to really reducing the amount of oil and reducing our dependence on oil. So I'm saying this is kind of a distraction. But it makes for good theater  and it's powerfully cathartic as you probably saw last week. So the thing about water oil spills is that they are very politically galvanizing. I mean  these pictures    this is from the Santa Barbara spill. You have these pictures of birds. They really influence people. When the Santa Barbara spill happened in       it formed the environmental movement in its modern form. It started Earth Day. It also put in place the National Environmental Policy Act  the Clean Air Act  the Clean Water Act. Everything that we are really stemmed from this period. I think it's important to kind of look at these pictures of the birds and understand what happens to us. Here we are normally  we're standing at the gas pump  and we're feeling kind of helpless. We look at these pictures and we understand  for the first time  our role in this supply chain. We connect the dots in the supply chain. And we have this kind of    as voters  we have kind of a  eureka   moment. This is why these moments of these oil spills are so important. But it's also really important that we don't get distracted by the theater or the morals of it. We actually need to go in and work on the roots of the problem. One of the things that happened with the two previous oil spills was that we really worked on some of the symptoms. We were very reactive  as opposed to being proactive about what happened. And so what we did was  actually  we made moratoriums on the east and west coasts on drilling. We stopped drilling in ANWR  but we didn't actually reduce the amount of oil that we consumed. In fact  it's continued to increase. The only thing that really reduces the amount of oil that we consume is much higher prices. As you can see  our own production has fallen off as our reservoirs have gotten old and expensive to drill out. We only have two percent of the world's oil reserves     percent of them are in the Persian Gulf. One of the things that's happened because of this is that  since       the country of Nigeria  or the part of Nigeria that pumps oil  which is the delta    which is two times the size of Maryland    has had thousands of oil spills a year. I mean  we've essentially been exporting oil spills when we import oil from places without tight environmental regulations. That has been the equivalent of an Exxon Valdez spill every year since     . And we can wrap our heads around the spills  because that's what we see here  but in fact  these guys actually live in a war zone. There's a thousand battle related deaths a year in this area twice the size of Maryland  and it's all related to the oil. And these guys  I mean  if they were in the U.S.  they might be actually here in this room. They have degrees in political science  degrees in business    they're entrepreneurs. They don't actually want to be doing what they're doing. And it's sort of one of the other groups of people who pay a price for us. The other thing that we've done  as we've continued to increase demand  is that we kind of play a shell game with the costs. One of the places we put in a big oil project in Chad  with Exxon. So the U.S. taxpayer paid for it  the World Bank  Exxon paid for it. We put it in. There was a tremendous banditry problem. I was there in     . We were driving along this dark  dark road  and the guy in the green stepped out  and I was just like   Ahhh  This is it.  And then the guy in the Exxon uniform stepped out  and we realized it was okay. They have their own private sort of army around them at the oil fields. But at the same time  Chad has become much more unstable  and we are not paying for that price at the pump. We pay for it in our taxes on April   th. We do the same thing with the price of policing the Persian Gulf and keeping the shipping lanes open. This is         we actually bombed two Iranian oil platforms that year. That was the beginning of an escalating U.S. involvement there that we do not pay for at the pump. We pay for it on April   th  and we can't even calculate the cost of this involvement. The other place that is sort of supporting our dependence on oil and our increased consumption is the Gulf of Mexico  which was not part of the moratoriums. Now what's happened in the Gulf of Mexico    as you can see  this is the Minerals Management diagram of wells for gas and oil. It's become this intense industrialized zone. It doesn't have the same resonance for us that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has  but it should  I mean  it's a bird sanctuary. Also  every time you buy gasoline in the United States  half of it is actually being refined along the coast  because the Gulf actually has about    percent of our refining capacity and a lot of our marine terminals as well. So the people of the Gulf have essentially been subsidizing the rest of us through a less clean environment. And finally  American families also pay a price for oil. Now on the one hand  the price at the pump is not really very high when you consider the actual cost of the oil  but on the other hand  the fact that people have no other transit options means that they pay a large amount of their income into just getting back and forth to work  generally in a fairly crummy car. If you look at people who make         a year  they have two kids  they might have three jobs or more  and then they have to really commute. They're actually spending more on their car and fuel than they are on taxes or on health care. And the same thing happens at the   th percentile  around       . Gasoline costs are a tremendous drain on the American economy  but they're also a drain on individual families and it's kind of terrifying to think about what happens when prices get higher. So  what I'm going to talk to you about now is  what do we have to do this time  What are the laws  What do we have to do to keep ourselves focused  One thing is    we need to stay away from the theater. We need to stay away from the moratoriums. We need to focus really back again on the molecules. The moratoriums are fine  but we do need to focus on the molecules on the oil. One of the things that we also need to do  is we need to try to not kind of fool ourselves into thinking that you can have a green world  before you reduce the amount of oil that we use. We need to focus on reducing the oil. What you see in this top drawing is a schematic of how petroleum gets used in the U.S. economy. It comes in on the side    the useful stuff is the dark gray  and the un useful stuff  which is called the rejected energy    the waste  goes up to the top. Now you can see that the waste far outweighs the actually useful amount. And one of the things that we need to do is  not only fix the fuel efficiency of our vehicles and make them much more efficient  but we also need to fix the economy in general. We need to remove the perverse incentives to use more fuel. For example  we have an insurance system where the person who drives        miles a year pays the same insurance as somebody who drives      . We actually encourage people to drive more. We have policies that reward sprawl    we have all kinds of policies. We need to have more mobility choices. We need to make the gas price better reflect the real cost of oil. And we need to shift subsidies from the oil industry  which is at least    billion dollars a year  into something that allows middle class people to find better ways to commute. Whether that's getting a much more efficient car and also kind of building markets for new cars and new fuels down the road  this is where we need to be. We need to kind of rationalize this whole thing  and you can find more about this policy. It's called STRONG  which is  Secure Transportation Reducing Oil Needs Gradually   and the idea is instead of being helpless  we need to be more strong. They're up at NewAmerica.net. What's important about these is that we try to move from feeling helpless at the pump  to actually being active and to really sort of thinking about who we are  having kind of that special moment  where we connect the dots actually at the pump. Now supposedly  oil taxes are the third rail of American politics    the no fly zone. I actually    I agree that a dollar a gallon on oil is probably too much  but I think that if we started this year with three cents a gallon on gasoline  and upped it to six cents next year  nine cents the following year  all the way up to    cents by       that we could actually significantly reduce our gasoline consumption  and at the same time we would give people time to prepare  time to respond  and we would be raising money and raising consciousness at the same time. Let me give you a little sense of how this would work. This is a gas receipt  hypothetically  for a year from now. The first thing that you have on the tax is    you have a tax for a stronger America       cents. So you're not helpless at the pump. And the second thing that you have is a kind of warning sign  very similar to what you would find on a cigarette pack. And what it says is   The National Academy of Sciences estimates that every gallon of gas you burn in your car creates    cents in health care costs.  That's a lot. And so this    you can see that you're paying considerably less than the health care costs on the tax. And also  the hope is that you start to be connected to the whole greater system. And at the same time  you have a number that you can call to get more information on commuting  or a low interest loan on a different kind of car  or whatever it is you're going to need to actually reduce your gasoline dependence. With this whole sort of suite of policies  we could actually reduce our gasoline consumption    or our oil consumption    by    percent by     . So  three million barrels a day. But in order to do this  one of the things we really need to do  is we need to remember we are people of the hydrocarbon. We need to keep or minds on the molecules and not get distracted by the theater  not get distracted by the cognitive dissonance of the green possibilities that are out there. We need to kind of get down and do the gritty work of reducing our dependence upon this fuel and these molecules. Thank you. So I work in marketing  which I love  but my first passion was physics  a passion brought to me by a wonderful school teacher  when I had a little less gray hair. So he taught me that physics is cool because it teaches us so much about the world around us. And I'm going to spend the next few minutes trying to convince you that physics can teach us something about marketing. So quick show of hands    who studied some marketing in university  Who studied some physics in university  Pretty good. And at school  Okay  lots of you. So  hopefully this will bring back some happy  or possibly some slightly disturbing memories. So  physics and marketing. We'll start with something very simple    Newton's Law   The force equals mass times acceleration.  This is something that perhaps Turkish Airlines should have studied a bit more carefully before they ran this campaign. But if we rearrange this formula quickly  we can get to acceleration equals force over mass  which means that for a larger particle    a larger mass    it requires more force to change its direction. It's the same with brands  the more massive a brand  the more baggage it has  the more force is needed to change its positioning. And that's one of the reasons why Arthur Andersen chose to launch Accenture rather than try to persuade the world that Andersen's could stand for something other than accountancy. It explains why Hoover found it very difficult to persuade the world that it was more than vacuum cleaners  and why companies like Unilever and P G keep brands separate  like Ariel and Pringles and Dove rather than having one giant parent brand. So the physics is that the bigger the mass of an object the more force is needed to change its direction. The marketing is  the bigger a brand  the more difficult it is to reposition it. So think about a portfolio of brands or maybe new brands for new ventures. Now  who remembers Heisenberg's uncertainty principle  Getting a little more technical now. So this says that it's impossible  by definition  to measure exactly the state    i.e.  the position    and the momentum of a particle  because the act of measuring it  by definition  changes it. So to explain that    if you've got an elementary particle and you shine a light on it  then the photon of light has momentum  which knocks the particle  so you don't know where it was before you looked at it. By measuring it  the act of measurement changes it. The act of observation changes it. It's the same in marketing. So with the act of observing consumers  changes their behavior. Think about the group of moms who are talking about their wonderful children in a focus group  and almost none of them buy lots of junk food. And yet  McDonald's sells hundreds of millions of burgers every year. Think about the people who are on accompanied shops in supermarkets  who stuff their trolleys full of fresh green vegetables and fruit  but don't shop like that any other day. And if you think about the number of people who claim in surveys to regularly look for porn on the Web  it's very few. Yet  at Google  we know it's the number one searched for category. So luckily  the science    no  sorry    the marketing is getting easier. Luckily  with now better point of sale tracking  more digital media consumption  you can measure more what consumers actually do  rather than what they say they do. So the physics is you can never accurately and exactly measure a particle  because the observation changes it. The marketing is    the message for marketing is    that try to measure what consumers actually do  rather than what they say they'll do or anticipate they'll do. So next  the scientific method    an axiom of physics  of all science    says you cannot prove a hypothesis through observation  you can only disprove it. What this means is you can gather more and more data around a hypothesis or a positioning  and it will strengthen it  but it will not conclusively prove it. And only one contrary data point can blow your theory out of the water. So if we take an example    Ptolemy had dozens of data points to support his theory that the planets would rotate around the Earth. It only took one robust observation from Copernicus to blow that idea out of the water. And there are parallels for marketing    you can invest for a long time in a brand  but a single contrary observation of that positioning will destroy consumers' belief. Take BP    they spent millions of pounds over many years building up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand  but then one little accident. Think about Toyota. It was  for a long time  revered as the most reliable of cars  and then they had the big recall incident. And Tiger Woods  for a long time  the perfect brand ambassador. Well  you know the story. So the physics is that you cannot prove a hypothesis  but it's easy to disprove it    any hypothesis is shaky. And the marketing is that not matter how much you've invested in your brand  one bad week can undermine decades of good work. So be really careful to try and avoid the screw ups that can undermine your brand. And lastly  to the slightly obscure world of entropy    the second law of thermodynamics. This says that entropy  which is a measure of the disorder of a system  will always increase. The same is true of marketing. If we go back    years  the one message pretty much controlled by one marketing manager could pretty much define a brand. But where we are today  things have changed. You can get a strong brand image or a message and put it out there like the Conservative Party did earlier this year with their election poster. But then you lose control of it. With the kind of digital comment creation and distribution tools that are available now to every consumer  it's impossible to control where it goes. Your brand starts being dispersed  it gets more chaotic. It's out of your control. I actually saw him speak    he did a good job. But while this may be unsettling for marketers  it's actually a good thing. This distribution of brand energy gets your brand closer to the people  more in with the people. It makes this distribution of energy a democratizing force  which is ultimately good for your brand. So  the lesson from physics is that entropy will always increase  it's a fundamental law. The message for marketing is that your brand is more dispersed. You can't fight it  so embrace it and find a way to work with it. So to close  my teacher  Mr. Vutter  told me that physics is cool  and hopefully  I've convinced you that physics can teach all of us  even in the world of marketing  something special. Thank you. Martin Luther King did not say   I have a nightmare   when he inspired the civil rights movements. He said   I have a dream.  And I have a dream. I have a dream that we can stop thinking that the future will be a nightmare  and this is going to be a challenge  because  if you think of every major blockbusting film of recent times  nearly all of its visions for humanity are apocalyptic. I think this film is one of the hardest watches of modern times   The Road.  It's a beautiful piece of filmmaking  but everything is desolate  everything is dead. And just a father and son trying to survive  walking along the road. And I think the environmental movement of which I am a part of has been complicit in creating this vision of the future. For too long  we have peddled a nightmarish vision of what's going to happen. We have focused on the worst case scenario. We have focused on the problems. And we have not thought enough about the solutions. We've used fear  if you like  to grab people's attention. And any psychologist will tell you that fear in the organism is linked to flight mechanism. It's part of the fight and flight mechanism  that when an animal is frightened    think of a deer. A deer freezes very  very still  poised to run away. And I think that's what we're doing when we're asking people to engage with our agenda around environmental degradation and climate change. People are freezing and running away because we're using fear. And I think the environmental movement has to grow up and start to think about what progress is. What would it be like to be improving the human lot  And one of the problems that we face  I think  is that the only people that have cornered the market in terms of progress is a financial definition of what progress is  an economic definition of what progress is    that somehow  if we get the right numbers to go up  we're going to be better off  whether that's on the stock market  whether that's with GDP and economic growth  that somehow life is going to get better. This is somehow appealing to human greed instead of fear    that more is better. Come on. In the Western world  we have enough. Maybe some parts of the world don't  but we have enough. And we've know for a long time that this is not a good measure of the welfare of nations. In fact  the architect of our national accounting system  Simon Kuznets  in the     s  said that   A nation's welfare can scarcely be inferred from their national income.  But we've created a national accounting system which is firmly based on production and producing stuff. And indeed  this is probably historical  and it had its time. In the second World War  we needed to produce a lot of stuff. And indeed  we were so successful at producing certain types of stuff that we destroyed a lot of Europe  and we had to rebuild it afterwards. And so our national accounting system became fixated on what we can produce. But as early as       this visionary man  Robert Kennedy  at the start of his ill fated presidential campaign  gave the most eloquent deconstruction of gross national product that ever has been. And he finished his talk with the phrase  that   The gross national product measures everything except that which makes life worthwhile.  How crazy is that  That our measure of progress  our dominant measure of progress in society  is measuring everything except that which makes life worthwhile  I believe  if Kennedy was alive today  he would be asking statisticians such as myself to go out and find out what makes life worthwhile. He'd be asking us to redesign our national accounting system to be based upon such important things as social justice  sustainability and people's well being. And actually  social scientists have already gone out and asked these questions around the world. This is from a global survey. It's asking people  what do they want. And unsurprisingly  people all around the world say that what they want is happiness  for themselves  for their families  their children  their communities. Okay  they think money is slightly important. It's there  but it's not nearly as important as happiness  and it's not nearly as important as love. We all need to love and be loved in life. It's not nearly as important as health. We want to be healthy and live a full life. These seem to be natural human aspirations. Why are statisticians not measuring these  Why are we not thinking of the progress of nations in these terms  instead of just how much stuff we have  And really  this is what I've done with my adult life    is think about how do we measure happiness  how do we measure well being  how can we do that within environmental limits. And we created  at the organization that I work for  the New Economics Foundation  something we call the Happy Planet Index  because we think people should be happy and the planet should be happy. Why don't we create a measure of progress that shows that  And what we do  is we say that the ultimate outcome of a nation is how successful is it at creating happy and healthy lives for its citizens. That should be the goal of every nation on the planet. But we have to remember that there's a fundamental input to that  and that is how many of the planet's resources we use. We all have one planet. We all have to share it. It is the ultimate scarce resource  the one planet that we share. And economics is very interested in scarcity. When it has a scarce resource that it wants to turn into a desirable outcome  it thinks in terms of efficiency. It thinks in terms of how much bang do we get for our buck. And this is a measure of how much well being we get for our planetary resource use. It is an efficiency measure. And probably the easiest way to show you that  is to show you this graph. Running horizontally along the graph  is  ecological footprint   which is a measure of how much resources we use and how much pressure we put on the planet. More is bad. Running vertically upwards  is a measure called  happy life years.  It's about the well being of nations. It's like a happiness adjusted life expectancy. It's like quality and quantity of life in nations. And the yellow dot there you see  is the global average. Now  there's a huge array of nations around that global average. To the top right of the graph  are countries which are doing reasonably well and producing well being  but they're using a lot of planet to get there. They are the U.S.A.  other Western countries going across in those triangles and a few Gulf states in there actually. Conversely  at the bottom left of the graph  are countries that are not producing much well being    typically  sub Saharan Africa. In Hobbesian terms  life is short and brutish there. The average life expectancy in many of these countries is only    years. Malaria  HIV AIDS are killing a lot of people in these regions of the world. But now for the good news  There are some countries up there  yellow triangles  that are doing better than global average  that are heading up towards the top left of the graph. This is an aspirational graph. We want to be top left  where good lives don't cost the earth. They're Latin American. The country on its own up at the top is a place I haven't been to. Maybe some of you have. Costa Rica. Costa Rica    average life expectancy is    and a half years. That is longer than in the USA. They are  according to the latest Gallup world poll  the happiest nation on the planet    than anybody  more than Switzerland and Denmark. They are the happiest place. They are doing that on a quarter of the resources that are used typically in  the  Western world    a quarter of the resources. What's going on there  What's happening in Costa Rica  We can look at some of the data.    percent of their electricity comes from renewable resources. Their government is one of the first to commit to be carbon neutral by     . They abolished the army in             . And they invested in social programs    health and education. They have one of the highest literacy rates in Latin America and in the world. And they have that Latin vibe  don't they. They have the social connectedness. The challenge is  that possibly    and the thing we might have to think about    is that the future might not be North American  might not be Western European. It might be Latin American. And the challenge  really  is to pull the global average up here. That's what we need to do. And if we're going to do that  we need to pull countries from the bottom  and we need to pull countries from the right of the graph. And then we're starting to create a happy planet. That's one way of looking at it. Another way of looking at it is looking at time trends. We don't have good data going back for every country in the world  but for some of the richest countries  the OECD group  we do. And this is the trend in well being over that time  a small increase  but this is the trend in ecological footprint. And so in strict happy planet methodology  we've become less efficient at turning our ultimate scarce resource into the outcome we want to. And the point really is  is that I think  probably everybody in this room would like society to get to      without an apocalyptic something happening. It's actually not very long away. It's half a human lifetime away. A child entering school today will be my age in     . This is not the very distant future. This is what the U.K. government target on carbon and greenhouse emissions looks like. And I put it to you  that is not business as usual. That is changing our business. That is changing the way we create our organizations  we do our government policy and we live our lives. And the point is  we need to carry on increasing well being. No one can go to the polls and say that quality of life is going to reduce. None of us  I think  want human progress to stop. I think we want it to carry on. I think we want the lot of humanity to keep on increasing. And I think this is where climate change skeptics and deniers come in. I think this is what they want. They want quality of life to keep increasing. They want to hold on to what they've got. And if we're going to engage them  I think that's what we've got to do. And that means we have to really increase efficiency even more. Now that's all very easy to draw graphs and things like that  but the point is we need to turn those curves. And this is where I think we can take a leaf out of systems theory  systems engineers  where they create feedback loops  put the right information at the right point of time. Human beings are very motivated by the  now.  You put a smart meter in your home  and you see how much electricity you're using right now  how much it's costing you  your kids go around and turn the lights off pretty quickly. What would that look like for society  Why is it  on the radio news every evening  I hear the FTSE      the Dow Jones  the dollar pound ratio    I don't even know which way the dollar pound ratio should go to be good news. And why do I hear that  Why don't I hear how much energy Britain used yesterday  or American used yesterday  Did we meet our three percent annual target on reducing carbon emissions  That's how you create a collective goal. You put it out there into the media and start thinking about it. And we need positive feedback loops for increasing well being At a government level  they might create national accounts of well being. At a business level  you might look at the well being of your employees  which we know is really linked to creativity  which is linked to innovation  and we're going to need a lot of innovation to deal with those environmental issues. At a personal level  we need these nudges too. Maybe we don't quite need the data  but we need reminders. In the U.K.  we have a strong public health message on five fruit and vegetables a day and how much exercise we should do    never my best thing. What are these for happiness  What are the five things that you should do every day to be happier  We did a project for the Government Office of Science a couple of years ago  a big program called the Foresight program    lots and lots of people    involved lots of experts    everything evidence based    a huge tome. But a piece of work we did was on  what five positive actions can you do to improve well being in your life  And the point of these is they are  not quite  the secrets of happiness  but they are things that I think happiness will flow out the side from. And the first of these is to connect  is that your social relationships are the most important cornerstones of your life. Do you invest the time with your loved ones that you could do  and energy  Keep building them. The second one is be active. The fastest way out of a bad mood  step outside  go for a walk  turn the radio on and dance. Being active is great for our positive mood. The third one is take notice. How aware are you of things going on around the world  the seasons changing  people around you  Do you notice what's bubbling up for you and trying to emerge  Based on a lot of evidence for mindfulness  cognitive behavioral therapy   very  strong for our well being. The fourth is keep learning and keep is important    learning throughout the whole life course. Older people who keep learning and are curious  they have much better health outcomes than those who start to close down. But it doesn't have to be formal learning  it's not knowledge based. It's more curiosity. It can be learning to cook a new dish  picking up an instrument you forgot as a child. Keep learning. And the final one is that most anti economic of activities  but give. Our generosity  our altruism  our compassion  are all hardwired to the reward mechanism in our brain. We feel good if we give. You can do an experiment where you give two groups of people a hundred dollars in the morning. You tell one of them to spend it on themselves and one on other people. You measure their happiness at the end of the day  those that have gone and spent on other people are much happier that those that spent it on themselves. And these five ways  which we put onto these handy postcards  I would say  don't have to cost the earth. They don't have any carbon content. They don't need a lot of material goods to be satisfied. And so I think it's really quite feasible that happiness does not cost the earth. Now  Martin Luther King  on the eve of his death  gave an incredible speech. He said   I know there are challenges ahead  there may be trouble ahead  but I fear no one. I don't care. I have been to the mountain top  and I have seen the Promised Land.  Now  he was a preacher  but I believe the environmental movement and  in fact  the business community  government  needs to go to the top of the mountain top  and it needs to look out  and it needs to see the Promised Land  or the land of promise  and it needs to have a vision of a world that we all want. And not only that  we need to create a Great Transition to get there  and we need to pave that great transition with good things. Human beings want to be happy. Pave them with the five ways. And we need to have signposts gathering people together and pointing them    something like the Happy Planet Index. And then I believe that we can all create a world we all want  where happiness does not cost the earth. We live on a human dominated planet  putting unprecedented pressure on the systems on Earth. This is bad news  but perhaps surprising to you  it's also part of the good news. We're the first generation    thanks to science    to be informed that we may be undermining the stability and the ability of planet Earth to support human development as we know it. It's also good news  because the planetary risks we're facing are so large  that business as usual is not an option. In fact  we're in a phase where transformative change is necessary  which opens the window for innovation  for new ideas and new paradigms. This is a scientific journey on the challenges facing humanity in the global phase of sustainability. On this journey  I'd like to bring  apart from yourselves  a good friend  a stakeholder  who's always absent when we deal with the negotiations on environmental issues  a stakeholder who refuses to compromise    planet Earth. So I thought I'd bring her with me today on stage  to have her as a witness of a remarkable journey  which humbly reminds us of the period of grace we've had over the past        years. This is the living conditions on the planet over the last         years. It's a very important period    it's roughly half the period when we've been fully modern humans on the planet. We've had the same  roughly  abilities that developed civilizations as we know it. This is the environmental conditions on the planet. Here  used as a proxy  temperature variability. It was a jumpy ride.        years back in a crisis  we leave Africa  we colonize Australia in another crisis         years back  we leave Asia for Europe in another crisis         years back  and then we enter the remarkably stable Holocene phase  the only period in the whole history of the planet  that we know of  that can support human development. A thousand years into this period  we abandon our hunting and gathering patterns. We go from a couple of million people to the seven billion people we are today. The Mesopotamian culture  we invent agriculture  we domesticate animals and plants. You have the Roman  the Greek and the story as you know it. The only phase  as we know it that can support humanity. The trouble is we're putting a quadruple sqeeze on this poor planet  a quadruple sqeeze  which  as its first squeeze  has population growth of course. Now  this is not only about numbers  this is not only about the fact that we're seven billion people committed to nine billion people  it's an equity issue as well. The majority of the environmental impacts on the planet have been caused by the rich minority  the    percent that jumped onto the industrial bandwagon in the mid   th century. The majority of the planet  aspiring for development  having the right for development  are in large aspiring for an unsustainable lifestyle  a momentous pressure. The second pressure on the planet is  of course the climate agenda    the big issue    where the policy interpretation of science is that it would be enough to stabilize greenhouse gases at     ppm to avoid average temperatures exceeding two degrees  to avoid the risk that we may be destabilizing the West Antarctic Ice Sheet  holding six meters    level rising  the risk of destabilizing the Greenland Ice Sheet  holding another seven meters    sea level rising. Now  you would have wished the climate pressure to hit a strong planet  a resilient planet  but unfortunately  the third pressure is the ecosystem decline. Never have we seen  in the past    years  such a sharp decline of ecosystem functions and services on the planet  one of them being the ability to regulate climate on the long term  in our forests  land and biodiversity. The forth pressure is surprise  the notion and the evidence that we need to abandon our old paradigm  that ecosystems behave linearly  predictably  controllably in our    so to say    linear systems  and that in fact  surprise is universal  as systems tip over very rapidly  abruptly and often irreversibly. This  dear friends  poses a human pressure on the planet of momentous scale. We may  in fact  have entered a new geological era    the Anthropocene  where humans are the predominant driver of change at a planetary level. Now  as a scientist  what's the evidence for this  Well  the evidence is  unfortunately  ample. It's not only carbon dioxide that has this hockey stick pattern of accelerated change. You can take virtually any parameter that matters for human well being    nitrous oxide  methane  deforestation  overfishing land degredation  loss of species    they all show the same pattern over the past     years. Simultaneously  they branch off in the mid   s     years after the Second World War  showing very clearly that the great acceleration of the human enterprise starts in the mid   s. You see  for the first time  an imprint on the global level. And I can tell you  you enter the disciplinary research in each of these  you find something remarkably important  the conclusion that we may have come to the point where we have to bend the curves  that we may have entered the most challenging and exciting decade in the history humanity on the planet  the decade when we have to bend the curves. Now  as if this was not enough    to just bend the curves and understanding the accelerated pressure on the planet    we also have to recognize the fact that systems do have multiple stable states  separated by thresholds    illustrated here by this ball and cup diagram  where the depth of the cup is the resilience of the system. Now  the system may gradually    under pressure of climate change  erosion  biodiversity loss    lose the depth of the cup  the resilience  but appear to be healthy and appear to suddenly  under a threshold  be tipping over. Upff. Sorry. Changing state and literally ending up in an undesired situation  where new biophysical logic takes over  new species take over  and the system gets locked. Do we have evidence of this  Yes  coral reef systems. Biodiverse  low nutrient  hard coral systems under multiple pressures of overfishing  unsustainable tourism  climate change. A trigger and the system tips over  loses its resilience  soft corals take over  and we get undesired systems that cannot support economic and social development. The Arctic    a beautiful system    a regulating biome at the planetary level  taking the knock after knock on climate change  appearing to be in a good state. No scientist could predict that in       suddenly  what could be crossing a threshold. The system suddenly  very surprisingly  loses    to    percent of its summer ice cover. And the drama is  of course  that when the system does this  the logic may change. It may get locked in an undesired state  because it changes color  absorbs more energy  and the system may get stuck. In my mind  the largest red flag warning for humanity that we are in a precarious situation. As a sideline  you know that the only red flag that popped up here was a submarine from an unnamed country that planted a red flag at the bottom of the Arctic to be able to control the oil resources. Now  if we have evidence  which we now have  that wetlands  forests   unclear  monsoon system  the rainforests  behave in this nonlinear way.    or so scientists around the world gathered and asked a question for the first time   Do we have to put the planet into the the pot   So we have to ask ourselves  are we threatening this extraordinarily stable Holocene state  Are we in fact putting ourselves in a situation where we're coming too close to thresholds that could lead to deleterious and very undesired  if now catastrophic  change for human development  You know  you don't want to stand there. In fact  you're not even allowed to stand where this gentleman is standing  at the foaming  slippery waters at the threshold. In fact  there's a fence quite upstream of this threshold  beyond which you are in a danger zone. And this is the new paradigm  which we gathered two  three years back  recognizing that our old paradigm of just analyzing and pushing and predicting parameters into the future  aiming at minimalizing environmental impacts  is of the past. Now we to ask ourselves  which are the large environmental processes that we have to be stewards of to keep ourselves safe in the Holocene  And could we even  thanks to major advancements in Earth systems science  identify the thresholds  the points where we may expect nonlinear change  And could we even define a planetary boundary  a fence  within which we then have a safe operating space for humanity  This work  which was published in  Nature   late       after a number of years of analysis  led to the final proposition that we can only find nine planetary boundaries with which  under active stewardship  would allow ourselves to have a safe operating space. These include  of course  climate. It may surprise you that it's not only climate. But it shows that we are interconnected  among many systems on the planet  with the three big systems  climate change  stratospheric ozone depletion and ocean acidification being the three big systems  where the scientific evidence of large scale thresholds in the paleo record of the history of the planet. But we also include  what we call  the slow variables  the systems that  under the hood  regulate and buffer the capacity of the resilience of the planet    the interference of the big nitrogen and phosphorus cycles on the planet  land use change  rate of biodiversity loss  freshwater use  functions which regulate biomass on the planet  carbon sequestration  diversity. And then we have two parameters which we were not able to quantify    air pollution  including warming gases and air polluting sulfates and nitrates  but also chemical pollution. Together  these form an integrated whole for guiding human development in the Anthropocene  understanding that the planet is a complex self regulating system. In fact  most evidence indicates that these nine may behave as three Musketeers   One for all. All for one.  You degrade forests  you go beyond the boundary on land  you undermine the ability of the climate system to stay stable. The drama here is  in fact  that it may show that the climate challenge is the easy one  if you consider the whole challenge of sustainable development. Now this is the Big Bang equivalent then of human development within the safe operating space of the planetary boundaries. What you see here in black line is the safe operating space  the quantified boundaries  as suggested by this analysis. The yellow dot in the middle here is our starting point  the pre industrial point  where we're very safely in the safe operating space. In the '  s  we start branching out. In the '  s already  through the green revolution and the Haber Bosch process of fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere    you know  human's today take out more nitrogen from the atmosphere than the whole biosphere does naturally as a whole. We don't transgress the climate boundary until the early '  s  actually  right after Rio. And today  we are in a situation where we estimate that we've transgressed three boundaries  the rate of biodiversity loss  which is the sixth extinction period in the history of humanity    one of them being the extinctions of the dinosaurs    nitrogen and climate change. But we still have some degrees of freedom on the others  but we are approaching fast on land  water  phosphorus and oceans. But this gives a new paradigm to guide humanity  to put the light on our  so far overpowered industrial vehicle  which operates as if we're only on a dark  straight highway. Now the question then is  how gloomy is this  Is then sustainable development utopia  Well  there's no science to suggest. In fact  there is ample science to indicate that we can do this transformative change  that we have the ability to now move into a new innovative  a transformative gear  across scales. The drama is  of course  is that     countries on this planet have to simultaneously start moving in the same direction. But it changes fundamentally our governance and management paradigm  from the current linear  command and control thinking  looking at efficiencies and optimization towards a much more flexible  a much more adaptive approach  where we recognize that redundancy  both in social and environmental systems  is key to be able to deal with a turbulent era of global change. We have to invest in persistence  in the ability of social systems and ecological systems to withstand shocks and still remain in that desired cup. We have to invest in transformations capability  moving from crisis into innovation and the ability to rise after a crisis  and of course to adapt to unavoidable change. This is a new paradigm. We're not doing that at any scale on governance. But is it happening anywhere  Do we have any examples of success on this mind shift being applied at the local level  Well  yes  in fact we do and the list can start becoming longer and longer. There's good news here  for example  from Latin America  where plow based farming systems of the '  s and '  s led farming basically to a dead end  with lower and lower yields  degrading the organic matter and fundamental problems at the livelihood levels in Paraguay  Uruguay and a number of countries  Brazil  leading to innovation and entrepreneurship among farmers in partnership with scientists into an agricultural revolution of zero tillage systems combined with mulch farming with locally adapted technologies  which today  for example  in some countries  have led to a tremendous increase in area under mulch  zero till farming which  not only produces more food  but also sequesters carbon. The Australian Great Barrier Reef is another success story. Under the realization from tourist operators  fishermen  the Australian Great Barrier Reef Authority and scientists that the Great Barrier Reef is doomed under the current governance regime. Global change  beautification rack culture  overfishing and unsustainable tourism  all together placing this system in the realization of crisis. But the window of opportunity was innovation and new mindset  which today has led to a completely new governance strategy to build resilience  acknowledge redundancy and invest in the whole system as an integrated whole  and then allow for much more redundancy in the system. Sweden  the country I come from  has other examples  where wetlands in southern Sweden were seen as    as in many countries    as flood prone polluted nuisance in the peri urban regions. But again  a crisis  new partnerships  actors locally  transforming these into a key component of sustainable urban planning. So crisis leading into opportunities. Now  what about the future  Well  the future  of course  has one massive challenge  which is feeding a world of nine billion people. We need nothing less than a new green revolution  and the planet boundaries shows that agriculture has to go from a source of greenhouse gases to a sink. It has to basically do this on current land. We cannot expand anymore  because it erodes the planetary boundaries. We cannot continue consuming water as we do today  with    percent of world rivers not even reaching the ocean. And we need a transformation. Well  interestingly  and based on my work and others in Africa  for example  we've shown that even the most vulnerable small scale rainfall farming systems  with innovations and supplementary irrigation to bridge dry spells and droughts  sustainable sanitation systems to close the loop on nutrients from toilets back to farmers' fields  and innovations in tillage systems  we can triple  quadruple  yield levels on current land. Elinor Ostrom  the latest Nobel laureate of economics  clearly shows empirically across the world that we can govern the commons if we invest in trust  local  action based partnerships and cross scale institutional innovations  where local actors  together  can deal with the global commons at a large scale. But even on the hard policy area we have innovations. We know that we have to move from our fossil dependence very quickly into a low carbon economy in record time. And what shall we do  Everybody talks about carbon taxes    it won't work    emission schemes  but for example  one policy measure  feed in tariffs on the energy system  which is already applied  from China doing it on offshore wind systems  all the way to the U.S. where you give the guaranteed price for investment in renewable energy  but you can subsidize electricity to poor people. You get people out of poverty. You solve the climate issue with regards to the energy sector  while at the same time  stimulating innovation    examples of things that can be out scaled quickly at the planetary level. So there is    no doubt    opportunity here  and we can list many  many examples of transformative opportunities around the planet. The key though in all of these  the red thread  is the shift in mindset  moving away from a situation where we simply are pushing ourselves into a dark future  where we instead backcast our future  and we say   What is the playing field on the planet  What are the planetary boundaries within which we can safely operate   and then backtrack innovations within that. But of course  the drama is  it clearly shows that incremental change is not an option. So  there is scientific evidence. They sort of say the harsh news  that we are facing the largest transformative development since the industrialization. In fact  what we have to do over the next    years is much more dramatic and more exciting than what we did when we moved into the situation we're in today. Now  science indicates that  yes  we can achieve a prosperous future within the safe operating space  if we move simultaneously  collaborating on a global level  from local to global scale  in transformative options  which build resilience on a finite planet. Thank you. Tyler Dewar  The way I feel right now is that all of the other speakers have said exactly what I wanted to say. And it seems that the only thing left for me to say is to thank you all for your kindness. TD  But maybe in the spirit of appreciating the kindness of you all  I could share with you a little story about myself. TD  From the time I was very young  onward  I was given a lot of different responsibilities  and it always seemed to me  when I was young  that everything was laid out before me. All of the plans for me were already made. I was given the clothes that I needed to wear and told where I needed to be  given these very precious and holy looking robes to wear  with the understanding that it was something sacred or important. TD  But before that kind of formal lifestyle happened for me  I was living in eastern Tibet with my family. And when I was seven years old  all of a sudden  a search party arrived at my home. They were looking the next Karmapa  and I noticed they were talking to my mom and dad  and the news came to me that they were telling me that I was the Karmapa. And these days  people ask me a lot  how did that feel. How did that feel when they came and whisked you away  and your lifestyle completely changed  And what I mostly say is that  at that time  it was a pretty interesting idea to me. I thought that things would be pretty fun and there would be more things to play with. TD  But it didn't turn out to be so fun and entertaining  as I thought it would have been. I was placed in a pretty strictly controlled environment. And immediately  a lot of different responsibilities  in terms of my education and so forth  were heaped upon me. I was separated  largely  from my family  including my mother and father. I didn't have have many personal friends to spend time with  but I was expected to perform these prescribed duties. So it turned out that my fantasy about an entertaining life of being the Karmapa wasn't going to come true. It more felt to be the case to me that I was being treated like a statue  and I was to sit in one place like a statue would. TD  Nevertheless  I felt that  even though I've been separated from my loved ones    and  of course  now I'm even further away. When I was     I escaped from Tibet and became even further removed from my mother and father  my relatives  my friends and my homeland. But nevertheless  there's no real sense of separation from me in my heart  in terms of the love that I feel for these people. I feel  still  a very strong connection of love for all of these people and for the land. TD  And I still do get to keep in touch with my mother and father  albeit infrequently. I talk to my mother once in a blue moon on the telephone. And my experience is that  when I'm talking to her  with every second that passes during our conversation  the feeling of love that binds us is bringing us closer and closer together. TD  So those were just a few remarks about my personal background. And in terms of other things that I wanted to share with you  in terms of ideas  I think it's wonderful to have a situation like this  where so many people from different backgrounds and places can come together  exchange their ideas and form relationships of friendship with each other. And I think that's symbolic of what we're seeing in the world in general  that the world is becoming smaller and smaller  and that all of the peoples in the world are enjoying more opportunities for connection. That's wonderful  but we should also remember that we should have a similar process happening on the inside. Along with outward development and increase of opportunity  there should be inward development and deepening of our heart connections as well as our outward connections. So we spoke and we heard some about design this week. I think that it's important for us to remember that we need to keep pushing forward on the endeavor of the design of the heart. We heard a lot about technology this week  and it's important for us to remember to invest a lot of our energy in improving the technology of the heart. TD  So  even though I'm somewhat happy about the wonderful developments that are happening in the world  still  I feel a sense of impediment  when it comes to the ability that we have to connect with each other on a heart to heart  or a mind to mind  level. I feel that there are some things that are getting in the way. TC  My relationship to this concept of heart to heart connection  or mind to mind connection  is an interesting one  because  as a spiritual leader  I'm always attempting to open my heart to others and offer myself up for heart to heart and mind to mind connections in a genuine way with other people  but at the same time  I've always been advised that I need to emphasize intelligence over the heart to heart connections  because  being someone in a position like mine  if I don't rely primarily on intelligence  then something dangerous may happen to me. So it's an interesting paradox at play there. But I had a really striking experience once  when a group from Afghanistan came to visit me  and we had a really interesting conversation. TD  So we ended up talking about the Bamiyan Buddhas  which  as you know  were destroyed some years ago in Afghanistan. But the basis of our conversation was the different approach to spirituality on the part of the Muslim and Buddhist traditions. Of course  in Muslim  because of the teachings around the concept of idolatry  you don't find as many physical representations of divinity or of spiritual liberation as you do in the Buddhist tradition  where  of course  there are many statues of the Buddha that are highly revered. So  we were talking about the differences between the traditions and what many people perceived as the tragedy of the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas  but I offered the suggestion that perhaps we could look at this in a positive way. What we saw in the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas was the depletion of matter  some solid substance falling down and disintegrating. Maybe we could look at that to be more similar to the falling of the Berlin Wall  where a divide that had kept two types of people apart had collapsed and opened up a door for further communication. So I think that  in this way  it's always possible for us to derive something positive that can help us understand one another better. TD  So  with regard to the development that we've been talking about here at this conference  I really feel that the development that we make shouldn't create a further burden for us as human beings  but should be used to improve our fundamental lifestyle of how we live in the world. TD  Of course  I rejoice in the development and the growth and the rise of the noble land of India  the great country of India  but at the same time  I think  as some of us have acknowledged  we need to be aware that some aspects of this rise are coming at the cost of the very ground on which we stand. So  as we are climbing the tree  some of the things that we're doing in order to climb the tree are actually undermining the tree's very root. And so  what I think it comes down to is a question of  not only having information of what's going on  but paying attention to that and letting that shift our motivation to become more sincere and genuinely positive. We have hear  this week  about the horrible sufferings  for example  that so many women of the world are enduring day to day. We have that information  but what often happens to us is that we don't really choose to pay attention to it. We don't really choose to allow that to cause there to be a shift in our hearts. So I think the way forward for the world    one that will bring the path of outer development in harmony with the real root of happiness    is that we allow the information that we have to really make a change in our heart. TD  So I think that sincere motivation is very important for our future well being  or deep sense of well being as humans  and I think that means sinking in to whatever it is you're doing now. Whatever work you're trying to do now to benefit the world  sink into that  get a full taste of that. TD  So  since we've been here this week  we've taken millions of breaths  collectively  and perhaps we haven't witnessed any course changes happening in our lives  but we often miss the very subtle changes. And I think that sometimes we develop grand concepts of what happiness might look like for us  but that  if we pay attention  we can see that there are little symbols of happiness in every breath that we take. TD  So  every one of you who has come here is so talented  and you have so much to offer to the world  I think it would be a good note to conclude on then to just take a moment to appreciate how fortunate we are to have come together in this way and exchanged ideas and really form a strong aspiration and energy within ourselves that we will take the good that has come from this conference  the momentum  the positivity  and we will spread that and plant it in all of the corners of the world. His Holiness the Karmapa  Tomorrow is my Talk. TD  Lakshmi has worked incredibly hard  even in inviting me  let alone everything else that she has done to make this happen  and I was somewhat resistant at times  and I was also very nervous throughout this week. I was feeling under the weather and dizzy and so forth  and people would ask me  why. I would tell them   It's because I have to talk tomorrow.  And so Lakshmi had to put up with me through all of that  but I very much appreciate the opportunity she's given me to be here. And to you  everyone  thank you very much. HH  Thank you very much. Everyone  please think of your biggest personal goal. For real    you can take a second. You've got to feel this to learn it. Take a few seconds and think of your personal biggest goal  okay  Imagine deciding right now that you're going to do it. Imagine telling someone that you meet today what you're going to do. Imagine their congratulations  and their high image of you. Doesn't it feel good to say it out loud  Don't you feel one step closer already  like it's already becoming part of your identity  Well  bad news  you should have kept your mouth shut  because that good feeling now will make you less likely to do it. The repeated psychology tests have proven that telling someone your goal makes it less likely to happen. Any time you have a goal  there are some steps that need to be done  some work that needs to be done in order to achieve it. Ideally you would not be satisfied until you'd actually done the work. But when you tell someone your goal and they acknowledge it  psychologists have found that it's called a  social reality.  The mind is kind of tricked into feeling that it's already done. And then because you've felt that satisfaction  you're less motivated to do the actual hard work necessary. So this goes against conventional wisdom that we should tell our friends our goals  right  So they hold us to it. So  let's look at the proof.       Kurt Lewin  founder of social psychology  called this  substitution.        Wera Mahler found when it was acknowledged by others  it felt real in the mind.       Peter Gollwitzer wrote a whole book about this  and in       he did some new tests that were published. It goes like this      people across four separate tests. Everyone wrote down their personal goal. Then half of them announced their commitment to this goal to the room  and half didn't. Then everyone was given    minutes of work that would directly lead them towards their goal  but they were told that they could stop at any time. Now  those who kept their mouths shut worked the entire    minutes on average  and when asked afterward  said that they felt that they had a long way to go still to achieve their goal. But those who had announced it quit after only    minutes  on average  and when asked afterward  said that they felt much closer to achieving their goal. So if this is true  what can we do  Well  you could resist the temptation to announce your goal. You can delay the gratification that the social acknowledgment brings  and you can understand that your mind mistakes the talking for the doing. But if you do need to talk about something  you can state it in a way that gives you no satisfaction  such as   I really want to run this marathon  so I need to train five times a week and kick my ass if I don't  okay   So audience  next time you're tempted to tell someone your goal  what will you say  Exactly  Well done. This strange looking plant is called the Llareta. What looks like moss covering rocks is actually a shrub comprised of thousands of branches  each containing clusters of tiny green leaves at the end and so densely packed together that you could actually stand on top of it. This individual lives in the Atacama Desert in Chile  and it happens to be       years old. It also happens to be a relative of parsley. For the past five years  I've been researching  working with biologists and traveling all over the world to find continuously living organisms that are       years old and older. The project is part art and part science. There's an environmental component. And I'm also trying to create a means in which to step outside our quotidian experience of time and to start to consider a deeper timescale. I selected       years as my minimum age because I wanted to start at what we consider to be year zero and work backward from there. What you're looking at now is a tree called Jomon Sugi  living on the remote island of Yakushima. The tree was in part a catalyst for the project. I'd been traveling in Japan without an agenda other than to photograph  and then I heard about this tree that is       years old and knew that I had to go visit it. It wasn't until later  when I was actually back home in New York that I got the idea for the project. So it was the slow churn  if you will. I think it was my longstanding desire to bring together my interest in art  science and philosophy that allowed me to be ready when the proverbial light bulb went on. So I started researching  and to my surprise  this project had never been done before in the arts or the sciences. And    perhaps naively    I was surprised to find that there isn't even an area in the sciences that deals with this idea of global species longevity. So what you're looking at here is the rhizocarpon geographicum  or map lichen  and this is around       years old and lives in Greenland  which is a long way to go for some lichens. Visiting Greenland was more like traveling back in time than just traveling very far north. It was very primal and more remote than anything I'd ever experienced before. And this is heightened by a couple of particular experiences. One was when I had been dropped off by boat on a remote fjord  only to find that the archeologists I was supposed to meet were nowhere to be found. And it's not like you could send them a text or shoot them an e mail  so I was literally left to my own devices. But luckily  it worked out obviously  but it was a humbling experience to feel so disconnected. And then a few days later  we had the opportunity to go fishing in a glacial stream near our campsite  where the fish were so abundant that you could literally reach into the stream and grab out a foot long trout with your bare hands. It was like visiting a more innocent time on the planet. And then  of course  there's the lichens. These lichens grow only one centimeter every hundred years. I think that really puts human lifespans into a different perspective. And what you're looking at here is an aerial photo take over eastern Oregon. And if the title  Searching for Armillaria Death Rings   sounds ominous  it is. The Armillaria is actually a predatory fungus  killing certain species of trees in the forest. It's also more benignly known as the honey mushroom or the  humongous fungus  because it happens to be one of the world's largest organisms as well. So with the help of some biologists studying the fungus  I got some maps and some GPS coordinates and chartered a plane and started looking for the death rings  the circular patterns in which the fungus kills the trees. So I'm not sure if there are any in this photo  but I do know the fungus is down there. And then this back down on the ground and you can see that the fungus is actually invading this tree. So that white material that you see in between the bark and the wood is the mycelial felt of the fungus  and what it's doing    it's actually slowly strangling the tree to death by preventing the flow of water and nutrients. So this strategy has served it pretty well    it's       years old. And then from underground to underwater. This is a Brain Coral living in Tobago that's around       years old. And I had to overcome my fear of deep water to find this one. This is at about    feet or    meters  depth. And you'll see  there's some damage to the surface of the coral. That was actually caused by a school of parrot fish that had started eating it  though luckily  they lost interest before killing it. Luckily still  it seems to be out of harm's way of the recent oil spill. But that being said  we just as easily could have lost one of the oldest living things on the planet  and the full impact of that disaster is still yet to be seen. Now this is something that I think is one of the most quietly resilient things on the planet. This is clonal colony of Quaking Aspen trees  living in Utah  that is literally        years old. What looks like a forest is actually only one tree. Imagine that it's one giant root system and each tree is a stem coming up from that system. So what you have is one giant  interconnected  genetically identical individual that's been living for        years. It also happens to be male and  in theory immortal. This is a clonal tree as well. This is the spruce Gran Picea  which at       years is a mere babe in the woods. The location of this tree is actually kept secret for its own protection. I spoke to the biologist who discovered this tree  and he told me that that spindly growth you see there in the center is most likely a product of climate change. As it's gotten warmer on the top of the mountain  the vegetation zone is actually changing. So we don't even necessarily have to have direct contact with these organisms to have a very real impact on them. This is the Fortingall Yew    no  I'm just kidding    this is the Fortingall Yew. But I put that slide in there because I'm often asked if there are any animals in the project. And aside from coral  the answer is no. Does anybody know how old the oldest tortoise is    any guesses  Rachel Sussman       No      is the oldest living tortoise  so nowhere near      . And then  you might have heard of this giant clam that was discovered off the coast of northern Iceland that reached     years old. However  it died in the lab as they were determining its age. The most interesting discovery of late  I think is the so called immortal jellyfish  which has actually been observed in the lab to be able to be able to revert back to the polyp state after reaching full maturity. So that being said  it's highly unlikely that any jellyfish would survive that long in the wild. And back to the yew here. So as you can see  it's in a churchyard  it's in Scotland. It's behind a protective wall. And there are actually a number or ancient yews in churchyards around the U.K.  but if you do the math  you'll remember it's actually the yew trees that were there first  then the churches. And now down to another part of the world. I had the opportunity to travel around the Limpopo Province in South Africa with an expert in Baobab trees. And we saw a number of them  and this is most likely the oldest. It's around        and it's called the Sagole Baobab. And you know  I think of all of these organisms as palimpsests. They contain thousands of years of their own histories within themselves  and they also contain records of natural and human events. And the Baobabs in particular are a great example of this. You can see that this one has names carved into its trunk  but it also records some natural events. So the Baobabs  as they get older  tend to get pulpy in their centers and hollow out. And this can create great natural shelters for animals  but they've also been appropriated for some rather dubious human uses  including a bar  a prison and even a toilet inside of a tree. And this brings me to another favorite of mine    I think  because it is just so unusual. This plant is called the Welwitschia  and it lives only in parts of coastal Namibia and Angola  where it's uniquely adapted to collect moisture from mist coming off the sea. And what's more  it's actually a tree. It's a primitive conifer. You'll notice that it's bearing cones down the center. And what looks like two big heaps of leaves  is actually two single leaves that get shredded up by the harsh desert conditions over time. And it actually never sheds those leaves  so it also bears the distinction of having the longest leaves in the plant kingdom. I spoke to a biologist at the Kirstenbosch Botanical Garden in Capetown to ask him where he thought this remarkable plant came from  and his thought was that if you travel around Namibia  you see that there are a number of petrified forests  and the logs are all    the logs are all giant coniferous trees  and yet there's no sign of where they might have come from. So his thought was that flooding in the north of Africa actually brought those coniferous trees down tens of thousands of years ago  and what resulted was this remarkable adaptation to this unique desert environment. This is what I think is the most poetic of the oldest living things. This is something called an underground forest. So  I spoke to a botanist at the Pretoria Botanical Garden  who explained that certain species of trees have adapted to this region. It's bushfelt region  which is dry and prone to a lot of fires  as so what these trees have done is  if you can imagine that this is the crown of the tree  and that this is ground level  imagine that the whole thing  that whole bulk of the tree  migrated underground  and you just have those leaves peeping up above the surface. That way  when a fire roars through  it's the equivalent of getting your eyebrows singed. The tree can easily recover. These also tend to grow clonally  the oldest of which is        years old. Back in the U.S.  there's a couple plants of similar age. This is the clonal Creosote bush  which is around        years old. If you've been in the American West  you know the Creosote bush is pretty ubiquitous  but that being said  you see that this has this unique  circular form. And what's happening is it's expanding slowly outwards from that original shape. And it's one    again  that interconnected root system  making it one genetically identical individual. It also has a friend nearby    well  I think they're friends. This is the clonal Mojave yucca  it's about a mile away  and it's a little bit older than        years. And you see it has that similar circular form. And there's some younger clones dotting the landscape behind it. And both of these  the yucca and the Creosote bush  live on Bureau of Land Management land  and that's very different from being protected in a national park. In fact  this land is designated for recreational all terrain vehicle use. So  now I want to show what very well might be the oldest living thing on the planet. This is Siberian Actinobacteria  which is between         and         years old. This bacteria was discovered several years ago by a team of planetary biologists hoping to find clues to life on other planets by looking at one of the harshest conditions on ours. And what they found  by doing research into the permafrost  was this bacteria. But what's unique about it is that it's doing DNA repair below freezing. And what that means is that it's not dormant    it's actually been living and growing for half a million years. It's also probably one the most vulnerable of the oldest living things  because if the permafrost melts  it won't survive. This is a map that I've put together of the oldest living things  so you can get a sense of where they are  you see they're all over the world. The blue flags represent things that I've already photographed  and the reds are places that I'm still trying to get to. You'll see also  there's a flag on Antarctica. I'm trying to travel there to find       year old moss  which lives on the Antarctic Peninsula. So  I probably have about two more years left on this project    on this phase of the project  but after five years  I really feel like I know what's at the heart of this work. The oldest living things in the world are a record and celebration of our past  a call to action in the present and a barometer of our future. They've survived for millennia in desert  in the permafrost  at the tops of mountains and at the bottom of the ocean. They've withstood untold natural perils and human encroachments  but now some of them are in jeopardy  and they can't just get up and get out of the way. It's my hope that  by going to find these organisms  that I can help draw attention to their remarkable resilience and help play a part in insuring their continued longevity into the foreseeable future. Thank you. Well  that's kind of an obvious statement up there. I started with that sentence about    years ago  and I started in the context of developing countries  but you're sitting here from every corner of the world. So if you think of a map of your country  I think you'll realize that for every country on Earth  you could draw little circles to say   These are places where good teachers won't go.  On top of that  those are the places from where trouble comes. So we have an ironic problem    good teachers don't want to go to just those places where they're needed the most. I started in      to try and address this problem with an experiment  which was a very simple experiment in New Delhi. I basically embedded a computer into a wall of a slum in New Delhi. The children barely went to school  they didn't know any English    they'd never seen a computer before  and they didn't know what the internet was. I connected high speed internet to it    it's about three feet off the ground    turned it on and left it there. After this  we noticed a couple of interesting things  which you'll see. But I repeated this all over India and then through a large part of the world and noticed that children will learn to do what they want to learn to do. This is the first experiment that we did    eight year old boy on your right teaching his student  a six year old girl  and he was teaching her how to browse. This boy here in the middle of central India    this is in a Rajasthan village  where the children recorded their own music and then played it back to each other and in the process  they've enjoyed themselves thoroughly. They did all of this in four hours after seeing the computer for the first time. In another South Indian village  these boys here had assembled a video camera and were trying to take the photograph of a bumble bee. They downloaded it from Disney.com  or one of these websites     days after putting the computer in their village. So at the end of it  we concluded that groups of children can learn to use computers and the internet on their own  irrespective of who or where they were. At that point  I became a little more ambitious and decided to see what else could children do with a computer. We started off with an experiment in Hyderabad  India  where I gave a group of children    they spoke English with a very strong Telugu accent. I gave them a computer with a speech to text interface  which you now get free with Windows  and asked them to speak into it. So when they spoke into it  the computer typed out gibberish  so they said   Well  it doesn't understand anything of what we are saying.  So I said   Yeah  I'll leave it here for two months. Make yourself understood to the computer.  So the children said   How do we do that.  And I said   I don't know  actually.  And I left. Two months later    and this is now documented in the Information Technology for International Development journal    that accents had changed and were remarkably close to the neutral British accent in which I had trained the speech to text synthesizer. In other words  they were all speaking like James Tooley. So they could do that on their own. After that  I started to experiment with various other things that they might learn to do on their own. I got an interesting phone call once from Columbo  from the late Arthur C. Clarke  who said   I want to see what's going on.  And he couldn't travel  so I went over there. He said two interesting things   A teacher that can be replaced by a machine should be.  The second thing he said was that   If children have interest  then education happens.  And I was doing that in the field  so every time I would watch it and think of him. help people  because children quickly learn to navigate the web and find things which interest them. And when you've got interest  then you have education. Sugata Mitra  I took the experiment to South Africa. This is a    year old boy. like animals  and I listen to music. SM  And I asked him   Do you send emails   And he said   Yes  and they hop across the ocean.  This is in Cambodia  rural Cambodia    a fairly silly arithmetic game  which no child would play inside the classroom or at home. They would  you know  throw it back at you. They'd say   This is very boring.  If you leave it on the pavement and if all the adults go away  then they will show off with each other about what they can do. This is what these children are doing. They are trying to multiply  I think. And all over India  at the end of about two years  children were beginning to Google their homework. As a result  the teachers reported tremendous improvements in their English    rapid improvement and all sorts of things. They said   They have become really deep thinkers and so on and so forth. And indeed they had. I mean  if there's stuff on Google  why would you need to stuff it into your head  So at the end of the next four years  I decided that groups of children can navigate the internet to achieve educational objectives on their own. At that time  a large amount of money had come into Newcastle University to improve schooling in India. So Newcastle gave me a call. I said   I'll do it from Delhi.  They said   There's no way you're going to handle a million pounds worth of University money sitting in Delhi.  So in       I bought myself a heavy overcoat and moved to Newcastle. I wanted to test the limits of the system. The first experiment I did out of Newcastle was actually done in India. And I set myself and impossible target  can Tamil speaking    year old children in a South Indian village teach themselves biotechnology in English on their own  And I thought  I'll test them  they'll get a zero    I'll give the materials  I'll come back and test them    they get another zero  I'll go back and say   Yes  we need teachers for certain things.  I called in    children. They all came in there  and I told them that there's some really difficult stuff on this computer. I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't understand anything. It's all in English  and I'm going. So I left them with it. I came back after two months  and the    children marched in looking very  very quiet. I said   Well  did you look at any of the stuff   They said   Yes  we did.   Did you understand anything    No  nothing.  So I said   Well  how long did you practice on it before you decided you understood nothing   They said   We look at it every day.  So I said   For two months  you were looking at stuff you didn't understand   So a    year old girl raises her hand and says  literally   Apart from the fact that improper replication of the DNA molecule causes genetic disease  we've understood nothing else.  It took me three years to publish that. It's just been published in the British Journal of Educational Technology. One of the referees who refereed the paper said   It's too good to be true   which was not very nice. Well  one of the girls had taught herself to become the teacher. And then that's her over there. Remember  they don't study English. I edited out the last bit when I asked   Where is the neuron   and she says   The neuron  The neuron   and then she looked and did this. Whatever the expression  it was not very nice. So their scores had gone up from zero to    percent  which is an educational impossibility under the circumstances. But    percent is not a pass. So I found that they had a friend  a local accountant  a young girl  and they played football with her. I asked that girl   Would you teach them enough biotechnology to pass   And she said   How would I do that  I don't know the subject.  I said   No  use the method of the grandmother.  She said   What's that   I said   Well  what you've got to do is stand behind them and admire them all the time. Just say to them  'That's cool. That's fantastic. What is that  Can you do that again  Can you show me some more '  She did that for two months. The scores went up to     which is what the posh schools of New Delhi  with a trained biotechnology teacher were getting. So I came back to Newcastle with these results and decided that there was something happening here that definitely was getting very serious. So  having experimented in all sorts of remote places  I came to the most remote place that I could think of. Approximately       miles from Delhi is the little town of Gateshead. In Gateshead  I took    children and I started to fine tune the method. I made them into groups of four. I said   You make your own groups of four. Each group of four can use one computer and not four computers.  Remember  from the Hole in the Wall.  You can exchange groups. You can walk across to another group  if you don't like your group  etc. You can go to another group  peer over their shoulders  see what they're doing  come back to you own group and claim it as your own work.  And I explained to them that  you know  a lot of scientific research is done using that method. The children enthusiastically got after me and said   Now  what do you want us to do   I gave them six GCSE questions. The first group    the best one    solved everything in    minutes. The worst  in   . They used everything that they knew    news groups  Google  Wikipedia  Ask Jeeves  etc. The teachers said   Is this deep learning   I said   Well  let's try it. I'll come back after two months. We'll give them a paper test    no computers  no talking to each other  etc.  The average score when I'd done it with the computers and the groups was    percent. When I did the experiment  when I did the test  after two months  the score was    percent. There was photographic recall inside the children  I suspect because they're discussing with each other. A single child in front of a single computer will not do that. I have further results  which are almost unbelievable  of scores which go up with time. Because their teachers say that after the session is over  the children continue to Google further. Here in Britain  I put out a call for British grandmothers  after my Kuppam experiment. Well  you know  they're very vigorous people  British grandmothers.     of them volunteered immediately. The deal was that they would give me one hour of broadband time  sitting in their homes  one day in a week. So they did that  and over the last two years  over     hours of instruction has happened over Skype  using what my students call the granny cloud. The granny cloud sits over there. I can beam them to whichever school I want to. You say it. You can't catch me. Children  You can't catch me. Teacher  I'm the gingerbread man. Children  I'm the gingerbread man. Teacher  Well done. Very good ... SM  Back at Gateshead  a    year old girl gets into the heart of Hinduism in    minutes. You know  stuff which I don't know anything about. Two children watch a TEDTalk. They wanted to be footballers before. After watching eight TEDTalks  he wants to become Leonardo da Vinci. It's pretty simple stuff. This is what I'm building now    they're called SOLEs  Self Organized Learning Environments. The furniture is designed so that children can sit in front of big  powerful screens  big broadband connections  but in groups. If they want  they can call the granny cloud. This is a SOLE in Newcastle. The mediator is from Pune  India. So how far can we go  One last little bit and I'll stop. I went to Turin in May. I sent all the teachers away from my group of    year old students. I speak only English  they speak only Italian  so we had no way to communicate. I started writing English questions on the blackboard. The children looked at it and said   What   I said   Well  do it.  They typed it into Google  translated it into Italian  went back into Italian Google. Fifteen minutes later    next question  where is Calcutta  This one  they took only    minutes. I tried a really hard one then. Who was Pythagoras  and what did he do  There was silence for a while  then they said   You've spelled it wrong. It's Pitagora.  And then  in    minutes  the right angled triangles began to appear on the screens. This sent shivers up my spine. These are    year olds. Text  In another    minutes they would reach the Theory of Relativity. And then  SM  So you know what's happened  I think we've just stumbled across a self organizing system. A self organizing system is one where a structure appears without explicit intervention from the outside. Self organizing systems also always show emergence  which is that the system starts to do things  which it was never designed for. Which is why you react the way you do  because it looks impossible. I think I can make a guess now    education is self organizing system  where learning is an emergent phenomenon. It'll take a few years to prove it  experimentally  but I'm going to try. But in the meanwhile  there is a method available. One billion children  we need     million mediators    there are many more than that on the planet       million SOLEs      billion dollars and    years. We could change everything. Thanks. The moment I say  school   so many memories come back to me. It's like after every exam  when I walk out  the teacher would say   Hey  come. How did you do   I would say with a great smile   I will definitely pass.  And I didn't understand why  in one hand they say   Speak the truth   in the other hand  when you say the truth  they hated you. So it went on like that  and I didn't know where else to find myself. So I remember those nights I used to go to sleep with asking help from  the  Unknown because  for some reason  I couldn't believe what my father and mother hanged in the Puja room as a god  because my friend's family had something else as a god. So I thought   I guess I'll pray to  the  Unknown and ask help   and started getting help from everywhere  each and every corner of my life at that time. My brothers started giving me a few tips about drawing and painting. Then  when I was in eighth standard around    years old  I started working in a part time job in one of the signboard artists called Putu. And then school also started supporting me.  Oh  he's bad at studies  but let him send to the drawing competitions.  So it was good to survive with that little tool that I found to find my own place in school. And one of those competitions  I just won a small  little transistor Philips radio. And I didn't have the patience to wait until I reached home. So I just switched on in the train  loudly. If you travel in Indian trains  you can see people listening to radio and  you know  even from their mobiles. So at that time    and I was       and I was listening to just radio  and someone happened to sit next to me  like these three people are sitting here. You know  like just adjacent to me. He just started asking   Where did you buy the radio  How much is it   I said   It's a prize from  an  art competition.  And he said   Oh  I teach at a college of arts. I think you should study in a school of art. You just quit school and come there.  So  why I'm telling you this  you know  maybe  you know  whoever is sitting next to you can change your whole life    it's possible. It is that we need we need to be open and fine tuned. So that's what made me enter  the  college of arts after three attempts and just continue to inquire what I really want to do with art work  or art and finally I'm here in front of you. When I look back  you know  on what happened between that time and now here    the last       years    I can see that most of the works revolve around three subjects  but it was not intentional. And I just start out with a trace because I was thinking   What really makes us      you know  it's actually  the  past  what makes a person. So I was thinking  but when you look at the past  the way to understand the past is only by the traces available  because we cannot go back  to  the past. It can be ruins  or it can be music  or it can be painting or drawing or writing  whatever it is. But it is just a kind of trace of that time. And that fascinated me  to explore that territory. So I was working on the line  but instead of working about traces  I started capturing traces. So here are some of the works I would like to show you. So this is called  Self In Progress.  It's just a trace of being in this body. So here  what happened then  you know    what I really enjoyed the most is that this sculpture is nothing but a trace of myself. It's almost like a  D photograph. So there is an element of performance  and there is an element of sculpture  and there is an element of feeling one's self  so close to one's self. So it's almost like fossils for the future. And then moved slowly to explore the other possibilities of capturing traces. So this is what I was talking about  while molding  it's such a great experience  because we have freedom of like walking  or moving my hand or  moving around in the space  but the moment this becomes solid  when you cannot move even an inch  because this is plaster of Paris  so the moment you pour it it's like liquid  but after    minutes  it's almost like a hard stone. So this is capturing the trace of a thumbprint because  knowingly or unknowingly  whatever we do  you know  we leave our traces here. So I just thought   I'm going to capture thumbprint  footprint  or whatever traces we leave as humans.  This is the trace of fire  this is the trace of sun. Because when I was capturing traces  you know  this thought comes to me always  is it  only when the object touches the thing and it leaves the trace  or is there other ways to capture it   So this work is nothing but like    because of the focal length of the lens  it just shows what is on the other side. So I just put the paper on the focal length  which was an etching print  then I got the portrait of  the  sun from sunlight. This is called  Dawn to Dawn.  What I did here  I just put like    feet  of  paper then put a coconut rope  and just burnt it. So it took about    hours to get this line. So wherever the fire is eating the paper  that's what becomes the work    detail. Even though we have traces when we try to understand them  the perception and context play a major role to understand it. So do we really understand what it is  or are we trying to get what we think it is  Then move towards questioning the perception because  even though there are traces  when you try to understand them  you know you play a major role. So like let's say even a simple act. How many of you saw a cow crossing in India while you were coming from Bangalore to Mysore  Can you just raise the hand  If you just ask an opinion of how  everyone can interpret it. Like  let's say  if a schoolteacher says  she'll simply say   To get to the other side.  Why the cow was crossing the road  you know. The answer can be so different if Potter said it. He would say   For the greater good.  Martin Luther King would say   I imagine a world where all cows will be free to cross the road  without having their motives called into question.  Imagine Moses comes now  and he sees the same cow walking around the street. He would definitely say   God came down from heaven  and he said unto the cow  'Thou shalt cross the road.' And cow crossed the road  and there was much rejoicing as a holy cow.  Freud would say   The fact that you're at all concerned reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.  If we ask Einstein  he would say   Whether the cow crossed the road  or the road moved underneath the cow  depends on your frame of reference.  Or Buddha    if he saw the same cow  he would say   Asking this question denies your own nature  as a  cow.  So  what we see is just what we think often  and most of the time  we don't see what it is. It just all depends on one's perception. And context  what is really context  You know  I could just show you this little piece of paper. Because I always think meaning doesn't really exist. The meaning of what we create in this world doesn't exist. It's just created by the mind. If you look at this piece of paper  this is the breadth and this is called length. This is how we've been taught in school. But if you tear it in the middle    now  I didn't touch this breadth  but still  the meaning of this changes. So what we conceive as a meaning is always not there  it's on the other side  even when we say dark  light  good  bad  tall  short    all meaning it doesn't exist in reality. It's just that being a human  the way we train to perceive the reality creates this meaning. So this work from this period is mostly like    you know  this is a work called  Light Makes Dark.  It's just captured through from the lamp. So the lamp is not just giving a light  it's also giving a darkness. So this is a work of art  which is just trying to explore that. This is called  Limit Out.  This shows how limited our eye or hearing sense or touch    do we really see  This is an exact negative. It's about six inches deep in the wall  but it just appears like it's coming out of the wall. You know the wall is almost like    this is the first skin  and this is the second  and there's a third  and each creates a meaning. And we're just pulling the wall off the gallery. Again   Inward Out.  It's a full figure cast from myself. It's about eight inches deep. When I was doing that  I always wondered since I've worked with creators    and now you know  I've moved to questioning the perception    whenever I see the bird flying in the sky  it just makes me feel like  is there anything behind  are there any traces up there  which as a human  we don't see them  Is there any way to capture the thought into visual art  I couldn't find it. But a solution arrived after being quiet and not working for about six  seven months  in the restroom  when I was changing the air freshener that goes from solid substance to vapor. It's called Odonil. This is the work I made out of that material. The process to get to make the sculpture was interesting  because I wrote to Balsara  who produces that air freshener called Odonil  saying   Dear Sir  I am an artist. This is my catalogue. Will you help me to make this sculpture   They never wrote back to me. Then I thought   I will go to the Small Scale Industries Facilitating Unit and ask help.  So I told them   I'd like to start an air freshener company.  They said   Of course. This is the fee for the project report  and we will give you all the details   and they gave. Finally  I went back to them and said   It's not for starting the company  it's just to make my own work. Please come for the show.  And they did. And this work is in the Devi Art Foundation in Delhi. In India  nobody really talks about works of art  they always talk about the appreciation of art. You buy this for       rupees  it'll become        in two months. This is the craft that was going on  but there are a few collectors who also collect art which can depreciate. And this was collected by Anupam    which is like  finally in the end  he will not have anything  because it will evaporate. So this is after a few weeks  this is after a few months. It's just all about questioning the preconceptions. So if someone says   Oh  I see the portrait   it may not be the portrait after a few months. And if they say it's solid  it will not be solid  it will evaporate. And if they say they don't get it  that's also not true  because it's in the air. It's in the same gallery or in the same museum. So they inhaled it  but they are not aware of it. While I was doing that work  my mom and my dad  they were looking at it and they said   Why do you deal with negative subjects all the time   And I was like   What do you mean    Light makes dark and now evaporating self. Don't you think it remained something about death   they said.  Of course not. For me   I'm thinking   this is tucked in some small solid  but the moment it evaporates  it's merged with the whole.  But she said   No. Still  I don't like it. Can you make something from nothing as a sculptor   I said   No  mom. It can't be. Because we can create a sculpture by gathering dust together  or we can break the sculpture and get the dust  but there is nowhere that we can bring dust into the universe.  So  I did this work for her. It's called  Emerging Angel.  This is the first day    it just gives the appearance that one is becoming the other. So  the same sculpture after a few days. This is after       days. Through that small little slit between the glass box and the wood  the air goes underneath the sculpture and creates the other one. This gave me a greater faith. That evaporating sculpture gave me a greater faith that maybe there is many more possibilities to capture  the  invisible. So what you see now is called  Shadow Foreshadow.  And what I'd like to tell you is we don't see shadow  and we don't see light too  we see the source of the light. We see where it's bouncing  but we don't see  them  as they exist. You know  that's why the night sky  we see the sky as dark  but it's filled with light all the time. When it's bounced on the moon  we see it. The same thing in the darkroom. The little dust particle will again  reflect the light  and we realize the existence of light. So we don't see dark  we don't see light  we don't see gravity  we don't see electricity. So  I just started doing this work to inquire further about how to sculpt the space between this object and there. Because  as a visual artist  if I'm seeing this and I'm seeing that    but how to sculpt this  you know  If we sculpt this  this has two reference points. The skin of this is also representing this. And skin at the other end also represents the floor. I did this as an experiment of casting the shadow. So this is a corrugated box and its shadow. Then the second one    the moment you bring any invisible into the visible world it will have all the characteristics of the visible existence. So that produced a shadow. Then I thought  okay  let me sculpt that. Then  again  that becomes an object. Again  throwing light  then the third one. So what you see is nothing but shadow of a shadow of a shadow. And then again  at that point  there is no shadow. I thought   Oh  good. Work is finished.  You can see the detail. This is called  Gravity.  It's called  Breath.  It's just two holes on the gallery wall. It's a false wall  which contains like     cubic feet. So that hole actually makes the air come out and go in. So where it's happening  we can see  but what is happening will remain invisible only. This is from the show called  Invisible   at Talwar Gallery. This is called  Kaayam.  Detail. And what I'd like to tell you  our senses are so limited    we cannot hear everything  we cannot see everything. We don't feel   I am touching the air   but if the breeze is a little more faster  then I can feel it. So all of our construction of reality is through these limited senses. So my request was like  is there any way to use all this as just a symbol or a sign  And to really get to the point  we should move beyond  you know  go to the other side of the wall  like illogic  like are invisible. Because when we see someone walks  we see the footprint. But if we're just cutting that footprint from the whole thing and trying to analyze it  you will miss the point because the actual journey happens between those footprints  and the footprints are nothing but passing time. Thank you. My story is a little bit about war. It's about disillusionment. It's about death. And it's about rediscovering idealism in all of that wreckage. And perhaps also  there's a lesson about how to deal with our screwed up  fragmenting and dangerous world of the   st century. I don't believe in straightforward narratives. I don't believe in a life or history written as decision  A  led to consequence  B  led to consequence  C     these neat narratives that we're presented with  and that perhaps we encourage in each other. I believe in randomness  and one of the reasons I believe that is because me becoming a diplomat was random. I'm colorblind. I was born unable to see most colors. This is why I wear gray and black most of the time  and I have to take my wife with me to chose clothes. And I'd always wanted to be a fighter pilot when I was a boy. I loved watching planes barrel over our holiday home in the countryside. And it was my boyhood dream to be a fighter pilot. And I did the tests in the Royal Air Force to become a pilot  and sure enough  I failed. I couldn't see all the blinking different lights  and I can't distinguish color. So I had to choose another career  and this was in fact relatively easy for me  because I had an abiding passion all the way through my childhood  which was international relations. As a child  I read the newspaper thoroughly. I was fascinated by the Cold War  by the INF negotiations over intermediate range nuclear missiles  the proxy war between the Soviet Union and the U.S. in Angola or Afghanistan. These things really interested me. And so I decided quite at an early age I wanted to be a diplomat. And I  one day  I announced this to my parents    and my father denies this story to this day    I said   Daddy  I want to be a diplomat.  And he turned to me  and he said   Carne  you have to be very clever to be a diplomat.  And my ambition was sealed. In       I entered the British Foreign Service. That year        people applied to become a diplomat  and    of us succeeded. And as those numbers suggest  I was inducted into an elite and fascinating and exhilarating world. Being a diplomat  then and now  is an incredible job  and I loved every minute of it    I enjoyed the status of it. I bought myself a nice suit and wore leather soled shoes and reveled in this amazing access I had to world events. I traveled to the Gaza Strip. I headed the Middle East Peace Process section in the British Foreign Ministry. I became a speechwriter for the British Foreign Secretary. I met Yasser Arafat. I negotiated with Saddam's diplomats at the U.N. Later  I traveled to Kabul and served in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban. And I would travel in a C     transport and go and visit warlords in mountain hideaways and negotiate with them about how we were going to eradicate Al Qaeda from Afghanistan  surrounded by my Special Forces escort  who  themselves  had to have an escort of a platoon of Royal Marines  because it was so dangerous. And that was exciting    that was fun. It was really interesting. And it's a great cadre of people  incredibly close knit community of people. And the pinnacle of my career  as it turned out  was when I was posted to New York. I'd already served in Germany  Norway  various other places  but I was posted to New York to serve on the U.N. Security Council for the British delegation. And my responsibility was the Middle East  which was my specialty. And there  I dealt with things like the Middle East peace process  the Lockerbie issue    we can talk about that later  if you wish    but above all  my responsibility was Iraq and its weapons of mass destruction and the sanctions we placed on Iraq to oblige it to disarm itself of these weapons. I was the chief British negotiator on the subject  and I was steeped in the issue. And anyway  my tour    it was kind of a very exciting time. I mean it was very dramatic diplomacy. We went through several wars during my time in New York. I negotiated for my country the resolution in the Security Council of the   th of September      condemning the attacks of the day before  which were  of course  deeply present to us actually living in New York at the time. So it was kind of the best of time  worst of times kind of experience. I lived the high life. Although I worked very long hours  I lived in a penthouse in Union Square. I was a single British diplomat in New York City  you can imagine what that might have meant. I had a good time. But in       when my tour came to an end  I decided I wasn't going to go back to the job that was waiting for me in London. I decided to take a sabbatical  in fact  at the New School  Bruce. In some inchoate  inarticulate way I realized that there was something wrong with my work  with me. I was exhausted  and I was also disillusioned in a way I couldn't quite put my finger on. And I decided to take some time out from work. The Foreign Office was very generous. You could take these special unpaid leave  as they called them  and yet remain part of the diplomatic service  but not actually do any work. It was nice. And eventually  I decided to take a secondment to join the U.N. in Kosovo  which was then under U.N. administration. And two things happened in Kosovo  which kind of  again  shows the randomness of life  because these things turned out to be two of the pivots of my life and helped to deliver me to the next stage. But they were random things. One was that  in the summer of       the British government  somewhat reluctantly  decided to have an official inquiry into the use of intelligence on WMD in the run up to the Iraq War  a very limited subject. And I testified to that inquiry in secret. I had been steeped in the intelligence on Iraq and its WMD  and my testimony to the inquiry said three things  that the government exaggerated the intelligence  which was very clear in all the years I'd read it. And indeed  our own internal assessment was very clear that Iraq's WMD did not pose a threat to its neighbors  let alone to us. Secondly  the government had ignored all available alternatives to war  which in some ways was a more discreditable thing still. The third reason  I won't go into. But anyway  I gave that testimony  and that presented me with a crisis. What was I going to do  This testimony was deeply critical of my colleagues  of my ministers  who had  in my view had perpetrated a war on a falsehood. And so I was in crisis. And this wasn't a pretty thing. I moaned about it  I hesitated  I went on and on and on to my long suffering wife  and eventually I decided to resign from the British Foreign Service. I felt    there's a scene in the Al Pacino movie  The Insider   which you may know  where he goes back to CBS after they've let him down over the tobacco guy  and he goes   You know  I just can't do this anymore. Something's broken.  And it was like that for me. I love that movie. I felt just something's broken. I can't actually sit with my foreign minister or my prime minister again with a smile on my face and do what I used to do gladly for them. So took a running leap and jumped over the edge of a cliff. And it was a very  very uncomfortable  unpleasant feeling. And I started to fall. And today  that fall hasn't stopped  I'm still falling. But  in a way  I've got used to the sensation of it. And in a way  I kind of like the sensation of it a lot better than I like actually standing on top of the cliff  wondering what to do. A second thing happened in Kosovo  which kind of    I need a quick gulp of water  forgive me. A second thing happened in Kosovo  which kind of delivered the answer  which I couldn't really answer  which is   What do I do with my life   I love diplomacy    I have no career    I expected my entire life to be a diplomat  to be serving my country. I wanted to be an ambassador  and my mentors  my heroes  people who got to the top of my profession  and here I was throwing it all away. A lot of my friends were still in it. My pension was in it. And I gave it up. And what was I going to do  And that year  in Kosovo  this terrible  terrible thing happened  which I saw. In March       there were terrible riots all over the province    as it then was    of Kosovo.    people were killed. It was anarchy. And it's a very horrible thing to see anarchy  to know that the police and the military    there were lots of military troops there    actually can't stop that rampaging mob who's coming down the street. And the only way that rampaging mob coming down the street will stop is when they decide to stop and when they've had enough burning and killing. And that is not a very nice feeling to see  and I saw it. And I went through it. I went through those mobs. And with my Albanian friends  we tried to stop it  but we failed. And that riot taught me something  which isn't immediately obvious and it's kind of a complicated story. But one of the reasons that riot took place    those riots  which went on for several days  took place    was because the Kosovo people were disenfranchised from their own future. There were diplomatic negotiations about the future of Kosovo going on then  and the Kosovo government  let alone the Kosovo people  were not actually participating in those talks. There was this whole fancy diplomatic system  this negotiation process about the future of Kosovo  and the Kosovars weren't part of it. And funnily enough  they were frustrated about that. Those riots were part of the manifestation of that frustration. It wasn't the only reason  and life is not simple  one reason narratives. It was a complicated thing  and I'm not pretending it was more simple than it was. But that was one of the reasons. And that kind of gave me the inspiration    or rather to be precise  it gave my wife the inspiration. She said   Why don't you advise the Kosovars  Why don't you advise their government on their diplomacy   And the Kosovars were not allowed a diplomatic service. They were not allowed diplomats. They were not allowed a foreign office to help them deal with this immensely complicated process  which became known as the Final Status Process of Kosovo. And so that was the idea. That was the origin of the thing that became Independent Diplomat  the world's first diplomatic advisory group and a non profit to boot. And it began when I flew back from London after my time at the U.N. in Kosovo. I flew back and had dinner with the Kosovo prime minister and said to him   Look  I'm proposing that I come and advise you on the diplomacy. I know this stuff. It's what I do. Why don't I come and help you   And he raised his glass of raki to me and said   Yes  Carne. Come.  And I came to Kosovo and advised the Kosovo government. Independent Diplomat ended up advising three successive Kosovo prime ministers and the multi party negotiation team of Kosovo. And Kosovo became independent. Independent Diplomat is now established in five diplomatic centers around the world  and we're advising seven or eight different countries  or political groups  depending on how you wish to define them    and I'm not big on definitions. We're advising the Northern Cypriots on how to reunify their island. We're advising the Burmese opposition  the government of Southern Sudan  which    you heard it here first    is going to be a new country within the next few years. We're advising the Polisario Front of the Western Sahara  who are fighting to get their country back from Moroccan occupation after    years of dispossession. We're advising various island states in the climate change negotiations  which is suppose to culminate in Copenhagen. There's a bit of randomness here too because  when I was beginning Independent Diplomat  I went to a party in the House of Lords  which is a ridiculous place  but I was holding my drink like this  and I bumped into this guy who was standing behind me. And we started talking  and he said    I told him what I was doing  and I told him rather grandly I was going to establish Independent Diplomat in New York. At that time there was just me    and me and my wife were moving back to New York. And he said   Why don't you see my colleagues in New York   And it turned out he worked for an innovation company called  What If   which some of you have probably heard of. And one thing led to another  and I ended up having a desk in  What If  in New York  when I started Independent Diplomat. And watching  What If  develop new flavors of chewing gum for Wrigley or new flavors for Coke actually helped me innovate new strategies for the Kosovars and for the Saharawis of the Western Sahara. And I began to realize that there are different ways of doing diplomacy    that diplomacy  like business  is a business of solving problems  and yet the word innovation doesn't exist in diplomacy  it's all zero sum games and realpolitik and ancient institutions that have been there for generations and do things the same way they've always done things. And Independent Diplomat  today  tries to incorporate some of the things I learned at  What If . We all sit in one office and shout at each other across the office. We all work on little laptops and try to move desks to change the way we think. And we use naive experts who may know nothing about the countries we're dealing with  but may know something about something else to try to inject new thinking into the problems that we try to address for our clients. It's not easy  because our clients  by definition  are having a difficult time  diplomatically. There are  I don't know  some lessons from all of this  personal and political    and in a way  they're the same thing. The personal one is falling off a cliff is actually a good thing  and I recommend it. And it's a good thing to do at least once in your life just to tear everything up and jump. The second thing is a bigger lesson about the world today. Independent Diplomat is part of a trend which is emerging and evident across the world  which is that the world is fragmenting. States mean less than they used to  and the power of the state is declining. That means the power of others things is rising. Those other things are called non state actors. They may be corporations  they may be mafiosi  they may be nice NGOs  they may anything  any number of things. We are living in a more complicated and fragmented world. If governments are less able to affect the problems that affect us in the world  then that means  who is left to deal with them  who has to take greater responsibility to deal with them  Us. If they can't do it  who's left to deal with it  We have no choice but to embrace that reality. What this means is it's no longer good enough to say that international relations  or global affairs  or chaos in Somalia  or what's going on in Burma is none of your business  and that you can leave it to governments to get on with. I can connect any one of you by six degrees of separation to the Al Shabaab militia in Somalia. Ask me how later  particularly if you eat fish  interestingly enough  but that connection is there. We are all intimately connected. And this isn't just Tom Friedman  it's actually provable in case after case after case. What that means is  instead of asking your politicians to do things  you have to look to yourself to do things. And Independent Diplomat is a kind of example of this in a sort of loose way. There aren't neat examples  but one example is this  the way the world is changing is embodied in what's going on at the place I used to work    the U.N. Security Council. The U.N. was established in     . Its charter is basically designed to stop conflicts between states    interstate conflict. Today     percent of the agenda of the U.N. Security Council is about conflicts within states  involving non state parties    guerillas  separatists  terrorists  if you want to call them that  people who are not normal governments  who are not normal states. That is the state of the world today. When I realized this  and when I look back on my time at the Security Council and what happened with the Kosovars  and I realize that often the people who were most directly affected by what we were doing in the Security Council weren't actually there  weren't actually invited to give their views to the Security Council  I thought  this is wrong. Something's got to be done about this. So I started off in a traditional mode. Me and my colleagues at Independent Diplomat went around the U.N. Security Council. We went around    U.N. member states    the Kazaks  the Ethiopians  the Israelis    you name them  we went to see them    the secretary general  all of them  and said   This is all wrong. This is terrible that you don't consult these people who are actually affected. You've got to institutionalize a system where you actually invite the Kosovars to come and tell you what they think. This will allow you to tell me    you can tell them what you think. It'll be great. You can have an exchange. You can actually incorporate these people's views into your decisions  which means your decisions will be more effective and durable.  Super logical  you would think. I mean  incredibly logical. So obvious  anybody could get it. And of course  everybody got it. Everybody went   Yes  of course  you're absolutely right. Come back to us in maybe six months.  And of course  nothing happened    nobody did anything. The Security Council does its business in exactly the same way today that it did X number of years ago  when I was there    years ago. So we looked at that observation of basically failure and thought  what can we do about it. And I thought  I'm buggered if I'm going to spend the rest of my life lobbying for these crummy governments to do what needs to be done. So what we're going to do is we're actually going to set up these meetings ourselves. So now  Independent Diplomat is in the process of setting up meetings between the U.N. Security Council and the parties to the disputes that are on the agenda of the Security Council. So we will be bringing Darfuri rebel groups  the Northern Cypriots and the Southern Cypriots  rebels from Aceh  and awful long laundry list of chaotic conflicts around the world. And we will be trying to bring the parties to New York to sit down in a quiet room in a private setting with no press and actually explain what they want to the members of the U. N. Security Council  and for the members of the U.N. Security Council to explain to them what they want. So there's actually a conversation  which has never before happened. And of course  describing all this  any of you who know politics will think this is incredibly difficult  and I entirely agree with you. The chances of failure are very high  but it certainly won't happen if we don't try to make it happen. And my politics has changed fundamentally from when I was a diplomat to what I am today  and I think that outputs is what matters  not process  not technology  frankly  so much either. Preach technology to all the Twittering members of all the Iranian demonstrations who are now in political prison in Tehran  where Ahmadinejad remains in power. Technology has not delivered political change in Iran. You've got to look at the outputs  and you got to say to yourself   What can I do to produce that particular output   That is the politics of the   st century  and in a way  Independent Diplomat embodies that fragmentation  that change  that is happening to all of us. That's my story. Thanks. I am a cultural omnivore  one whose daily commute is made possible by attachment to an iPod    an iPod that contains Wagner and Mozart  pop diva Christina Aguilera  country singer Josh Turner  gangsta rap artist Kirk Franklin  concerti  symphonies and more and more. I'm a voracious reader  a reader who deals with Ian McEwan down to Stephanie Meyer. I have read the  Twilight  tetralogy. And one who lives for my home theater  a home theater where I devour DVDs  video on demand and a lot of television. For me   Law and Order  SVU   Tine Fey and     Rock  and  Judge Judy      The people are real  the cases are real  the rulings are final.  Now  I'm convinced a lot of you probably share my passions  especially my passion for Judge Judy  and you'd fight anybody who attempted to take her away from us  but I'm a little less convinced that you share the central passion of my life  a passion for the live professional performing arts  performing arts that represent the orchestral repertoire  yes  but jazz as well  modern dance  opera  theater and more and more and more. You know  frankly it's a sector that many of us who work in the field worry is being endangered and possibly dismantled by technology. While we initially heralded the Internet as the fantastic new marketing device that was going to solve all our problems  we now realize that the Internet is  if anything  too effective in that regard. Depending on who you read  an arts organization or an artist  who tries to attract the attention of a potential single ticket buyer  now competes with between three and       different marketing messages a typical citizen sees every single day. We now know in fact that technology is our biggest competitor for leisure time. Five years ago  Gen X'ers spent   .  hours online and TV  the majority on TV. Gen Y'ers spent even more      .  hours  the majority online. And now  a typical university entering student arrives at college already having spent        hours online and an additional        hours playing video games    a stark reminder that we operate in a cultural context where video games now outsell music and movie recordings combined. Moreover  we're afraid that technology has altered our very assumptions of cultural consumption. Thanks to the Internet  we believe we can get anything we want whenever we want it  delivered to our own doorstep. We can shop at three in the morning or eight at night  ordering jeans tailor made for our unique body types. Expectations of personalization and customization that the live performing arts    which have set curtain times  set venues  attendant inconveniences of travel  parking and the like    simply cannot meet. And we're all acutely aware  what's it going to mean in the future when we ask someone to pay a hundred dollars for a symphony  opera or ballet ticket  when that cultural consumer is used to downloading on the internet    hours a day for    cents a song or for free  These are enormous questions for those of us who work in this terrain. But as particular as they feel to us  we know we're not alone. All of us are engaged in a seismic  fundamental realignment of culture and communications  a realignment that is shaking and decimating the newspaper industry  the magazine industry  the book and publishing industry and more. Saddled in the performing arts as we are  by antiquated union agreements that inhibit and often prohibit mechanical reproduction and streaming  locked into large facilities that were designed to ossify the ideal relationship between artist and audience most appropriate to the   th century and locked into a business model dependent on high ticket revenues  where we charge exorbitant prices. Many of us shudder in the wake of the collapse of Tower Records and ask ourselves   Are we next   Everyone I talk to in performing arts resonates to the words of Adrienne Rich  who  in  Dreams of a Common Language   wrote   We are out in a country that has no language  no laws. Whatever we do together is pure invention. The maps they gave us are out of date by years.  And for those of you who love the arts  aren't you glad you invited me here to brighten your day  Now  rather than saying that we're on the brink of our own annihilation  I prefer to believe that we are engaged in a fundamental reformation  a reformation like the religious Reformation of the   th century. The arts reformation  like the religious Reformation  is spurred in part by technology  with indeed  the printing press really leading the charge on the religious Reformation. Both reformations were predicated on fractious discussion  internal self doubt and massive realignment of antiquated business models. And at heart  both reformations  I think were asking the questions  who's entitled to practice  How are they entitled to practice  And indeed  do we need anyone to intermediate for us in order to have an experience with a spiritual divine  Chris Anderson  someone I trust you all know  editor in chief of Wired magazine and author of  The Long Tail   really was the first    for me    to nail a lot of this. He wrote a long time ago  you know  thanks to the invention of the Internet  web technology  mini cams and more  the means of artistic production have been democratized for the first time in all of human history. In the     s  if any of you wanted to make a movie  you had to work for Warner Brothers or RKO because who could afford a movie set and lighting equipment and editing equipment and scoring and more  And now who in this room doesn't know a    year old hard at work on her second  third  or fourth movie  Similarly  the means of artistic distribution have been democratized for the first time in human history. Again  in the '  s  Warner Brothers  RKO did that for you. Now  go to YouTube  Facebook  you have worldwide distribution without leaving the privacy of your own bedroom. This double impact is occasioning a massive redefinition of the cultural market  a time when anyone is a potential author. Frankly  what we're seeing now in this environment is a massive time  when the entire world is changing as we move from a time when audience numbers are plummeting. But the number of arts participants  people who write poetry  who sing songs  who perform in church choirs  is exploding beyond our wildest imaginations. This group  others have called the  pro ams   amateur artists doing work at a professional level. You see them on YouTube  in dance competitions  film festivals and more. They are radically expanding our notions of the potential of an aesthetic vocabulary  while they are challenging and undermining the cultural autonomy of our traditional institutions. Ultimately  we now live in a world defined not by consumption  but by participation. But I want to be clear  just as the religious Reformation did not spell the end to the formal Church or to the priesthood  I believe that our artistic institutions will continue to have importance. They currently are the best opportunities for artists to have lives of economic dignity    not opulence    of dignity. And they are the places where artists who deserve and want to work at a certain scale of resources will find a home. But to view them as synonymous with the entirety of the arts community is  by far  too short sighted. And indeed  while we've tended to polarize the amateur from the professional  the single most exciting development in the last five to    years has been the rise of the professional hybrid artist  the professional artist who works  not primarily in the concert hall or on the stage  but most frequently around women's rights  or human rights  or on global warming issues or AIDS relief for more    not out of economic necessity  but out of a deep  organic conviction that the work that she or he  is called to do cannot be accomplished in the traditional hermetic arts environment. Today's dance world is not defined solely by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet or the National Ballet of Canada  but by Liz Lerman's Dance Exchange    a multi generational  professional dance company  whose dancers range in age from    to     and who work with genomic scientists to embody the DNA strand and with nuclear physicists at CERN. Today's professional theater community is defined  not only the Shaw and Stratford Festivals  but by the Cornerstone Theater of Los Angeles    a collective of artists that after       brought together    different religious communities    the Bahia  the Catholic  the Muslim  the Jewish  even the Native American and the gay and lesbian communities of faith  helping them create their own individual plays and one massive play  where they explored the differences in their faith and found commonality as an important first step toward cross community healing. Today's performers  like Rhodessa Jones  work in women's prisons  helping women prisoners articulate the pain of incarceration  while today's playwrights and directors work with youth gangs to find alternate channels to violence and more and more and more. And indeed  I think  rather than being annihilated  the performing arts are posed on the brink of a time when we will be more important than we have ever been. You know  we've said for a long time  we are critical to the health of the economic communities in your town. And absolutely    I hope you know that every dollar spent on a performing arts ticket in a community generates five to seven additional dollars for the local economy  dollars spent in restaurants or on parking  at the fabric stores where we buy fabric for costumes  the piano tuner who tunes the instruments and more. But the arts are going to be more important to economies as we go forward  especially in industries we can't even imagine yet  just as they have been central to the iPod and the computer game industries  which few  if any of us come have foreseen    to    years ago. Business leadership will depend more and more on emotional intelligence  the ability to listen deeply  to have empathy  to articulate change  to motivate others    the very capacities that the arts cultivate with every encounter. Especially now  as we all must confront the fallacy of a market only orientation  uninformed by social conscience  we must seize and celebrate the power of the arts to shape our individual and national characters  and especially characters of the young people  who all too often  are subjected to bombardment of sensation  rather than digested experience. Ultimately  especially now in this world  where we live in a context of regressive and onerous immigration laws  in reality TV that thrives on humiliation  and in a context of analysis  where the thing we hear most repeatedly  day in  day out in the United States  in every train station  every bus station  every plane station is   Ladies and gentlemen  please report any suspicious behavior or suspicious individuals to the authorities nearest you   when all of these ways we are encouraged to view our fellow human being with hostility and fear and contempt and suspicion. The arts  whatever they do  whenever they call us together  invite us to look at our fellow human being with generosity and curiosity. God knows  if we ever needed that capacity in human history  we need it now. You know  we're bound together  not  I think by technology  entertainment and design  but by common cause. We work to promote healthy vibrant societies  to ameliorate human suffering  to promote a more thoughtful  substantive  empathic world order. I salute all of you as activists in that quest and urge you to embrace and hold dear the arts in your work  whatever your purpose may be. I promise you the hand of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation is stretched out in friendship for now and years to come. And I thank you for your kindness and your patience in listening to me this afternoon. Thank you  and godspeed. If you really want to understand the problem that we're facing with the oceans  you have to think about the biology at the same time you think about the physics. We can't solve the problems unless we start studying the ocean in a very much more interdisciplinary way. So I'm going to demonstrate that through discussion of some of the climate change things that are going on in the ocean. We'll look at sea level rise. We'll look at ocean warming. And then the last thing on the list there  ocean acidification    if you were to ask me  you know   What do you worry about the most  What frightens you   for me  it's ocean acidification. And this has come onto the stage pretty recently. So I will spend a little time at the end. I was in Copenhagen in December like a number of you in this room. And I think we all found it  simultaneously  an eye opening and a very frustrating experience. I sat in this large negotiation hall  at one point  for three or four hours  without hearing the word  oceans  one time. It really wasn't on the radar screen. The nations that brought it up when we had the speeches of the national leaders    it tended to be the leaders of the small island states  the low lying island states. And by this weird quirk of alphabetical order of the nations  a lot of the low lying states  like Kiribati and Nauru  they were seated at the very end of these immensely long rows. You know  they were marginalized in the negotiation room. One of the problems is coming up with the right target. It's not clear what the target should be. And how can you figure out how to fix something if you don't have a clear target  Now  you've heard about  two degrees   that we should limit temperature rise to no more than two degrees. But there's not a lot of science behind that number. We've also talked about concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Should it be      Should it be      There's not a lot of science behind that one either. Most of the science that is behind these numbers  these potential targets  is based on studies on land. And I would say  for the people that work in the ocean and think about what the targets should be  we would argue that they must be much lower. You know  from an oceanic perspective      is way too high. Now there's compelling evidence that it really needs to be    . We are  right now  at     parts per million of CO  in the atmosphere. We're not going to put the brakes on in time to stop at      so we've got to accept we're going to do an overshoot  and the discussion as we go forward has to focus on how far the overshoot goes and what's the pathway back to    . Now  why is this so complicated  Why don't we know some of these things a little bit better  Well  the problem is that we've got very complicated forces in the climate system. There's all kinds of natural causes of climate change. There's air sea interactions. Here in Galapagos  we're affected by El Ninos and La Nina. But the entire planet warms up when there's a big El Nino. Volcanoes eject aerosols into the atmosphere. That changes our climate. The ocean contains most of the exchangeable heat on the planet. So anything that influences how ocean surface waters mix with the deep water changes the ocean of the planet. And we know the solar output's not constant through time. So those are all natural causes of climate change. And then we have the human induced causes of climate change as well. We're changing the characteristics of the surface of the land  the reflectivity. We inject our own aerosols into the atmosphere  and we have trace gases  and not just carbon dioxide    it's methane  ozone  oxides of sulfur and nitrogen. So here's the thing. It sounds like a simple question. Is CO  produced by man's activities causing the planet to warm up  But to answer that question  to make a clear attribution to carbon dioxide  you have to know something about all of these other agents of change. But the fact is we do know a lot about all of those things. You know  thousands of scientists have been working on understanding all of these man made causes and the natural causes. And we've got it worked out  and we can say   Yes  CO  is causing the planet to warm up now.  Now  we have many ways to study natural variability. I'll show you a few examples of this now. This is the ship that I spent the last three months on in the Antarctic. It's a scientific drilling vessel. We go out for months at a time and drill into the sea bed to recover sediments that tell us stories of climate change  right. Like one of the ways to understand our greenhouse future is to drill down in time to the last period where we had CO  double what it is today. And so that's what we've done with this ship. This was    this is south of the Antarctic Circle. It looks downright tropical there. One day where we had calm seas and sun  which was the reason I could get off the ship. Most of the time it looked like this. We had a waves up to    ft. and winds averaging about    knots for most of the voyage and up to    or    knots. So that trip just ended  and I can't show you too many results from that right now  but we'll go back one more year  to another drilling expedition I've been involved in. This was led by Ross Powell and Tim Naish. It's the ANDRILL project. And we made the very first bore hole through the largest floating ice shelf on the planet. This is a crazy thing  this big drill rig wrapped in a blanket to keep everybody warm  drilling at temperatures of minus   . And we drilled in the Ross Sea. That's the Ross Sea Ice Shelf on the right there. So  this huge floating ice shelf the size of Alaska comes from West Antarctica. Now  West Antarctica is the part of the continent where the ice is grounded on sea floor as much as       meters deep. So that ice sheet is partly floating  and it's exposed to the ocean  to the ocean heat. This is the part of Antarctica that we worry about. Because it's partly floating  you can imagine  is sea level rises a little bit  the ice lifts off the bed  and then it can break off and float north. When that ice melts  sea level rises by six meters. So we drill back in time to see how often that's happened  and exactly how fast that ice can melt. Here's the cartoon on the left there. We drilled through a hundred meters of floating ice shelf then through     meters of water and then       meters into the sea floor. So it's the deepest geological bore hole ever drilled. It took about    years to put this project together. And here's what we found. Now  there's    scientists working on this project  and people are doing all kinds of really complicated and expensive analyses. But it turns out  you know  the thing that told the best story was this simple visual description. You know  we saw this in the core samples as they came up. We saw these alternations between sediments that look like this    there's gravel and cobbles in there and a bunch of sand. That's the kind of material in the deep sea. It can only get there if it's carried out by ice. So we know there's an ice shelf overhead. And that alternates with a sediment that looks like this. This is absolutely beautiful stuff. This sediment is     percent made up of the shells of microscopic plants. And these plants need sunlight  so we know when we find that sediment there's no ice overhead. And we saw about    alternations between open water and ice covered water  between gravels and these plant sediments. So what that means is  what it tells us is that the Ross Sea region  this ice shelf  melted back and formed anew about    times. And this is in the past four million years. This was completely unexpected. Nobody imagined that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet was this dynamic. In fact  the lore for many years has been   The ice formed many tens of millions of years ago  and it's been there ever since.  And now we know that in our recent past it melted back and formed again  and sea level went up and down  six meters at a time. What caused it  Well  we're pretty sure that it's very small changes in the amount of sunlight reaching Antarctica  just caused by natural changes in the orbit of the Earth. But here's the key thing  you know  the other thing we found out is that the ice sheet passed a threshold  that the planet warmed up enough    and the number's about one degree to one and a half degrees Centigrade    the planet warmed up enough that it became ... that ice sheet became very dynamic and was very easily melted. And you know what  We've actually changed the temperature in the last century just the right amount. So many of us are convinced now that West Antarctica  the West Antarctic Ice Sheet  is starting to melt. We do expect to see a sea level rise on the order of one to two meters by the end of this century. And it could be larger than that. This is a serious consequence for nations like Kiribati  you know  where the average elevation is about a little over a meter above sea level. Okay  the second story takes place here in Galapagos. This is a bleached coral  coral that died during the      '   El Nino. This is from Champion Island. It's about a meter tall Pavona clavus colony. And it's covered with algae. That's what happens. When these things die  immediately  organisms come in and encrust and live on that dead surface. And so  when a coral colony is killed by an El Nino event  it leaves this indelible record. You can go then and study corals and figure out how often do you see this. So one of the things thought of in the '  s was to go back and take cores of coral heads throughout the Galapagos and find out how often was there a devastating event. And just so you know       '    that El Nino killed    percent of all the corals here in Galapagos. Then there was similar mortality in '   '  . And what we found after drilling back in time two to     years was that these were unique events. We saw no other mass mortality events. So these events in our recent past really are unique. So they're either just truly monster El Ninos  or they're just very strong El Ninos that occurred against a backdrop of global warming. Either case  it's bad news for the corals of the Galapagos Islands. Here's how we sample the corals. This is actually Easter Island. Look at this monster. This coral is eight meters tall  right. And it been growing for about     years. Now  Sylvia Earle turned me on to this exact same coral. And she was diving here with John Lauret    I think it was         and collected a little nugget and sent it to me. And we started working on it  and we figured out we could tell the temperature of the ancient ocean from analyzing a coral like this. So we have a diamond drill. We're not killing the colony  we're taking a small core sample out of the top. The core comes up as these cylindrical tubes of limestone. And that material then we take back to the lab and analyze it. You can see some of the coral cores there on the right. So we've done that all over the Eastern Pacific. We're starting to do it in the Western Pacific as well. I'll take you back here to the Galapagos Islands. And we've been working at this fascinating uplift here in Urbina Bay. That the place where  during an earthquake in       this marine terrace was lifted up out of the ocean very quickly  and it was lifted up about six to seven meters. And so now you can walk through a coral reef without getting wet. If you go on the ground there  it looks like this  and this is the grandaddy coral. It's    meters in diameter  and we know that it started growing in the year     . Imagine that. And that coral was growing happily in those shallow waters  until       when the earthquake happened. Now the reason we know it's      is that these corals have growth bands. When you cut them  slice those cores in half and x ray them  you see these light and dark bands. Each one of those is a year. We know these corals grow about a centimeter and a half a year. And we just count on down to the bottom. Then their other attribute is that they have this great chemistry. We can analyze the carbonate that makes up the coral  and there's a whole bunch of things we can do. But in this case  we measured the different isotopes of oxygen. Their ratio tells us the water temperature. In this example here  we had monitored this reef in Galapagos with temperature recorders  so we know the temperature of the water the coral's growing in. Then after we harvest a coral  we measure this ratio  and now you can see  those curves match perfectly. In this case  at these islands  you know  corals are instrumental quality recorders of change in the water. And of course  our thermometers only take us back    years or so here. The coral can take us back hundreds and thousands of years. So  what we do  we've merged a lot of different data sets. It's not just my group  there's maybe    groups worldwide doing this. But we get these instrumental  and near instrumental quality records of temperature change that go back hundreds of years  and we put them together. Here's a synthetic diagram. There's a whole family of curves here. But what's happening  we're looking at the last thousand years of temperature on the planet. And there's five or six different compilations there  But each one of those compilations reflects input from hundreds of these kinds of records from corals. We do similar things with ice cores. We work with tree rings. And that's how we discover what is truly natural and how different is the last century  right  And I chose this one because it's complicated and messy looking  right. This is as messy as it gets. You can see there's some signals there. Some of the records show lower temperatures than others. Some of them show greater variability. But they all tell us what the natural variability is. Some of them are from the northern hemisphere  some are from the entire globe. But here's what we can say  what's natural in the last thousand years is that the planet was cooling down. It was cooling down until about      or so. And there is natural variability caused by the Sun  caused by El Ninos. A century scale  decadal scale variability  and we know the magnitude  it's about two tenths to four tenths of a degree Centigrade. But then at the very end is where we have the instrumental record in black. And there's the temperature up there in     . You know  we've warmed the globe about a degree Centigrade in the last century  and there's nothing in the natural part of that record that resembles what we've seen in the last century. You know  that's the strength of our argument  that we are doing something that's truly different. So I'll close with a short discussion of ocean acidification. I like it as a component of global change to talk about  because  even if you are a hard bitten global warming skeptic  and I talk to that community fairly often  you cannot deny the simple physics of CO  dissolving in the ocean. You know  we're pumping out lots of CO  into the atmosphere  from fossil fuels  from cement production. Right now  about a third of that carbon dioxide is dissolving straight into the sea  right  And as it does so  it makes the ocean more acidic. So  you cannot argue with that. That is what's happening right now  and it's a very different issue than the global warming issue. It has many consequences. There's consequences for carbonate organisms. There are many organisms that build their shells out of calcium carbonate    plants and animals both. The main framework material of coral reefs is calcium carbonate. That material is more soluble in acidic fluid. So one of the things we're seeing is organisms are having to spend more metabolic energy to build and maintain their shells. At some point  as this transience  as this CO  uptake in the ocean continues  that material's actually going to start to dissolve. And on coral reefs  where some of the main framework organisms disappear  we will see a major loss of marine biodiversity. But it's not just the carbonate producers that are affected. There's many physiological processes that are influenced by the acidity of the ocean. So many reactions involving enzymes and proteins are sensitive to the acid content of the ocean. So  all of these things    greater metabolic demands  reduced reproductive success  changes in respiration and metabolism. You know  these are things that we have good physiological reasons to expect to see stressed caused by this transience. So we figured out some pretty interesting ways to track CO  levels in the atmosphere  going back millions of years. We used to do it just with ice cores  but in this case  we're going back    million years. And we take samples of the sediment  and it tells us the CO  level of the ocean  and therefore the CO  level of the atmosphere. And here's the thing  you have to go back about    million years to find a time when CO  levels were about what they are today. You have to go back about    million years to find a time when CO  levels were double what they are today. Now  what that means is that all of the organisms that live in the sea have evolved in this chemostatted ocean  with CO  levels lower than they are today. That's the reason that they're not able to respond or adapt to this rapid acidification that's going on right now. So  Charlie Veron came up with this statement last year   The prospect of ocean acidification may well be the most serious of all of the predicted outcomes of anthropogenic CO  release.  And I think that may very well be true  so I'll close with this. You know  we do need the protected areas  absolutely  but for the sake of the oceans  we have to cap or limit CO  emissions as soon as possible. Thank you very much. If nothing else  at least I've discovered what it is we put our speakers through  sweaty palms  sleepless nights  a wholly unnatural fear of clocks. I mean  it's quite brutal. And I'm also a little nervous about this. There are nine billion humans coming our way. Now  the most optimistic dreams can get dented by the prospect of people plundering the planet. But recently  I've become intrigued by a different way of thinking of large human crowds  because there are circumstances where they can do something really cool. It's a phenomenon that I think any organization or individual can tap into. It certainly impacted the way we think about TED's future  and perhaps the world's future overall. So  let's explore. The story starts with just a single person  a child  behaving a little strangely. This kid is known online as Lil Demon. He's doing tricks here  dance tricks  that probably no six year old in history ever managed before. How did he learn them  And what drove him to spend the hundreds of hours of practice this must have taken  Here's a clue.   Step your game up. Oh. Oh.   Chris Anderson  So  that was sent to me by this man  a filmmaker  Jonathan Chu  who told me that was the moment he realized the Internet was causing dance to evolve. This is what he said at TED in February. In essence  dancers were challenging each other online to get better  incredible new dance skills were being invented  even the six year olds were joining in. It felt like a revolution. And so Jon had a brilliant idea  He went out to recruit the best of the best dancers off of YouTube to create this dance troupe    The League of Extraordinary Dancers  the LXD. I mean  these kids were web taught  but they were so good that they got to play at the Oscars this year. And at TED here in February  their passion and brilliance just took our breath away. So  this story of the evolution of dance seems strangely familiar. You know  a while after TEDTalks started taking off  we noticed that speakers were starting to spend a lot more time in preparation. It was resulting in incredible new talks like these two. ... Months of preparation crammed into    minutes  raising the bar cruelly for the next generation of speakers  with the effects that we've seen this week. It's not as if J.J. and Jill actually ended their talks saying   Step your game up   but they might as well have. So  in both of these cases  you've got these cycles of improvement  apparently driven by people watching web video. What is going on here  Well  I think it's the latest iteration of a phenomenon we can call  crowd accelerated innovation.  And there are just three things you need for this thing to kick into gear. You can think of them as three dials on a giant wheel. You turn up the dials  the wheel starts to turn. And the first thing you need is ... a crowd  a group of people who share a common interest. The bigger the crowd  the more potential innovators there are. That's important  but actually most people in the crowd occupy these other roles. They're creating the ecosystem from which innovation emerges. The second thing you need is light. You need clear  open visibility of what the best people in that crowd are capable of  because that is how you will learn how you will be empowered to participate. And third  you need desire. You know  innovation's hard work. It's based on hundreds of hours of research  of practice. Absent desire  not going to happen. Now  here's an example    pre Internet    of this machine in action. Dancers at a street corner    it's a crowd  a small one  but they can all obviously see what each other can do. And the desire part comes  I guess  from social status  right  Best dancer walks tall  gets the best date. There's probably going to be some innovation happening here. But on the web  all three dials are ratcheted right up. The dance community is now global. There's millions connected. And amazingly  you can still see what the best can do  because the crowd itself shines a light on them  either directly  through comments  ratings  email  Facebook  Twitter  or indirectly  through numbers of views  through links that point Google there. So  it's easy to find the good stuff  and when you've found it  you can watch it in close up repeatedly and read what hundreds of people have written about it. That's a lot of light. But the desire element is really dialed way up. I mean  you might just be a kid with a webcam  but if you can do something that goes viral  you get to be seen by the equivalent of sports stadiums crammed with people. You get hundreds of strangers writing excitedly about you. And even if it's not that eloquent    and it's not    it can still really make your day. So  this possibility of a new type of global recognition  I think  is driving huge amounts of effort. And it's important to note that it's not just the stars who are benefiting  because you can see the best  everyone can learn. Also  the system is self fueling. It's the crowd that shines the light and fuels the desire  but the light and desire are a lethal one two combination that attract new people to the crowd. So  this is a model that pretty much any organization could use to try and nurture its own cycle of crowd accelerated innovation. Invite the crowd  let in the light  dial up the desire. And the hardest part about that is probably the light  because it means you have to open up  you have to show your stuff to the world. It's by giving away what you think is your deepest secret that maybe millions of people are empowered to help improve it. And  very happily  there's one class of people who really can't make use of this tool. The dark side of the web is allergic to the light. I don't think we're going to see terrorists  for example  publishing their plans online and saying to the world   Please  could you help us to actually make them work this time   But you can publish your stuff online. And if you can get that wheel to turn  look out. So  at TED  we've become a little obsessed with this idea of openness. In fact  my colleague  June Cohen  has taken to calling it  radical openness   because it works for us each time. We opened up our talks to the world  and suddenly there are millions of people out there helping spread our speakers' ideas  and thereby making it easier for us to recruit and motivate the next generation of speakers. By opening up our translation program  thousands of heroic volunteers    some of them watching online right now  and thank you     have translated our talks into more than    languages  thereby tripling our viewership in non English speaking countries. By giving away our TEDx brand  we suddenly have a thousand plus live experiments in the art of spreading ideas. And these organizers  they're seeing each other  they're learning from each other. We are learning from them. We're getting great talks back from them. The wheel is turning. Okay  step back a minute. I mean  it's really not news for me to tell you that innovation emerges out of groups. You know  we've heard that this week    this romantic notion of the lone genius with the  eureka   moment that changes the world is misleading. Even he said that  and he would know. We're a social species. We spark off each other. It's also not news to say that the Internet has accelerated innovation. For the past    years  powerful communities have been connecting online  sparking off each other. If you take programmers  you know  the whole open source movement is a fantastic instance of crowd accelerated innovation. But what's key here is  the reason these groups have been able to connect is because their work output is of the type that can be easily shared digitally    a picture  a music file  software. And that's why what I'm excited about  and what I think is under reported  is the significance of the rise of online video. This is the technology that's going to allow the rest of the world's talents to be shared digitally  thereby launching a whole new cycle of crowd accelerated innovation. The first few years of the web were pretty much video free  for this reason  video files are huge  the web couldn't handle them. But in the last    years  bandwidth has exploded a hundredfold. Suddenly  here we are. Humanity watches    million hours of YouTube every day. Cisco actually estimates that  within four years  more than    percent of the web's data will be video. If it's all puppies  porn and piracy  we're doomed. I don't think it will be. Video is high bandwidth for a reason. It packs a huge amount of data  and our brains are uniquely wired to decode it. Here  let me introduce you to Sam Haber. He's a unicyclist. Before YouTube  there was no way for him to discover his sport's true potential  because you can't communicate this stuff in words  right  But looking at video clips posted by strangers  a world of possibility opens up for him. Suddenly  he starts to emulate and then to innovate. And a global community of unicyclists discover each other online  inspire each other to greatness. And there are thousands of other examples of this happening    of video driven evolution of skills  ranging from the physical to the artful. And I have to tell you  as a former publisher of hobbyist magazines  I find this strangely beautiful. I mean  there's a lot of passion right here on this screen. But if Rube Goldberg machines and video poetry aren't quite your cup of tea  how about this. Jove is a website that was founded to encourage scientists to publish their peer reviewed research on video. There's a problem with a traditional scientific paper. It can take months for a scientist in another lab to figure out how to replicate the experiments that are described in print. Here's one such frustrated scientist  Moshe Pritsker  the founder of Jove. He told me that the world is wasting billions of dollars on this. But look at this video. I mean  look  if you can show instead of just describing  that problem goes away. So it's not far fetched to say that  at some point  online video is going to dramatically accelerate scientific advance. Here's another example that's close to our hearts at TED  where video is sometimes more powerful than print    the sharing of an idea. Why do people like watching TEDTalks  All those ideas are already out there in print. It's actually faster to read than to view. Why would someone bother  Well  so  there's some showing as well as telling. But even leaving the screen out of it  there's still a lot more being transferred than just words. And in that non verbal portion  there's some serious magic. Somewhere hidden in the physical gestures  the vocal cadence  the facial expressions  the eye contact  the passion  the kind of awkward  British body language  the sense of how the audience are reacting  there are hundreds of subconscious clues that go to how well you will understand  and whether you're inspired    light  if you like  and desire. Incredibly  all of this can be communicated on just a few square inches of a screen. Reading and writing are actually relatively recent inventions. Face to face communication has been fine tuned by millions of years of evolution. That's what's made it into this mysterious  powerful thing it is. Someone speaks  there's resonance in all these receiving brains  the whole group acts together. I mean  this is the connective tissue of the human superorganism in action. It's probably driven our culture for millennia.     years ago  it ran into a competitor with a lethal advantage. It's right here. Print scaled. The world's ambitious innovators and influencers now could get their ideas to spread far and wide  and so the art of the spoken word pretty much withered on the vine. But now  in the blink of an eye  the game has changed again. It's not too much to say that what Gutenberg did for writing  online video can now do for face to face communication. So  that primal medium  which your brain is exquisitely wired for ... that just went global. Now  this is big. We may have to reinvent an ancient art form. I mean  today  one person speaking can be seen by millions  shedding bright light on potent ideas  creating intense desire for learning and to respond    and in his case  intense desire to laugh. For the first time in human history  talented students don't have to have their potential and their dreams written out of history by lousy teachers. They can sit two feet in front of the world's finest. Now  TED is just a small part of this. I mean  the world's universities are opening up their curricula. Thousands of individuals and organizations are sharing their knowledge and data online. Thousands of people are figuring out new ways to learn and  crucially  to respond  completing the cycle. And so  as we've thought about this  you know  it's become clear to us what the next stage of TED's evolution has to be. TEDTalks can't be a one way process  one to many. Our future is many to many. So  we're dreaming of ways to make it easier for you  the global TED community  to respond to speakers  to contribute your own ideas  maybe even your own TEDTalks  and to help shine a light on the very best of what's out there. Because  if we can bubble up the very best from a vastly larger pool  this wheel turns. Now  is it possible to imagine a similar process to this  happening to global education overall  I mean  does it have to be this painful  top down process  Why not a self fueling cycle in which we all can participate  It's the participation age  right  Schools can't be silos. We can't stop learning at age   . What if  in the coming crowd of nine billion ... what if that crowd could learn enough to be net contributors  instead of net plunderers  That changes everything  right  I mean  that would take more teachers than we've ever had. But the good news is they are out there. They're in the crowd  and the crowd is switching on lights  and we can see them for the first time  not as an undifferentiated mass of strangers  but as individuals we can learn from. Who's the teacher  You're the teacher. You're part of the crowd that may be about to launch the biggest learning cycle in human history  a cycle capable of carrying all of us to a smarter  wiser  more beautiful place. Here's a group of kids in a village in Pakistan near where I grew up. Within five years  each of these kids is going to have access to a cellphone capable of full on web video and capable of uploading video to the web. I mean  is it crazy to think that this girl  in the back  at the right  in    years  might be sharing the idea that keeps the world beautiful for your grandchildren  It's not crazy  it's actually happening right now. I want to introduce you to a good friend of TED who just happens to live in Africa's biggest shantytown. I'm one of the organizers of TEDxKibera. There are so many good things which are happening right here in Kibera. There's a self help group. They turned a trash place into a garden. The same spot  it was a crime spot where people were being robbed. They used the same trash to form green manure. The same trash site is feeding more than    families. We have our own film school. They are using Flip cameras to record  edit  and reporting to their own channel  Kibera TV. Because of a scarcity of land  we are using the sacks to grow vegetables  and also  we're  able to save on the cost of living. Change happens when we see things in a different way. Today  I see Kibera in a different way. My message to TEDGlobal and the entire world is  Kibera is a hotbed of innovation and ideas. CA  You know what  I bet Chris has always been an inspiring guy. What's new    and it's huge    is that  for the first time  we get to see him  and he can see us. Right now  Chris and Kevin and Dennis and Dickson and their friends are watching us  in Nairobi  right now. Guys  we've learned from you today. Thank you. And thank you. Let's start with day and night. Life evolved under conditions of light and darkness  light and then darkness. And so plants and animals developed their own internal clocks so that they would be ready for these changes in light. These are chemical clocks  and they're found in every known being that has two or more cells and in some that only have one cell. I'll give you an example    if you take a horseshoe crab off the beach  and you fly it all the way across the continent  and you drop it into a sloped cage  it will scramble up the floor of the cage as the tide is rising on its home shores  and it'll skitter down again right as the water is receding thousands of miles away. It'll do this for weeks  until it kind of gradually loses the plot. And it's incredible to watch  but there's nothing psychic or paranormal going on  it's simply that these crabs have internal cycles that correspond  usually  with what's going on around it. So  we have this ability as well. And in humans  we call it the  body clock.  You can see this most clearly when you take away someone's watch and you shut them into a bunker  deep underground  for a couple of months.  Laughter  People actually volunteer for this  and they usually come out kind of raving about their productive time in the hole. So  no matter how atypical these subjects would have to be  they all show the same thing. They get up just a little bit later every day    say    minutes or so    and they kind of drift all the way around the clock like this over the course of the weeks. And so  in this way we know that they are working on their own internal clocks  rather than somehow sensing the day outside. So fine  we have a body clock  and it turns out that it's incredibly important in our lives. It's a huge driver for culture and I think that it's the most underrated force on our behavior. We evolved as a species near the equator  and so we're very well equipped to deal with    hours of daylight and    hours of darkness. But of course  we've spread to every corner of the globe and in Arctic Canada  where I live  we have perpetual daylight in summer and    hours of darkness in winter. So the culture  the northern aboriginal culture  traditionally has been highly seasonal. In winter  there's a lot of sleeping going on  you enjoy your family life inside. And in summer  it's almost manic hunting and working activity very long hours  very active. So  what would our natural rhythm look like  What would our sleeping patterns be in the sort of ideal sense  Well  it turns out that when people are living without any sort of artificial light at all  they sleep twice every night. They go to bed around      p.m. until midnight and then again  they sleep from about      a.m. until sunrise. And in between  they have a couple of hours of sort of meditative quiet in bed. And during this time  there's a surge of prolactin  the likes of which a modern day never sees. The people in these studies report feeling so awake during the daytime  that they realize they're experiencing true wakefulness for the first time in their lives. So  cut to the modern day. We're living in a culture of jet lag  global travel     hour business  shift work. And you know  our modern ways of doing things have their advantages  but I believe we should understand the costs. Thank you. For the last    years  I've been spending my time trying to figure out how and why human beings assemble themselves into social networks. And the kind of social network I'm talking about is not the recent online variety  but rather  the kind of social networks that human beings have been assembling for hundreds of thousands of years  ever since we emerged from the African savannah. So  I form friendships and co worker and sibling and relative relationships with other people who in turn have similar relationships with other people. And this spreads on out endlessly into a distance. And you get a network that looks like this. Every dot is a person. Every line between them is a relationship between two people    different kinds of relationships. And you can get this kind of vast fabric of humanity  in which we're all embedded. And my colleague  James Fowler and I have been studying for quite sometime what are the mathematical  social  biological and psychological rules that govern how these networks are assembled and what are the similar rules that govern how they operate  how they affect our lives. But recently  we've been wondering whether it might be possible to take advantage of this insight  to actually find ways to improve the world  to do something better  to actually fix things  not just understand things. So one of the first things we thought we would tackle would be how we go about predicting epidemics. And the current state of the art in predicting an epidemic    if you're the CDC or some other national body    is to sit in the middle where you are and collect data from physicians and laboratories in the field that report the prevalence or the incidence of certain conditions. So  so and so patients have been diagnosed with something  or other patients have been diagnosed  and all these data are fed into a central repository  with some delay. And if everything goes smoothly  one to two weeks from now you'll know where the epidemic was today. And actually  about a year or so ago  there was this promulgation of the idea of Google Flu Trends  with respect to the flu  where by looking at people's searching behavior today  we could know where the flu    what the status of the epidemic was today  what's the prevalence of the epidemic today. But what I'd like to show you today is a means by which we might get not just rapid warning about an epidemic  but also actually early detection of an epidemic. And  in fact  this idea can be used not just to predict epidemics of germs  but also to predict epidemics of all sorts of kinds. For example  anything that spreads by a form of social contagion could be understood in this way  from abstract ideas on the left like patriotism  or altruism  or religion to practices like dieting behavior  or book purchasing  or drinking  or bicycle helmet  and  other safety practices  or products that people might buy  purchases of electronic goods  anything in which there's kind of an interpersonal spread. A kind of a diffusion of innovation could be understood and predicted by the mechanism I'm going to show you now. So  as all of you probably know  the classic way of thinking about this is the diffusion of innovation  or the adoption curve. So here on the Y axis  we have the percent of the people affected  and on the X axis  we have time. And at the very beginning  not too many people are affected  and you get this classic sigmoidal  or S shaped  curve. And the reason for this shape is that at the very beginning  let's say one or two people are infected  or affected by the thing and then they affect  or infect  two people  who in turn affect four  eight     and so forth  and you get the epidemic growth phase of the curve. And eventually  you saturate the population. There are fewer and fewer people who are still available that you might infect  and then you get the plateau of the curve  and you get this classic sigmoidal curve. And this holds for germs  ideas  product adoption  behaviors  and the like. But things don't just diffuse in human populations at random. They actually diffuse through networks. Because  as I said  we live our lives in networks  and these networks have a particular kind of a structure. Now if you look at a network like this    this is     people. And the lines represent    the dots are the people  and the lines represent friendship relationships. You might see that people occupy different locations within the network. And there are different kinds of relationships between the people. You could have friendship relationships  sibling relationships  spousal relationships  co worker relationships  neighbor relationships and the like. And different sorts of things spread across different sorts of ties. For instance  sexually transmitted diseases will spread across sexual ties. Or  for instance  people's smoking behavior might be influenced by their friends. Or their altruistic or their charitable giving behavior might be influenced by their coworkers  or by their neighbors. But not all positions in the network are the same. So if you look at this  you might immediately grasp that different people have different numbers of connections. Some people have one connection  some have two  some have six  some have    connections. And this is called the  degree  of a node  or the number of connections that a node has. But in addition  there's something else. So  if you look at nodes A and B  they both have six connections. But if you can see this image  of the network  from a bird's eye view  you can appreciate that there's something very different about nodes A and B. So  let me ask you this    I can cultivate this intuition by asking a question    who would you rather be if a deadly germ was spreading through the network  A or B  B is located on the edge of the network. Now  who would you rather be if a juicy piece of gossip were spreading through the network  A. And you have an immediate appreciation that A is going to be more likely to get the thing that's spreading and to get it sooner by virtue of their structural location within the network. A  in fact  is more central  and this can be formalized mathematically. So  if we want to track something that was spreading through a network  what we ideally would like to do is to set up sensors on the central individuals within the network  including node A  monitor those people that are right there in the middle of the network  and somehow get an early detection of whatever it is that is spreading through the network. So if you saw them contract a germ or a piece of information  you would know that  soon enough  everybody was about to contract this germ or this piece of information. And this would be much better than monitoring six randomly chosen people  without reference to the structure of the population. And in fact  if you could do that  what you would see is something like this. On the left hand panel  again  we have the S shaped curve of adoption. In the dotted red line  we show what the adoption would be in the random people  and in the left hand line  shifted to the left  we show what the adoption would be in the central individuals within the network. On the Y axis is the cumulative instances of contagion  and on the X axis is the time. And on the right hand side  we show the same data  but here with daily incidence. And what we show here is    like  here    very few people are affected  more and more and more and up to here  and here's the peak of the epidemic. But shifted to the left is what's occurring in the central individuals. And this difference in time between the two is the early detection  the early warning we can get  about an impending epidemic in the human population. The problem  however  is that mapping human social networks is not always possible. It can be expensive  not feasible  unethical  or  frankly  just not possible to do such a thing. So  how can we figure out who the central people are in a network without actually mapping the network  What we came up with was an idea to exploit an old fact  or a known fact  about social networks  which goes like this  Do you know that your friends have more friends than you do  Your friends have more friends than you do  and this is known as the friendship paradox. Imagine a very popular person in the social network    like a party host who has hundreds of friends    and a misanthrope who has just one friend  and you pick someone at random from the population  they were much more likely to know the party host. And if they nominate the party host as their friend  that party host has a hundred friends  therefore  has more friends than they do. And this  in essence  is what's known as the friendship paradox. The friends of randomly chosen people have higher degree  and are more central than the random people themselves. And you can get an intuitive appreciation for this if you imagine just the people at the perimeter of the network. If you pick this person  the only friend they have to nominate is this person  who  by construction  must have at least two and typically more friends. And that happens at every peripheral node. And in fact  it happens throughout the network as you move in  everyone you pick  when they nominate a random    when a random person nominates a friend of theirs  you move closer to the center of the network. So  we thought we would exploit this idea in order to study whether we could predict phenomena within networks. Because now  with this idea we can take a random sample of people  have them nominate their friends  those friends would be more central  and we could do this without having to map the network. And we tested this idea with an outbreak of H N  flu at Harvard College in the fall and winter of       just a few months ago. We took       randomly selected undergraduates  we had them nominate their friends  and we followed both the random students and their friends daily in time to see whether or not they had the flu epidemic. And we did this passively by looking at whether or not they'd gone to university health services. And also  we had them  actively  email us a couple of times a week. Exactly what we predicted happened. So the random group is in the red line. The epidemic in the friends group has shifted to the left  over here. And the difference in the two is    days. By monitoring the friends group  we could get    days advance warning of an impending epidemic in this human population. Now  in addition to that  if you were an analyst who was trying to study an epidemic or to predict the adoption of a product  for example  what you could do is you could pick a random sample of the population  also have them nominate their friends and follow the friends and follow both the randoms and the friends. Among the friends  the first evidence you saw of a blip above zero in adoption of the innovation  for example  would be evidence of an impending epidemic. Or you could see the first time the two curves diverged  as shown on the left. When did the randoms    when did the friends take off and leave the randoms  and  when did  their curve start shifting  And that  as indicated by the white line  occurred    days before the peak of the epidemic. So this would be a technique whereby we could get more than a month and a half warning about a flu epidemic in a particular population. I should say that how far advanced a notice one might get about something depends on a host of factors. It could depend on the nature of the pathogen    different pathogens  using this technique  you'd get different warning    or other phenomena that are spreading  or frankly  on the structure of the human network. Now in our case  although it wasn't necessary  we could also actually map the network of the students. So  this is a map of     students and their friendship ties. And in a minute now  I'm going to put this map into motion. We're going to take daily cuts through the network for     days. The red dots are going to be cases of the flu  and the yellow dots are going to be friends of the people with the flu. And the size of the dots is going to be proportional to how many of their friends have the flu. So bigger dots mean more of your friends have the flu. And if you look at this image    here we are now in September the   th    you're going to see a few cases light up. You're going to see kind of blooming of the flu in the middle. Here we are on October the   th. The slope of the epidemic curve is approaching now  in November. Bang  bang  bang  bang  bang    you're going to see lots of blooming in the middle  and then you're going to see a sort of leveling off  fewer and fewer cases towards the end of December. And this type of a visualization can show that epidemics like this take root and affect central individuals first  before they affect others. Now  as I've been suggesting  this method is not restricted to germs  but actually to anything that spreads in populations. Information spreads in populations  norms can spread in populations  behaviors can spread in populations. And by behaviors  I can mean things like criminal behavior  or voting behavior  or health care behavior  like smoking  or vaccination  or product adoption  or other kinds of behaviors that relate to interpersonal influence. If I'm likely to do something that affects others around me  this technique can get early warning or early detection about the adoption within the population. The key thing is that for it to work  there has to be interpersonal influence. It cannot be because of some broadcast mechanism affecting everyone uniformly. Now the same insights can also be exploited    with respect to networks    can also be exploited in other ways  for example  in the use of targeting specific people for interventions. So  for example  most of you are probably familiar with the notion of herd immunity. So  if we have a population of a thousand people  and we want to make the population immune to a pathogen  we don't have to immunize every single person. If we immunize     of them  it's as if we had immunized a hundred  percent  of them. Because even if one or two of the non immune people gets infected  there's no one for them to infect. They are surrounded by immunized people. So    percent is as good as     percent. Well  some other scientists have estimated what would happen if you took a    percent random sample of these      people      people and immunized them. Would you get any population level immunity  And the answer is no. But if you took this    percent  these     people and had them nominate their friends and took the same number of vaccine doses and vaccinated the friends of the        the     friends    you can get the same level of herd immunity as if you had vaccinated    percent of the population at a much greater efficiency  with a strict budget constraint. And similar ideas can be used  for instance  to target distribution of things like bed nets in the developing world. If we could understand the structure of networks in villages  we could target to whom to give the interventions to foster these kinds of spreads. Or  frankly  for advertising with all kinds of products. If we could understand how to target  it could affect the efficiency of what we're trying to achieve. And in fact  we can use data from all kinds of sources nowadays  to do this . This is a map of eight million phone users in a European country. Every dot is a person  and every line represents a volume of calls between the people. And we can use such data  that's being passively obtained  to map these whole countries and understand who is located where within the network. Without actually having to query them at all  we can get this kind of a structural insight. And other sources of information  as you're no doubt aware are available about such features  from email interactions  online interactions  online social networks and so forth. And in fact  we are in the era of what I would call  massive passive  data collection efforts. They're all kinds of ways we can use massively collected data to create sensor networks to follow the population  understand what's happening in the population  and intervene in the population for the better. Because these new technologies tell us not just who is talking to whom  but where everyone is  and what they're thinking based on what they're uploading on the Internet  and what they're buying based on their purchases. And all this administrative data can be pulled together and processed to understand human behavior in a way we never could before. So  for example  we could use truckers' purchases of fuel. So the truckers are just going about their business  and they're buying fuel. And we see a blip up in the truckers' purchases of fuel  and we know that a recession is about to end. Or we can monitor the velocity with which people are moving with their phones on a highway  and the phone company can see  as the velocity is slowing down  that there's a traffic jam. And they can feed that information back to their subscribers  but only to their subscribers on the same highway located behind the traffic jam  Or we can monitor doctors prescribing behaviors  passively  and see how the diffusion of innovation with pharmaceuticals occurs within  networks of  doctors. Or again  we can monitor purchasing behavior in people and watch how these types of phenomena can diffuse within human populations. And there are three ways  I think  that these massive passive data can be used. One is fully passive  like I just described    as in  for instance  the trucker example  where we don't actually intervene in the population in any way. One is quasi active  like the flu example I gave  where we get some people to nominate their friends and then passively monitor their friends    do they have the flu  or not     and then get warning. Or another example would be  if you're a phone company  you figure out who's central in the network and you ask those people   Look  will you just text us your fever every day  Just text us your temperature.  And collect vast amounts of information about people's temperature  but from centrally located individuals. And be able  on a large scale  to monitor an impending epidemic with very minimal input from people. Or  finally  it can be more fully active    as I know subsequent speakers will also talk about today    where people might globally participate in wikis  or photographing  or monitoring elections  and upload information in a way that allows us to pool information in order to understand social processes and social phenomena. In fact  the availability of these data  I think  heralds a kind of new era of what I and others would like to call  computational social science.  It's sort of like when Galileo invented    or  didn't invent    came to use a telescope and could see the heavens in a new way  or Leeuwenhoek became aware of the microscope    or actually invented    and could see biology in a new way. But now we have access to these kinds of data that allow us to understand social processes and social phenomena in an entirely new way that was never before possible. And with this science  we can understand how exactly the whole comes to be greater than the sum of its parts. And actually  we can use these insights to improve society and improve human well being. Thank you. Now  since this is TEDGlobal  who can tell me what this is called in French  I see you're all up on the history of hurdy gurdy     vielle   roue.  And in Spanish   zanfona.  And in Italian   ghironda   okay  Hurdy gurdy  or wheel fiddle. So  these are the different kinds and shapes of the hurdy gurdy. The hurdy gurdy is the only musical instrument that uses a crank to turn a wheel to rub strings  like the bow of a violin  to produce music. It has three different kinds of strings. The first string is the drone string  which plays a continuous sound like the bagpipe. The second string is a melody string  which is played with a wooden keyboard tuned like a piano. And the third string is pretty innovative. It's also the only instrument that uses this kind of technique. It activates what's called the buzzing bridge  or the dog. When I turn the crank and I apply pressure  it makes a sound like a barking dog. So all of this is pretty innovative  if you consider that the hurdy gurdy appeared about a thousand years ago and it took two people to play it  one to turn the crank  and another person    yes    to play the melody by physically pulling up large wooden pegs. Luckily  all of this changed a couple of centuries later. So  one person could actually play and almost    this is pretty heavy    carry the hurdy gurdy. The hurdy gurdy has been used  historically  through the centuries in mostly dance music because of the uniqueness of the melody combined with the acoustic boombox here. And today  the hurdy gurdy is used in all sorts of music    traditional folk music  dance  contemporary and world music    in the U.K.  in France  in Spain and in Italy. And this kind of hurdy gurdy takes anywhere from three to five years  to order and receive it . It's made by specialized luthiers  also in Europe. And it's very difficult to tune. So without further ado  would you like to hear it  Caroline Phillips  I didn't hear you. Would you like to hear it   Audience  Yes   CP  Okay. There I go. I'd like to sing in Basque  which is the language spoken in the Basque Country where I live  in the region in France and Spain.  Basque  Thank you. This is a song that I wrote based on traditional Basque rhythms. And this is a song that has a kind of a Celtic feel. Thank you. Thank you. Hello. I would like to start my talk with actually two questions  and the first one is  How many people here actually eat pig meat  Please raise your hand    oh  that's a lot. And how many people have actually seen a live pig producing this meat  In the last year  In the Netherlands    where I come from    you actually never see a pig  which is really strange  because  on a population of    million people  we have    million pigs. And well  of course  the Dutch can't eat all these pigs. They eat about one third  and the rest is exported to all kinds of countries in Europe and the rest of the world. A lot goes to the U.K.  Germany. And what I was curious about    because historically  the whole pig would be used up until the last bit so nothing would be wasted    and I was curious to find out if this was actually still the case. And I spent about three years researching. And I followed this one pig with number          all the way up until the end and to what products it's made of. And in these years  I met all kinds people like  for instance  farmers and butchers  which seems logical. But I also met aluminum mold makers  ammunition producers and all kinds of people. And what was striking to me is that the farmers actually had no clue what was made of their pigs  but the consumers    as in us    had also no idea of the pigs being in all these products. So what I did is  I took all this research and I made it into a    well  basically it's a product catalog of this one pig  and it carries a duplicate of his ear tag on the back. And it consists of seven chapters    the chapters are skin  bones  meat  internal organs  blood  fat and miscellaneous. In total  they weigh    .  kilograms. And to show you how often you actually meet part of this pig in a regular day  I want to show you some images of the book. You probably start the day with a shower. So  in soap  fatty acids made from boiling pork bone fat are used as a hardening agent  but also for giving it a pearl like effect. Then if you look around you in the bathroom  you see lots more products like shampoo  conditioner  anti wrinkle cream  body lotion  but also toothpaste. Then  so  before breakfast  you've already met the pig so many times. Then  at breakfast  the pig that I followed  the hairs off the pig or proteins from the hairs off the pig were used as an improver of dough. Well  that's what the producer says  it's  improving the dough  of course.  In low fat butter  or actually in many low fat products  when you take the fat out  you actually take the taste and the texture out. So what they do is they put gelatin back in  in order to retain the texture. Well  when you're off to work  under the road or under the buildings that you see  there might very well be cellular concrete  which is a very light kind of concrete that's actually got proteins from bones inside and it's also fully reusable. In the train brakes    at least in the German train brakes    there's this part of the brake that's made of bone ash. And in cheesecake and all kinds of desserts  like chocolate mousse  tiramisu  vanilla pudding  everything that's cooled in the supermarket  there's gelatin to make it look good. Fine bone china    this is a real classic. Of course  the bone in fine bone china gives it its translucency and also its strength  in order to make these really fine shapes  like this deer. In interior decorating  the pig's actually quite there. It's used in paint for the texture  but also for the glossiness. In sandpaper  bone glue is actually the glue between the sand and the paper. And then in paintbrushes  hairs are used because  apparently  they're very suitable for making paintbrushes because of their hard wearing nature. I was not planning on showing you any meat because  of course  half the book's meat and you probably all know what meats they are. But I didn't want you to miss out on this one  because this  well  it's called  portion controlled meat cuts.  And this is actually sold in the frozen area of the supermarket. And what it is    it's actually steak. So  this is sold as cow  but what happens when you slaughter a cow    at least in industrial factory farming    they have all these little bits of steak left that they can't actually sell as steak  so what they do is they glue them all together with fibrin from pig blood into this really large sausage  then freeze the sausage  cut it in little slices and sell those as steak again. And this also actually happens with tuna and scallops. So  with the steak  you might drink a beer. In the brewing process  there's lots of cloudy elements in the beer  so to get rid of these cloudy elements  what some companies do is they pour the beer through a sort of gelatin sieve in order to get rid of that cloudiness. This actually also goes for wine as well as fruit juice. There's actually a company in Greece that produces these cigarettes that actually contain hemoglobin from pigs in the filter. And according to them  this creates an artificial lung in the filter. So  this is actually a healthier cigarette. Injectable collagen    or  since the '  s  collagen from pigs    has been used for injecting into wrinkles. And the reason for this is that pigs are actually quite close to human beings  so the collagen is as well. Well  this must be the strangest thing I found. This is a bullet coming from a very large ammunition company in the United States. And while I was making the book  I contacted all the producers of products because I wanted them to send me the real samples and the real specimens. So I sent this company an email saying   Hello. I'm Christien. I'm doing this research. And can you send me a bullet   And well  I didn't expect them to even answer my email. But they answered and they said   Why  thank you for your email. What an interesting story. Are you in anyway related to the Dutch government   I thought that was really weird  as if the Dutch government sends emails to anyone. So  the most beautiful thing I found    at least what I think is the most beautiful    in the book  is this heart valve. It's actually a very low tech and very high tech product at the same time. The low tech bit is that it's literally a pig's heart valve mounted in the high tech bit  which is a memory metal casing. And what happens is this can be implanted into a human heart without open heart surgery. And once it's in the right spot  they remove the outer shell  and the heart valve  well  it gets this shape and at that moment it starts beating  instantly. It's really a sort of magical moment. So this is actually a Dutch company  so I called them up  and I asked   Can I borrow a heart valve from you   And the makers of this thing were really enthusiastic. So they were like   Okay  we'll put it in a jar for you with formalin  and you can borrow it.  Great    and then I didn't hear from them for weeks  so I called  and I asked   What's going on with the heart valve   And they said   Well the director of the company decided not to let you borrow this heart valve  because want his product to be associated with pigs.  Well  the last product from the book that I'm showing you is renewable energy    actually  to show that my first question  if pigs are still used up until the last bit  was still true. Well it is  because everything that can't be used for anything else is made into a fuel that can be used as renewable energy source. In total  I found     products. And what they showed me is that  well  firstly  it's at least to say odd that we don't treat these pigs as absolute kings and queens. And the second  is that we actually don't have a clue of what all these products that surround us are made of. And you might think I'm very fond of pigs  but actually    well  I am a little bit    but I'm more fond of raw materials in general. And I think that  in order to take better care of what's behind our products    so  the livestock  the crops  the plants  the non renewable materials  but also the people that produce these products    the first step would actually be to know that they are there. Thank you very much. Just a few minutes ago  I took this picture about    blocks from here. This is the Grand Cafe here in Oxford. I took this picture because this turns out to be the first coffeehouse to open in England in     . That's its great claim to fame  and I wanted to show it to you  not because I want to give you the kind of Starbucks tour of historic England  but rather because the English coffeehouse was crucial to the development and spread of one of the great intellectual flowerings of the last     years  what we now call the Enlightenment. And the coffeehouse played such a big role in the birth of the Enlightenment  in part  because of what people were drinking there. Because  before the spread of coffee and tea through British culture  what people drank    both elite and mass folks drank    day in and day out  from dawn until dusk was alcohol. Alcohol was the daytime beverage of choice. You would drink a little beer with breakfast and have a little wine at lunch  a little gin    particularly around         and top it off with a little beer and wine at the end of the day. That was the healthy choice    right    because the water wasn't safe to drink. And so  effectively until the rise of the coffeehouse  you had an entire population that was effectively drunk all day. And you can imagine what that would be like  right  in your own life    and I know this is true of some of you    if you were drinking all day  and then you switched from a depressant to a stimulant in your life  you would have better ideas. You would be sharper and more alert. And so it's not an accident that a great flowering of innovation happened as England switched to tea and coffee. But the other thing that makes the coffeehouse important is the architecture of the space. It was a space where people would get together from different backgrounds  different fields of expertise  and share. It was a space  as Matt Ridley talked about  where ideas could have sex. This was their conjugal bed  in a sense    ideas would get together there. And an astonishing number of innovations from this period have a coffeehouse somewhere in their story. I've been spending a lot of time thinking about coffeehouses for the last five years  because I've been kind of on this quest to investigate this question of where good ideas come from. What are the environments that lead to unusual levels of innovation  unusual levels of creativity  What's the kind of environmental    what is the space of creativity  And what I've done is I've looked at both environments like the coffeehouse  I've looked at media environments  like the world wide web  that have been extraordinarily innovative  I've gone back to the history of the first cities  I've even gone to biological environments  like coral reefs and rainforests  that involve unusual levels of biological innovation  and what I've been looking for is shared patterns  kind of signature behavior that shows up again and again in all of these environments. Are there recurring patterns that we can learn from  that we can take and kind of apply to our own lives  or our own organizations  or our own environments to make them more creative and innovative  And I think I've found a few. But what you have to do to make sense of this and to really understand these principles is you have to do away with a lot of the way in which our conventional metaphors and language steers us towards certain concepts of idea creation. We have this very rich vocabulary to describe moments of inspiration. We have the kind of the flash of insight  the stroke of insight  we have epiphanies  we have  eureka   moments  we have the lightbulb moments  right  All of these concepts  as kind of rhetorically florid as they are  share this basic assumption  which is that an idea is a single thing  it's something that happens often in a wonderful illuminating moment. But in fact  what I would argue and what you really need to kind of begin with is this idea that an idea is a network on the most elemental level. I mean  this is what is happening inside your brain. An idea    a new idea    is a new network of neurons firing in sync with each other inside your brain. It's a new configuration that has never formed before. And the question is  how do you get your brain into environments where these new networks are going to be more likely to form  And it turns out that  in fact  the kind of network patterns of the outside world mimic a lot of the network patterns of the internal world of the human brain. So the metaphor I'd like the use I can take from a story of a great idea that's quite recent    a lot more recent than the     s. A wonderful guy named Timothy Prestero  who has a company called ... an organization called Design That Matters. They decided to tackle this really pressing problem of  you know  the terrible problems we have with infant mortality rates in the developing world. One of the things that's very frustrating about this is that we know  by getting modern neonatal incubators into any context  if we can keep premature babies warm  basically    it's very simple    we can halve infant mortality rates in those environments. So  the technology is there. These are standard in all the industrialized worlds. The problem is  if you buy a         incubator  and you send it off to a mid sized village in Africa  it will work great for a year or two years  and then something will go wrong and it will break  and it will remain broken forever  because you don't have a whole system of spare parts  and you don't have the on the ground expertise to fix this         piece of equipment. And so you end up having this problem where you spend all this money getting aid and all these advanced electronics to these countries  and then it ends up being useless. So what Prestero and his team decided to do is to look around and see  what are the abundant resources in these developing world contexts  And what they noticed was they don't have a lot of DVRs  they don't have a lot of microwaves  but they seem to do a pretty good job of keeping their cars on the road. There's a Toyota Forerunner on the street in all these places. They seem to have the expertise to keep cars working. So they started to think   Could we build a neonatal incubator that's built entirely out of automobile parts   And this is what they ended up coming with. It's called a  neonurture device.  From the outside  it looks like a normal little thing you'd find in a modern  Western hospital. In the inside  it's all car parts. It's got a fan  it's got headlights for warmth  it's got door chimes for alarm    it runs off a car battery. And so all you need is the spare parts from your Toyota and the ability to fix a headlight  and you can repair this thing. Now  that's a great idea  but what I'd like to say is that  in fact  this is a great metaphor for the way that ideas happen. We like to think our breakthrough ideas  you know  are like that          brand new incubator  state of the art technology  but more often than not  they're cobbled together from whatever parts that happen to be around nearby. We take ideas from other people  from people we've learned from  from people we run into in the coffee shop  and we stitch them together into new forms and we create something new. That's really where innovation happens. And that means that we have to change some of our models of what innovation and deep thinking really looks like  right. I mean  this is one vision of it. Another is Newton and the apple  when Newton was at Cambridge. This is a statue from Oxford. You know  you're sitting there thinking a deep thought  and the apple falls from the tree  and you have the theory of gravity. In fact  the spaces that have historically led to innovation tend to look like this  right. This is Hogarth's famous painting of a kind of political dinner at a tavern  but this is what the coffee shops looked like back then. This is the kind of chaotic environment where ideas were likely to come together  where people were likely to have new  interesting  unpredictable collisions    people from different backgrounds. So  if we're trying to build organizations that are more innovative  we have to build spaces that    strangely enough    look a little bit more like this. This is what your office should look like  is part of my message here. And one of the problems with this is that people are actually    when you research this field    people are notoriously unreliable  when they actually kind of self report on where they have their own good ideas  or their history of their best ideas. And a few years ago  a wonderful researcher named Kevin Dunbar decided to go around and basically do the Big Brother approach to figuring out where good ideas come from. He went to a bunch of science labs around the world and videotaped everyone as they were doing every little bit of their job. So when they were sitting in front of the microscope  when they were talking to their colleague at the water cooler  and all these things. And he recorded all of these conversations and tried to figure out where the most important ideas  where they happened. And when we think about the classic image of the scientist in the lab  we have this image    you know  they're pouring over the microscope  and they see something in the tissue sample. And  oh  eureka   they've got the idea. What happened actually when Dunbar kind of looked at the tape is that  in fact  almost all of the important breakthrough ideas did not happen alone in the lab  in front of the microscope. They happened at the conference table at the weekly lab meeting  when everybody got together and shared their kind of latest data and findings  oftentimes when people shared the mistakes they were having  the error  the noise in the signal they were discovering. And something about that environment    and I've started calling it the  liquid network   where you have lots of different ideas that are together  different backgrounds  different interests  jostling with each other  bouncing off each other    that environment is  in fact  the environment that leads to innovation. The other problem that people have is they like to condense their stories of innovation down to kind of shorter time frames. So they want to tell the story of the  eureka   moment. They want to say   There I was  I was standing there and I had it all suddenly clear in my head.  But in fact  if you go back and look at the historical record  it turns out that a lot of important ideas have very long incubation periods    I call this the  slow hunch.  We've heard a lot recently about hunch and instinct and blink like sudden moments of clarity  but in fact  a lot of great ideas linger on  sometimes for decades  in the back of people's minds. They have a feeling that there's an interesting problem  but they don't quite have the tools yet to discover them. They spend all this time working on certain problems  but there's another thing lingering there that they're interested in  but they can't quite solve. Darwin is a great example of this. Darwin himself  in his autobiography  tells the story of coming up with the idea for natural selection as a classic  eureka   moment. He's in his study  it's October of       and he's reading Malthus  actually  on population. And all of a sudden  the basic algorithm of natural selection kind of pops into his head and he says   Ah  at last  I had a theory with which to work.  That's in his autobiography. About a decade or two ago  a wonderful scholar named Howard Gruber went back and looked at Darwin's notebooks from this period. And Darwin kept these copious notebooks where he wrote down every little idea he had  every little hunch. And what Gruber found was that Darwin had the full theory of natural selection for months and months and months before he had his alleged epiphany  reading Malthus in October of     . There are passages where you can read it  and you think you're reading from a Darwin textbook  from the period before he has this epiphany. And so what you realize is that Darwin  in a sense  had the idea  he had the concept  but was unable of fully thinking it yet. And that is actually how great ideas often happen  they fade into view over long periods of time. Now the challenge for all of us is  how do you create environments that allow these ideas to have this kind of long half life  right  It's hard to go to your boss and say   I have an excellent idea for our organization. It will be useful in     . Could you just give me some time to do that   Now a couple of companies    like Google    they have innovation time off     percent time  where  in a sense  those are hunch cultivating mechanisms in an organization. But that's a key thing. And the other thing is to allow those hunches to connect with other people's hunches  that's what often happens. You have half of an idea  somebody else has the other half  and if you're in the right environment  they turn into something larger than the sum of their parts. So  in a sense  we often talk about the value of protecting intellectual property  you know  building barricades  having secretive R D labs  patenting everything that we have  so that those ideas will remain valuable  and people will be incentivized to come up with more ideas  and the culture will be more innovative. But I think there's a case to be made that we should spend at least as much time  if not more  valuing the premise of connecting ideas and not just protecting them. And I'll leave you with this story  which I think captures a lot of these values  and it's just wonderful kind of tale of innovation and how it happens in unlikely ways. It's October of       and Sputnik has just launched  and we're in Laurel Maryland  at the applied physics lab associated with Johns Hopkins University. And it's Monday morning  and the news has just broken about this satellite that's now orbiting the planet. And of course  this is nerd heaven  right  There are all these physics geeks who are there thinking   Oh my gosh  This is incredible. I can't believe this has happened.  And two of them  two    something researchers at the APL are there at the cafeteria table having an informal conversation with a bunch of their colleagues. And these two guys are named Guier and Weiffenbach. And they start talking  and one of them says   Hey  has anybody tried to listen for this thing  There's this  you know  man made satellite up there in outer space that's obviously broadcasting some kind of signal. We could probably hear it  if we tune in.  And so they ask around to a couple of their colleagues  and everybody's like   No  I hadn't thought of doing that. That's an interesting idea.  And it turns out Weiffenbach is kind of an expert in microwave reception  and he's got a little antennae set up with an amplifier in his office. And so Guier and Weiffenbach go back to Weiffenbach's office  and they start kind of noodling around    hacking  as we might call it now. And after a couple of hours  they actually start picking up the signal  because the Soviets made Sputnik very easy to track. It was right at    MHz  so you could pick it up really easily  because they were afraid that people would think it was a hoax  basically. So they made it really easy to find it. So these two guys are sitting there listening to this signal  and people start kind of coming into the office and saying   Wow  that's pretty cool. Can I hear  Wow  that's great.  And before long  they think   Well jeez  this is kind of historic. We may be the first people in the United States to be listening to this. We should record it.  And so they bring in this big  clunky analog tape recorder and they start recording these little bleep  bleeps. And they start writing the kind of date stamp  time stamps for each little bleep that they record. And they they start thinking   Well gosh  you know  we're noticing small little frequency variations here. We could probably calculate the speed that the satellite is traveling  if we do a little basic math here using the Doppler effect.  And then they played around with it a little bit more  and they talked to a couple of their colleagues who had other kind of specialties. And they said   Jeez  you know  we think we could actually take a look at the slope of the Doppler effect to figure out the points at which the satellite is closest to our antennae and the points at which it's farthest away. That's pretty cool.  And eventually  they get permission    this is all a little side project that hadn't been officially part of their job description. They get permission to use the new  you know  UNIVAC computer that takes up an entire room that they'd just gotten at the APL. They run some more of the numbers  and at the end of about three or four weeks  turns out they have mapped the exact trajectory of this satellite around the Earth  just from listening to this one little signal  going off on this little side hunch that they'd been inspired to do over lunch one morning. A couple weeks later their boss  Frank McClure  pulls them into the room and says   Hey  you guys  I have to ask you something about that project you were working on. You've figured out an unknown location of a satellite orbiting the planet from a known location on the ground. Could you go the other way  Could you figure out an unknown location on the ground  if you knew the location of the satellite   And they thought about it and they said   Well  I guess maybe you could. Let's run the numbers here.  So they went back  and they thought about it. And they came back and said   Actually  it'll be easier.  And he said   Oh  that's great. Because see  I have these new nuclear submarines that I'm building. And it's really hard to figure out how to get your missile so that it will land right on top of Moscow  if you don't know where the submarine is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. So we're thinking  we could throw up a bunch of satellites and use it to track our submarines and figure out their location in the middle of the ocean. Could you work on that problem   And that's how GPS was born.    years later  Ronald Reagan actually opened it up and made it an open platform that anybody could kind of build upon and anybody could come along and build new technology that would create and innovate on top of this open platform  left it open for anyone to do pretty much anything they wanted with it. And now  I guarantee you certainly half of this room  if not more  has a device sitting in their pocket right now that is talking to one of these satellites in outer space. And I bet you one of you  if not more  has used said device and said satellite system to locate a nearby coffeehouse somewhere in the last    in the last day or last week  right  And that  I think  is a great case study  a great lesson in the power  the marvelous  kind of unplanned emergent  unpredictable power of open innovative systems. When you build them right  they will be led to completely new directions that the creators never even dreamed of. I mean  here you have these guys who basically thought they were just following this hunch  this little passion that had developed  then they thought they were fighting the Cold War  and then it turns out they're just helping somebody find a soy latte. That is how innovation happens. Chance favors the connected mind. Thank you very much. I want you to take a trip with me. Picture yourself driving down a small road in Africa  and as you drive along  you look off to the side  and this is what you see  you see a field of graves. And you stop  and you get out of your car and you take a picture. And you go into the town  and you inquire   What's going on here   and people are initially reluctant to tell you. And then someone says   These are the recent AIDS deaths in our community.  HIV isn't like other medical conditions  it's stigmatizing. People are reluctant to talk about it    there's a fear associated with it. And I'm going to talk about HIV today  about the deaths  about the stigma. It's a medical story  but more than that  it's a social story. This map depicts the global distribution of HIV. And as you can see  Africa has a disproportionate share of the infection. There are    million people living with HIV in the world today. Of these  two thirds     million are living in sub Saharan Africa. There are  .  million pregnant women in low  and middle income countries living with HIV and of these     percent are in sub Saharan Africa. We talk about things in relative terms. And I'm going to talk about annual pregnancies and HIV positive mothers. The United States    a large country    each year        mothers with HIV who give birth to a child. But you go to Rwanda    a very small country          mothers with HIV who are pregnant. And then you go to Baragwanath Hospital  outside of Johannesburg in South Africa  and       HIV positive pregnant women giving birth    a hospital the same as a country. And to realize that this is just the tip of an iceberg that when you compare everything here to South Africa  it just pales  because in South Africa  each year         mothers with HIV give birth to children. So we talk about PMTCT  and we refer to PMTCT  prevention of mother to child transmission. I think there's an assumption amongst most people in the public that if a mother is HIV positive  she's going to infect her child. The reality is really  very different. In resource rich countries  with all the tests and treatment we currently have  less than two percent of babies are born HIV positive       percent of babies are born HIV negative. And yet  the reality in resource poor countries  in the absence of tests and treatment     percent       percent of children are infected       percent versus two percent    an enormous difference. So these programs    and I'm going to refer to PMTCT though my talk    these prevention programs  simply  they're the tests and the drugs that we give to mothers to prevent them from infecting their babies  and also the medicines we give to mothers to keep them healthy and alive to raise their children. So it's the test a mother gets when she comes in. It's the drugs she receives to protect the baby that's inside the uterus and during delivery. It's the guidance she gets around infant feeding and safer sex. It's an entire package of services  and it works. So in the United States  since the advent of treatment in the middle of the     s  there's been an    percent decline in the number of HIV infected children. Less than     babies are born with HIV each year in the United States and yet  still  over         children are born every year in the world today with HIV. What does that mean  It means       children infected each day          children each day  infected with HIV. And where do they come from  Well  less than one comes from the United States. One  on average  comes from Europe.     come from Asia and the Pacific. And each day  a thousand babies    a thousand babies are born each day with HIV in Africa. So again  I look at the globe here and the disproportionate share of HIV in Africa. And let's look at another map. And here  again  we see Africa has a disproportionate share of the numbers of doctors. That thin sliver you see here  that's Africa. And it's the same with nurses. The truth is sub Saharan Africa has    percent of the global disease burden and yet only three percent of the world's health care workers. That means doctors and nurses simply don't have the time to take care of patients. A nurse in a busy clinic will see    to     patients in a day  which leaves her just minutes per patient    minutes per patient. And so when we look at these PMTCT programs  what does it mean  Well  back in       when there was just a simple test and a single dose of a drug  a nurse  in the course of her few minutes with a patient  would have to counsel for the HIV test  perform the HIV test  explain the results  dispense a single dose of the drug  Nevirapine  explain how to take it  discuss infant feeding options  reinforce infant feeding  and test the baby    in minutes. Well  fortunately since       we've got new treatments  new tests  and we're far more successful  but we don't have any more nurses. And so these are the tests a nurse now has to do in those same few minutes. It's not possible    it doesn't work. And so we need to find better ways of providing care. This is a picture of a maternal health clinic in Africa    mothers coming  pregnant and with their babies. These women are here for care  but we know that just doing a test  just giving someone a drug  it's not enough. Meds don't equal medical care. Doctors and nurses  frankly  don't have the time or skills to tell people what to do in ways they understand. I'm a doctor    I tell people things to do  and I expect them to follow my guidance    because I'm a doctor  I went to Harvard    but the reality is  if I tell a patient   You should have safer sex. You should always use a condom   and yet  in her relationship  she's not empowered    what's going to happen  If I tell her to take her medicines every day and yet  no one in the household knows about her illness  so it's just not going to work. And so we need to do more  we need to do it differently  we need to do it in ways that are affordable and accessible and can be taken to scale  which means it can be done everywhere. So  I want to tell you a story    I want to take you on a little trip. Imagine yourself  if you can  you're a young woman in Africa  you're going to the hospital or clinic. You go in for a test and you find out that you're pregnant  and you're delighted. And then they give you another test and they tell you you're HIV positive  and you're devastated. And the nurse takes you into a room  and she tells you about the tests and HIV and the medicines you can take and how to take care of yourself and your baby  and you hear none of it. All you're hearing is   I'm going to die  and my baby is going to die.  And then you're out on the street  and you don't know where to go. And you don't know who you can talk to  because the truth is  HIV is so stigmatizing that if you partner  your family  anyone in your home  you're likely to be thrown out without any means of support. And this    this is the face and story of HIV in Africa today. But we're here to talk about possible solutions and some good news. And I want to change the story a little bit. Take the same mother  and the nurse  after she gives her her test  takes her to a room. The door opens and there's a room full of mothers  mothers with babies  and they're sitting  and they're talking  they're listening. They're drinking tea  they're having sandwiches. And she goes inside  and woman comes up to her and says   Welcome to mothers mothers. Have a seat. You're safe here. We're all HIV positive. You're going to be okay. You're going to live. Your baby is going to be HIV negative.  We view mothers as a community's single greatest resource. Mothers take care of the children  take care of the home. So often the men are gone. They're working  or they're not part of the household. Our organization  mothers mothers  enlists women with HIV as care providers. We bring mothers who have HIV  who've been through these PMTCT programs in the very facilities  to come back and work side by side with doctors and nurses as part of the health care team. These mothers  we call them mentor mothers  are able to engage women who  just like themselves  pregnant with babies  have found out about being HIV positive  who need support and education. And they support them around the diagnosis and educate them about how to take their medicines  how to take care of themselves  how to take care of their babies. Consider  if you needed surgery  you would want the best possible technical surgeon  right  But if you wanted to understand what that surgery would do to your life  you'd like to engage someone  someone who's had the procedure. Patients are experts on their own experience  and they can share that experience with others. This is the medical care that goes beyond just medicines. So the mothers who work for us  they come from the communities in which they work. They're hired    they're paid as professional members of the health care teams  just like doctors and nurses. And we open bank accounts for them and they're paid directly into the accounts  because their money's protected  the men can't take it away from them. They go through two to three weeks of rigorous curriculum based education  training. Now  doctors and nurses    they too get trained. But so often  they only get trained once  so they're not aware of new medicines  new guidelines as they come out. Our mentor mothers get trained every single year and retrained. And so doctors and nurses    they look up to them as experts. Imagine that  a woman  a former patient  being able to educate her doctor for the first time and educate the other patients that she's taking care of. Our organization has three goals. The first  to prevent mother to child transmission. The second  keep mothers healthy  keep mothers alive  keep the children alive    no more orphans. And the third  and maybe the most grand  is to find ways to empower women  enable them to fight the stigma and to live positive and productive lives with HIV. So how do we do it  Well  maybe the most important engagement is the one to one  seeing patients one to one  educating them  supporting them  explaining how they can take care of themselves. We go beyond that  we try to bring in the husbands  the partners. In Africa  it's very  very hard to engage men. Men are not frequently part of pregnancy care. But in Rwanda  in one country  they've got a policy that a woman can't come for care unless she brings the father of the baby with her    that's the rule. And so the father and the mother  together  go through the counseling and the testing. The father and the mother  together  they get the results. And this is so important in breaking through the stigma. Disclosure is so central to prevention. How do you have safer sex  how do you use a condom regularly if there hasn't been disclosure  Disclosure is so important to treatment  because again  people need the support of family members and friends to take their medicines regularly. We also work in groups. Now the groups  it's not like me lecturing  but what happens is women  they come together    under the support and guidance of our mentor mothers    they come together  and they share their personal experiences. And it's through the sharing that people get tactics of how to take care of themselves  how to disclose how to take medicines. And then there's the community outreach  engaging women in their communities. If we can change the way households believe and think  we can change the way communities believe and think. And if we can change enough communities  we can change national attitudes. We can change national attitudes to women and national attitudes to HIV. The hardest barrier really is around stigma reduction. We have the medicines  we have the tests  but how do you reduce the stigma  And it's important about disclosure. So  a couple years ago  one of the mentor mothers came back  and she told me a story. She had been asked by one of the clients to go to the home of the client  because the client wanted to tell the mother and her brothers and sisters about her HIV status  and she was afraid to go by herself. And so the mentor mother went along with. And the patient walked into the house and said to her mother and siblings   I have something to tell you. I'm HIV positive.  And everybody was quiet. And then her oldest brother stood up and said   I too have something to tell you. I'm HIV positive. I've been afraid to tell everybody.  And then this older sister stood up and said   I too am living with the virus  and I've been ashamed.  And then her younger brother stood up and said   I'm also positive. I thought you were going to throw me out of the family.  And you see where this is going. The last sister stood up and said   I'm also positive. I thought you were going to hate me.  And there they were  all of them together for the first time being able to share this experience for the first time and to support each other for the first time. and they are crying and scared. I tell them my story  that I am HIV positive  but my child is HIV negative. I tell them   You are going to make it  and you will raise a healthy baby.  I am proof that there is hope. Mitchell Besser  Remember the images I showed you of how few doctors and nurses there are in Africa. And it is a crisis in health care systems. Even as we have more tests and more drugs  we can't reach people  we don't have enough providers. So we talk in terms of what we call task shifting. Task shifting is traditionally when you take health care services from one provider and have another provider do it. Typically  it's a doctor giving a job to a nurse. And the issue in Africa is that there are fewer nurses  really than doctors  and so we need to find new paradigm for health care. How do you build a better health care system  We've chosen to redefine the health care system as a doctor  a nurse and a mentor mother. And so what nurses do is that they ask the mentor mothers to explain how to take the drugs  the side effects. They delegate education about infant feeding  family planning  safer sex  actions that nurses simple just don't have time for. So we go back to the prevention of mother to child transmission. The world is increasingly seeing these programs as the bridge to comprehensive maternal and child health. And our organization helps women across that bridge. The care doesn't stop when the baby's born    we deal with the ongoing health of the mother and baby  ensuring that they live healthy  successful lives. Our organization works on three levels. The first  at the patient level    mothers and babies keeping babies from getting HIV  keeping mothers healthy to raise them. The second  communities    empowering women. They become leaders within their communities. They change the way communities think    we need to change attitudes to HIV. We need to change attitudes to women in Africa. We have to do that. And then rework the level of the health care systems  building stronger health care systems. Our health care systems are broken. They're not going to work the way they're currently designed. And so doctors and nurses who need to try to change people's behaviors don't have the skills  don't have the time    our mentor mothers do. And so in redefining the health care teams by bringing the mentor mothers in  we can do that. I started the program in Capetown  South Africa back in     . It was at that point  just the spark of an idea. Referencing Steven Johnson's very lovely speech yesterday on where ideas come from  I was in the shower at the time    I was alone. The program is now working in nine countries  we have     program sites  we're seeing about         women every month  we're employing       mentor mothers  and last year  they enrolled         HIV positive pregnant women and mothers. That is    percent of the global HIV positive pregnant women       percent of the world. What's extraordinary is how simple the premise is. Mothers with HIV caring for mothers with HIV. Past patients taking care of present patients. And empowerment through employment    reducing stigma. hope that one day we shall win this fight against HIV and AIDS. Each person must know their HIV status. Those who are HIV negative must know how to stay negative. Those who are HIV infected must know how to take care of themselves. HIV positive pregnant women must get PMTCT services in order to have HIV negative babies. All of this is possible  if we each contribute to this fight. MB  Simple solutions to complex problems. Mothers caring for mothers. It's transformational. Thank you. I'm going to share with you the story as to how I have become an HIV AIDS campaigner. And this is the name of my campaign  SING Campaign. In November of       I was invited to take part in the launch of Nelson Mandela's       Foundation    that is his HIV AIDS foundation. And       is the number that Mandela had when he was imprisoned in Robben Island. And that's me with Youssou N'Dour  onstage  having the time of my life. The next day  all the artists were invited to join Mandela in Robben Island  where he was going to give a conference to the world's press  standing in front of his former prison cell. You can see the bars of the window there. It was quite a momentous occasion for all of us. In that moment in time  Mandela told the world's press that there was a virtual genocide taking place in his country  that post apartheid Rainbow Nation  a thousand people were dying on a daily basis and that the front line victims  the most vulnerable of all  were women and children. This was a huge impact on my mind  because I am a woman and I am a mother  and I hadn't realized that the HIV AIDS pandemic was directly affecting women in such a way. And so I committed    when I left South Africa  when I left Capetown  I told myself   This is going to be something that I have to talk about. I have to serve.  And so  subsequently I participated in every single       event that I could take part in and gave news conferences  interviews  talking and using my platform as a musician  with my commitment to Mandela    out of respect for the tremendous  unbelievable work that he had done. Everyone in the world respects Nelson Mandela  everyone reveres Nelson Mandela. But do they all know about what has been taking place in South Africa  his country  the country that had one of the highest incidents of transmission of the virus  I think that if I went out into the street now and I told people what was happening there  they would be shocked. I was very  very fortunate a couple of years later to have met Zackie Achmat  the founder of Treatment Action Campaign  an incredible campaigner and activist. I met him at a       event. He was wearing a t shirt like the one I wear now. This is a tool    this tells you I am in solidarity with people who have HIV  people who are living with HIV. And in a way because of the stigma  by wearing this t shirt I say   Yes  we can talk about this issue. It doesn't have to be in the closet.  I became a member of Treatment Action Campaign and I'm very proud to be a member of that incredible organization. It's a grassroots campaign with    percent membership being women  most of whom are HIV positive. They work in the field. They have tremendous outreach to the people who are living directly with the effects of the virus. They have education programs. They bring out the issues of stigma. It's quite extraordinary what they do. And yes  my SING Campaign has supported Treatment Action Campaign in the way that I have tried to raise awareness and to try to also raise funds. A lot of the funding that I have managed to raise has gone directly to Treatment Action Campaign and the incredible work that they do  and are still continuing to do in South Africa. So this is my SING Campaign. SING Campaign is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to support me. I've traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years    I went to about    different countries. Here I am in Oslo in Norway  getting a nice  fat check  singing in Hong Kong  trying to get people to raise money. In Johannesburg  I had the opportunity to play to a mainly white  middle class South African audience who ended up in tears because I use film clips that really touch the heart  the whole nature  of this terrible tragedy that is taking place  that people are tending to avoid  because they are fatigued  and they really don't quite know what the solutions are. Aaron Motsoaledi  the current health minister  attended that concert and I had an opportunity to meet with him  and he gave his absolute commitment to try to making a change  which is absolutely necessary. This is in the Scottish Parliament. I've subsequently become an envoy for Scotland and HIV. And I was showing them my experiences and trying to  again  raise awareness. And once again  in Edinburgh with the wonderful African Children's Choir who I simply adore. And it's children like this  many of whom have been orphaned because of their family being affected by the AIDS virus. I'm sitting here in New York with Michel Sidibe    he's the director of UNAIDS. And I'm very honored by the fact that Michel invited me  only a few months ago  to become a UNAIDS ambassador. And in this way  I've been strengthening my platform and broadening my outreach. The message that UNAIDS are currently sending out to the world is that we would like to see the virtual elimination of the transmission of the virus from mother to child by     . It's a very ambitious goal but we believe it can be achieved with political will. This can happen. And here I am with a pregnant woman  who is HIV positive and we're smiling  both of us are smiling  because we're very confident  because we know that that young woman is receiving treatment so her life can be extended to take care of the baby she's about to give birth to. And her baby will receive PMTCT  which will mean that that baby can be born free of the virus. Now that is prevention at the very beginning of life. It's one way to start looking at intervention with the AIDS pandemic. Now  I just would like to finish off to tell you the little story about Avelile. This is Avelile    she goes with me wherever I go. I tell her story to everyone because she represents one of millions of HIV AIDS orphans. Avelile's mother had HIV virus    she died from AIDS related illness. Avelile had the virus  she was born with the virus. And here she is at seven years old  weighing no more than a one year old baby. At this point in her life  she's suffering with full blown AIDS and had pneumonia. We met her in a hospital in the Eastern Cape and spent a whole afternoon with her    an adorable child. The doctors and nurses were phenomenal. They put her on very special nutritious diet and took great care of her. And we didn't know when we left the hospital    because we filmed her story    we didn't know if she was going to survive. So  it was obviously    it was a very emotional encounter and left us feeling very resonant with this direct experience  this one child  you know  that story. Five months later  we went back to South Africa to meet Avelile again. And I'm getting    the hairs on my    I don't know if you can see the hairs on my arms. They're standing up because I know what I'm going to show you. This is the transformation that took place. Isn't it extraordinary  That round of applause is actually for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of Avelile. And I take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation. So  I would like to say to you  each one in the audience  if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have access to good nutrition and good medical care  and you believe that the Millennium Development Goals  specifically five and six  should be absolutely committed to by all governments around the world    especially in sub Saharan Africa    could you please stand up. I think that's fair to say  it's almost everyone in the hall. Thank you very much. I am a Ph.D. student and that means I have a question  how can we make digital content graspable  Because you see  on the one hand  there is the digital world and no question  many things are happening there right now. And for us humans  it's not quite material  it's not really there    it's virtual. On the other hand  we humans  we live in a physical world. It's rich  it tastes good  it feels good  it smells good. So the question is  how do we get the stuff over from the digital into the physical  That's my question. If you look at the iPhone with its touch and the Wii with its bodily activity  you can see the tendency  it's getting physical. The question is  what's next  Now  I have three options that I would like to show you. The first one is mass. As humans  we are sensitive to where an object in our hand is heavy. So  could we use that in mobile phones  Let me show you the weight shifting mobile. It is a mobile phone shaped box that has an iron weight inside  which we can move around  and you can feel where it's heavy. We shift the gravitational center of it. For example  we can augment digital content with physical mass. So you move around the content on a display  but you can also feel where it is just from the weight of the device. Another thing it's good for is navigation    it can guide you around in a city. It can tell you by its weight   Okay  move right. Walk ahead. Make a left here.  And the good thing about that is you don't have to look at the device all the time  you have your eyes free to see the city. Now  mass is the first thing  the second thing  that's shape. We're also sensitive to the shape of objects we have in  our  hands. So if I download an e book and it has    pages    well  they could be thin  right    but if it has     pages  I want to feel that  Harry Potter     it's thick.  Laughter  So let me show you the shape changing mobile. Again  it's a mobile phone shaped box  and this one can change its shape. We can play with the shape itself. For example  it can be thin in your pocket  which we of course want it to be  but then if you hold it in your hand  it can lean towards you  be thick. It's like tapered to the downside. If you change the grasp  it can adjust to that. It's also useful if you want to put it down on your nightstand to watch a movie or use as an alarm clock  it stands. It's fairly simple. Another thing is  sometimes we watch things on a mobile phone  they are bigger than the phone itself. So in that case    like here  there's an app that's bigger than the phone's screen    the shape of the phone could tell you   Okay  off the screen right here  there is more content. You can't see it  but it's there.  And you can feel that because it's thicker at that edge. The shape is the second thing. The third thing operates on a different level. As humans  we are social  we are empathic  and that's great. Wouldn't that be a way to make mobile phones more intuitive  Think of a hamster in the pocket. Well  I can feel it  it's doing all right    I don't have to check it. Let me show you the living mobile phone. So  once again  mobile phone shaped box  but this one  it has a breath and a heartbeat  and it feels very organic. And you can tell  it's relaxed right now. Oh now  missed call  a new call  new girlfriend maybe    very exciting.  Laughter  How do we calm it down  You give it a pat behind the ears  and everything is all right again. So  that's very intuitive  and that's what we want. So  what we have seen are three ways to make the digital graspable for us. And I think making it physical is a good way to do that. What's behind that is a postulation  namely that not humans should get much more technical in the future  rather than that  technology  a bit more human. The Hindus say   Nada brahma   one translation of which is   The world is sound.  And in a way  that's true  because everything is vibrating. In fact  all of you as you sit here right now are vibrating. Every part of your body is vibrating at different frequencies. So you are  in fact  a chord    each of you an individual chord. One definition of health may be that that chord is in complete harmony. Your ears can't hear that chord  they can actually hear amazing things. Your ears can hear    octaves. Incidentally  we see just one octave. Your ears are always on    you have no ear lids. They work even when you sleep. The smallest sound you can perceive moves your eardrum just four atomic diameters. The loudest sound you can hear is a trillion times more powerful than that. Ears are made not for hearing  but for listening. Listening is an active skill  whereas hearing is passive  listening is something that we have to work at    it's a relationship with sound. And yet it's a skill that none of us are taught. For example  have you ever considered that there are listening positions  places you can listen from  Here are two of them. Reductive listening is listening  for.  It reduces everything down to what's relevant and it discards everything that's not relevant. Men typically listen reductively. So he's saying   I've got this problem.  He's saying   Here's your solution. Thanks very much. Next.  That's the way we talk  right guys  Expansive listening  on the other hand  is listening  with   not listening  for.  It's got no destination in mind    it's just enjoying the journey. Women typically listen expansively. If you look at these two  eye contact  facing each other  possibly both talking at the same time. Men  if you get nothing else out of this talk  practice expansive listening  and you can transform your relationships. The trouble with listening is that so much of what we hear is noise  surrounding us all the time. Noise like this  according to the European Union  is reducing the health and the quality of life of    percent of the population of Europe. Two percent of the population of Europe    that's    million people    are having their sleep devastated by noise like that. Noise kills         people a year in Europe. It's a really big problem. Now  when you were little  if you had noise and you didn't want to hear it  you'd stick your fingers in your ears and hum. These days  you can do a similar thing  it just looks a bit cooler. It looks a bit like this. The trouble with widespread headphone use is it brings three really big health issues. The first really big health issue is a word that Murray Schafer coined   schizophonia.  It's a dislocation between what you see and what you hear. So  we're inviting into our lives the voices of people who are not present with us. I think there's something deeply unhealthy about living all the time in schizophonia. The second problem that comes with headphone abuse is compression. We squash music to fit it into our pocket and there is a cost attached to this. Listen to this    this is an uncompressed piece of music. And now the same piece of music with    percent of the data removed. I do hope that some of you at least can hear the difference between those two. There is a cost of compression. It makes you tired and irritable to have to make up all of that data. You're having to imagine it. It's not good for you in the long run. The third problem with headphones is this  deafness    noise induced hearing disorder. Ten million Americans already have this for one reason or another  but really worryingly     percent    roughly one in six    of American teenagers suffer from noise induced hearing disorder as a result of headphone abuse. One study at an American university found that    percent of college freshmen had damaged hearing as a result of headphone abuse. We may be raising an entire generation of deaf people. Now that's a really serious problem. I'll give you three quick tips to protect your ears and pass these on to your children  please. Professional hearing protectors are great  I use some all the time. If you're going to use headphones  buy the best ones you can afford because quality means you don't have to have it so loud. If you can't hear somebody talking to you in a loud voice  it's too loud. And thirdly  if you're in bad sound  it's fine to put your fingers in your ears or just move away from it. Protect your ears in that way. Let's move away from bad sound and look at some friends that I urge you to seek out. WWB  Wind  water  birds    stochastic natural sounds composed of lots of individual random events  all of it very healthy  all of it sound that we evolved to over the years. Seek those sounds out  they're good for you and so it this. Silence is beautiful. The Elizabethans described language as decorated silence. I urge you to move away from silence with intention and to design soundscapes just like works of art. Have a foreground  a background  all in beautiful proportion. It's fun to get into designing with sound. If you can't do it yourself  get a professional to do it for you. Sound design is the future  and I think it's the way we're going to change the way the world sounds. I'm going to just run quickly through eight modalities  eight ways sound can improve health. First  ultrasound  we're very familiar with it from physical therapy  it's also now being used to treat cancer. Lithotripsy    saving thousands of people a year from the scalpel by pulverizing stones with high intensity sound. Sound healing is a wonderful modality. It's been around for thousands of years. I do urge you to explore this. There are great things being done there  treating now autism  dementia and other conditions. And music  of course. Just listening to music is good for you  if it's music that's made with good intention  made with love  generally. Devotional music  good    Mozart  good. There are all sorts of types of music that are very healthy. And four modalities where you need to take some action and get involved. First of all  listen consciously. I hope that that after this talk you'll be doing that. It's a whole new dimension to your life and it's wonderful to have that dimension. Secondly  get in touch with making some sound    create sound. The voice is the instrument we all play  and yet how many of us are trained in using our voice  Get trained  learn to sing  learn to play an instrument. Musicians have bigger brains    it's true. You can do this in groups as well. It's a fantastic antidote to schizophonia  to make music and sound in a group of people  whichever style you enjoy particularly. And let's take a stewarding role for the sound around us. Protect your ears  Yes  absolutely. Design soundscapes to be beautiful around you at home and at work. And let's start to speak up when people are assailing us with the noise that I played you early on. So I'm going to leave you with seven things you can do right now to improve your health with sound. My vision is of a world that sounds beautiful and if we all start doing these things  we will take a very big step in that direction. So I urge you to take that path. I'm leaving you with a little more birdsong  which is very good for you. I wish you sound health. I got up this morning at      a.m. after going to sleep at       a.m. I was awakened once during the night. My heart rate was    beats per minute    my blood pressure      over   . I had zero minutes of exercise yesterday  so my maximum heart rate during exercise wasn't calculated. I had about     milligrams of caffeine  zero of alcohol. And my score on the Narcissism Personality Index  or the NPI     is a reassuring  .  . We know that numbers are useful for us when we advertise  manage  govern  search. I'm going to talk about how they're useful when we reflect  learn  remember and want to improve. A few years ago  Kevin Kelly  my partner  and I noticed that people were subjecting themselves to regimes of quantitative measurement and self tracking that went far beyond the ordinary  familiar habits such as stepping on a scale every day. People were tracking their food via Twitter  their kids' diapers on their iPhone. They were making detailed journals of their spending  their mood  their symptoms  their treatments. Now  we know some of the technological facts that are driving this change in our lifestyle    the uptake and diffusion of mobile devices  the exponential improvement in data storage and data processing  and the remarkable improvement in human biometric sensors. This little black dot there is a  D accelerometer. It tracks your movement through space. It is  as you can see  very small and also very cheap. They're now down to well under a dollar a piece  and they're going into all kinds of devices. But what's interesting is the incredible detailed information that you can get from just one sensor like this. This kind of sensor is in the hit biometric device    among early adopters at the moment    the Fitbit. This tracks your activity and also your sleep. It has just that sensor in it. You're probably familiar with the Nike  system. I just put it up because that little blue dot is the sensor. It's really just a pressure sensor like the kind that's in a doorbell. And Nike knows how to get your pace and distance from just that sensor. This is the strap that people use to transmit heart rate data to their Nike  system. This is a beautiful  new device that gives you detailed sleep tracking data  not just whether you're asleep or awake  but also your phase of sleep    deep sleep  light sleep  REM sleep. The sensor is just a little strip of metal in that headband there. The rest of it is the bedside console  just for reference  this is a sleep tracking system from just a few years ago    I mean  really until now. And this is the sleep tracking system of today. This just was presented at a health care conference in D.C. Most of what you see there is an asthma inhaler  but the top is a very small GPS transceiver  which gives you the date and location of an asthma incident  giving you a new awareness of your vulnerability in relation to time and environmental factors. Now  we know that new tools are changing our sense of self in the world    these tiny sensors that gather data in nature  the ubiquitous computing that allows that data to be understood and used  and of course the social networks that allow people to collaborate and contribute. But we think of these tools as pointing outward  as windows and I'd just like to invite you to think of them as also turning inward and becoming mirrors. So that when we think about using them to get some systematic improvement  we also think about how they can be useful for self improvement  for self discovery  self awareness  self knowledge. Here's a biometric device  a pair of Apple Earbuds. Last year  Apple filed some patents to get blood oxygenation  heart rate and body temperature via the Earbuds. What is this for  What should it be for  Some people will say it's for biometric security. Some people will say it's for public health research. Some people will say it's for avant garde marketing research. I'd like to tell you that it's also for self knowledge. And the self isn't the only thing  it's not even most things. The self is just our operation center  our consciousness  our moral compass. So  if we want to act more effectively in the world  we have to get to know ourselves better. Thank you. We live in in a remarkable time  the age of genomics. Your genome is the entire sequence of your DNA. Your sequence and mine are slightly different. That's why we look different. I've got brown eyes  you might have blue or gray. But it's not just skin deep. The headlines tell us that genes can give us scary diseases  maybe even shape our personality  or give us mental disorders. Our genes seem to have awesome power over our destinies. And yet  I would like to think that I am more than my genes. What do you guys think  Are you more than your genes  I think some people agree with me. I think we should make a statement. I think we should say it all together. All right   I'm more than my genes     all together. Everybody  I am more than my genes. Sebastian Seung  What am I  I am my connectome. Now  since you guys are really great  maybe you can humor me and say this all together too. Right. All together now. Everybody  I am my connectome. SS  That sounded great. You know  you guys are so great  you don't even know what a connectome is  and you're willing to play along with me. I could just go home now. Well  so far only one connectome is known  that of this tiny worm. Its modest nervous system consists of just     neurons. And in the     s and '  s  a team of scientists mapped all       connections between the neurons. In this diagram  every node is a neuron  and every line is a connection. This is the connectome of the worm C. elegans. Your connectome is far more complex than this because your brain contains     billion neurons and        times as many connections. There's a diagram like this for your brain  but there's no way it would fit on this slide. Your connectome contains one million times more connections than your genome has letters. That's a lot of information. What's in that information  We don't know for sure  but there are theories. Since the   th century  neuroscientists have speculated that maybe your memories    the information that makes you  you    maybe your memories are stored in the connections between your brain's neurons. And perhaps other aspects of your personal identity    maybe your personality and your intellect    maybe they're also encoded in the connections between your neurons. And so now you can see why I proposed this hypothesis  I am my connectome. I didn't ask you to chant it because it's true  I just want you to remember it. And in fact  we don't know if this hypothesis is correct  because we have never had technologies powerful enough to test it. Finding that worm connectome took over a dozen years of tedious labor. And to find the connectomes of brains more like our own  we need more sophisticated technologies  that are automated  that will speed up the process of finding connectomes. And in the next few minutes  I'll tell you about some of these technologies  which are currently under development in my lab and the labs of my collaborators. Now you've probably seen pictures of neurons before. You can recognize them instantly by their fantastic shapes. They extend long and delicate branches  and in short  they look like trees. But this is just a single neuron. In order to find connectomes  we have to see all the neurons at the same time. So let's meet Bobby Kasthuri  who works in the laboratory of Jeff Lichtman at Harvard University. Bobby is holding fantastically thin slices of a mouse brain. And we're zooming in by a factor of         times to obtain the resolution  so that we can see the branches of neurons all at the same time. Except  you still may not really recognize them  and that's because we have to work in three dimensions. If we take many images of many slices of the brain and stack them up  we get a three dimensional image. And still  you may not see the branches. So we start at the top  and we color in the cross section of one branch in red  and we do that for the next slice and for the next slice. And we keep on doing that  slice after slice. If we continue through the entire stack  we can reconstruct the three dimensional shape of a small fragment of a branch of a neuron. And we can do that for another neuron in green. And you can see that the green neuron touches the red neuron at two locations  and these are what are called synapses. Let's zoom in on one synapse  and keep your eyes on the interior of the green neuron. You should see small circles    these are called vesicles. They contain a molecule know as a neurotransmitter. And so when the green neuron wants to communicate  it wants to send a message to the red neuron  it spits out neurotransmitter. At the synapse  the two neurons are said to be connected like two friends talking on the telephone. So you see how to find a synapse. How can we find an entire connectome  Well  we take this three dimensional stack of images and treat it as a gigantic three dimensional coloring book. We color every neuron in  in a different color  and then we look through all of the images  find the synapses and note the colors of the two neurons involved in each synapse. If we can do that throughout all the images  we could find a connectome. Now  at this point  you've learned the basics of neurons and synapses. And so I think we're ready to tackle one of the most important questions in neuroscience  how are the brains of men and women different  According to this self help book  guys brains are like waffles  they keep their lives compartmentalized in boxes. Girls' brains are like spaghetti  everything in their life is connected to everything else. You guys are laughing  but you know  this book changed my life. But seriously  what's wrong with this  You already know enough to tell me    what's wrong with this statement  It doesn't matter whether you're a guy or girl  everyone's brains are like spaghetti. Or maybe really  really fine capellini with branches. Just as one strand of spaghetti contacts many other strands on your plate  one neuron touches many other neurons through their entangled branches. One neuron can be connected to so many other neurons  because there can be synapses at these points of contact. By now  you might have sort of lost perspective on how large this cube of brain tissue actually is. And so let's do a series of comparisons to show you. I assure you  this is very tiny. It's just six microns on a side. So  here's how it stacks up against an entire neuron. And you can tell that  really  only the smallest fragments of branches are contained inside this cube. And a neuron  well  that's smaller than brain. And that's just a mouse brain    it's a lot smaller than a human brain. So when show my friends this  sometimes they've told me   You know  Sebastian  you should just give up. Neuroscience is hopeless.  Because if you look at a brain with your naked eye  you don't really see how complex it is  but when you use a microscope  finally the hidden complexity is revealed. In the   th century  the mathematician and philosopher  Blaise Pascal  wrote of his dread of the infinite  his feeling of insignificance at contemplating the vast reaches of outer space. And  as a scientist  I'm not supposed to talk about my feelings    too much information  professor. But may I  I feel curiosity  and I feel wonder  but at times I have also felt despair. Why did I choose to study this organ that is so awesome in its complexity that it might well be infinite  It's absurd. How could we even dare to think that we might ever understand this  And yet  I persist in this quixotic endeavor. And indeed  these days I harbor new hopes. Someday  a fleet of microscopes will capture every neuron and every synapse in a vast database of images. And some day  artificially intelligent supercomputers will analyze the images without human assistance to summarize them in a connectome. I do not know  but I hope that I will live to see that day  because finding an entire human connectome is one of the greatest technological challenges of all time. It will take the work of generations to succeed. At the present time  my collaborators and I  what we're aiming for is much more modest    just to find partial connectomes of tiny chunks of mouse and human brain. But even that will be enough for the first tests of this hypothesis that I am my connectome. For now  let me try to convince you of the plausibility of this hypothesis  that it's actually worth taking seriously. As you grow during childhood and age during adulthood  your personal identity changes slowly. Likewise  every connectome changes over time. What kinds of changes happen  Well  neurons  like trees  can grow new branches  and they can lose old ones. Synapses can be created  and they can be eliminated. And synapses can grow larger  and they can grow smaller. Second question  what causes these changes  Well  it's true. To some extent  they are programmed by your genes. But that's not the whole story  because there are signals  electrical signals  that travel along the branches of neurons and chemical signals that jump across from branch to branch. These signals are called neural activity. And there's a lot of evidence that neural activity is encoding our thoughts  feelings and perceptions  our mental experiences. And there's a lot of evidence that neural activity can cause your connections to change. And if you put those two facts together  it means that your experiences can change your connectome. And that's why every connectome is unique  even those of genetically identical twins. The connectome is where nature meets nurture. And it might true that just the mere act of thinking can change your connectome    an idea that you may find empowering. What's in this picture  A cool and refreshing stream of water  you say. What else is in this picture  Do not forget that groove in the Earth called the stream bed. Without it  the water would not know in which direction to flow. And with the stream  I would like to propose a metaphor for the relationship between neural activity and connectivity. Neural activity is constantly changing. It's like the water of the stream  it never sits still. The connections of the brain's neural network determines the pathways along which neural activity flows. And so the connectome is like bed of the stream  but the metaphor is richer than that  because it's true that the stream bed guides the flow of the water  but over long timescales  the water also reshapes the bed of the stream. And as I told you just now  neural activity can change the connectome. And if you'll allow me to ascend to metaphorical heights  I will remind you that neural activity is the physical basis    or so neuroscientists think    of thoughts  feelings and perceptions. And so we might even speak of the stream of consciousness. Neural activity is its water  and the connectome is its bed. So let's return from the heights of metaphor and return to science. Suppose our technologies for finding connectomes actually work. How will we go about testing the hypothesis  I am my connectome   Well  I propose a direct test. Let us attempt to read out memories from connectomes. Consider the memory of long temporal sequences of movements  like a pianist playing a Beethoven sonata. According to a theory that dates back to the   th century  such memories are stored as chains of synaptic connections inside your brain. Because  if the first neurons in the chain are activated  through their synapses they send messages to the second neurons  which are activated  and so on down the line  like a chain of falling dominoes. And this sequence of neural activation is hypothesized to be the neural basis of those sequence of movements. So one way of trying to test the theory is to look for such chains inside connectomes. But it won't be easy  because they're not going to look like this. They're going to be scrambled up. So we'll have to use our computers to try to unscramble the chain. And if we can do that  the sequence of the neurons we recover from that unscrambling will be a prediction of the pattern of neural activity that is replayed in the brain during memory recall. And if that were successful  that would be the first example of reading a memory from a connectome. What a mess    have you ever tried to wire up a system as complex as this  I hope not. But if you have  you know it's very easy to make a mistake. The branches of neurons are like the wires of the brain. Can anyone guess  what's the total length of wires in your brain  I'll give you a hint. It's a big number. I estimate  millions of miles  all packed in your skull. And if you appreciate that number  you can easily see there is huge potential for mis wiring of the brain. And indeed  the popular press loves headlines like   Anorexic brains are wired differently   or  Autistic brains are wired differently.  These are plausible claims  but in truth  we can't see the brain's wiring clearly enough to tell if these are really true. And so the technologies for seeing connectomes will allow us to finally read mis wiring of the brain  to see mental disorders in connectomes. Sometimes the best way to test a hypothesis is to consider its most extreme implication. Philosophers know this game very well. If you believe that I am my connectome  I think you must also accept the idea that death is the destruction of your connectome. I mention this because there are prophets today who claim that technology will fundamentally alter the human condition and perhaps even transform the human species. One of their most cherished dreams is to cheat death by that practice known as cryonics. If you pay         dollars  you can arrange to have your body frozen after death and stored in liquid nitrogen in one of these tanks in an Arizona warehouse  awaiting a future civilization that is advanced to resurrect you. Should we ridicule the modern seekers of immortality  calling them fools  Or will they someday chuckle over our graves  I don't know    I prefer to test their beliefs  scientifically. I propose that we attempt to find a connectome of a frozen brain. We know that damage to the brain occurs after death and during freezing. The question is  has that damage erased the connectome  If it has  there is no way that any future civilization will be able to recover the memories of these frozen brains. Resurrection might succeed for the body  but not for the mind. On the other hand  if the connectome is still intact  we cannot ridicule the claims of cryonics so easily. I've described a quest that begins in the world of the very small  and propels us to the world of the far future. Connectomes will mark a turning point in human history. As we evolved from our ape like ancestors on the African savanna  what distinguished us was our larger brains. We have used our brains to fashion ever more amazing technologies. Eventually  these technologies will become so powerful that we will use them to know ourselves by deconstructing and reconstructing our own brains. I believe that this voyage of self discovery is not just for scientists  but for all of us. And I'm grateful for the opportunity to share this voyage with you today. Thank you. So I want to tell you a story    an encouraging story    about addressing desperation  depression and despair in Afghanistan  and what we have learned from it  and how to help people to overcome traumatic experiences and how to help them to regain some confidence in the time ahead    in the future    and how to participate again in everyday life. So  I am a Jungian psychoanalyst  and I went to Afghanistan in January       by chance  on an assignment for Medica Mondiale. Jung in Afghanistan    you get the picture. Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world  and    percent of the people are illiterate. War and malnutrition kills people together with hope. You may know this from the media  but what you may not know is that the average age of the Afghan people is    years old  which means they grow up in such an environment and    I repeat myself    in    years of war. So this translates into ongoing violence  foreign interests  bribery  drugs  ethnic conflicts  bad health  shame  fear and cumulative traumatic experiences. Local and foreign military are supposed to build peace together with the donors and the governmental and non governmental organizations. And people had hope  yes  but until they realized their situation worsens every day    either because they are being killed or because  somehow  they are poorer than eight years ago. One figure for that     percent of the children under the age of five years suffer from malnutrition. Yet  there is hope. One day a man told me   My future does not look brilliant  but I want to have a brilliant future for my son.  This is a picture I took in       walking on Fridays over the hills in Kabul  and for me it's a symbolic picture of an open future for a young generation. So  doctors prescribe medication. And donors are supposed to bring peace by building schools and roads. Military collect weapons  and depression stays intact. Why  Because people don't have tools to cope with it  to get over it. So  soon after my arrival  I had confirmed something which I had already known  that my instruments come from the heart of modern Europe  yes. However  what can wound us and our reaction to those wounds    they are universal. And the big challenge was how to understand the meaning of the symptom in this specific cultural context. After a counseling session  a woman said to me   Because you have felt me  I can feel myself again  and I want to participate again in my family life.  This was very important  because the family is central in Afghans' social system. No one can survive alone. And if people feel used  worthless and ashamed  because something horrible has happened to them  then they retreat  and they fall into social isolation  and they do not dare to tell this evil to other people or to their loved ones  because they do not want to burden them. And very often violence is a way to cope with it. Traumatized people also easily lose control    symptoms are hyper arousal and memory flashbacks    so people are in a constant fear that those horrible feelings of that traumatic event might come back unexpectedly  suddenly  and they cannot control it. To compensate this loss of inner control  they try to control the outside  very understandably    mostly the family    and unfortunately  this fits very well into the traditional side  regressive side  repressive side  restrictive side of the cultural context. So  husbands start beating wives  mothers and fathers beat their children  and afterward  they feel awful. They did not want to do this  it just happened    they lost control. The desperate try to restore order and normality  and if we are not able to cut this circle of violence  it will be transferred to the next generation without a doubt. And partly this is already happening. So everybody needs a sense for the future  and the Afghan sense of the future is shattered. But let me repeat the words of the woman.  Because you have felt me  I can feel myself again.  So the key here is empathy. Somebody has to be a witness to what has happened to you. Somebody has to feel how you felt. And somebody has to see you and listen to you. Everybody must be able to know what he or she has experienced is true  and this only goes with another person. So everybody must be able to say   This happened to me  and it did this with me  but I'm able to live with it  to cope with it  and to learn from it. And I want to engage myself in the bright future for my children and the children of my children  and I will not marry off my    year old daughter      what happens too often in Afghanistan. So something can be done  even in such extreme environments as Afghanistan. And I started thinking about a counseling program. But  of course  I needed help and funds. And one evening  I was sitting next to a very nice gentleman in Kabul  and he asked what I thought would be good in Afghanistan. And I explained to him quickly  I would train psycho social counselors  I would open centers  and I explained to him why. This man gave me his contact details at the end of the evening and said   If you want to do this  call me.  At that time  it was the head of Caritas Germany. So  I was able to launch a three year project with Caritas Germany  and we trained    Afghan women and men  and we opened    counseling centers in Kabul. This was our sign    it's hand painted  and we had    all over Kabul. Eleven thousand people came    more than that. And    percent regained their lives. This was a very exciting time  developing this with my wonderful Afghan team. And they are working with me up to today. We developed a culturally sensitive psycho social counseling approach. So  from      up until today  a substantial change and step forward has been taking place. The European Union delegation in Kabul came into this and hired me to work inside the Ministry of Public Health  to lobby this approach    we succeeded. We revised the mental health component of the primary health care services by adding psycho social care and psycho social counselors to the system. This means  certainly  to retrain all health staff. But for that  we already have the training manuals  which are approved by the Ministry and moreover  this approach is now part of the mental health strategy in Afghanistan. So we also have implemented it already in some selected clinics in three provinces  and you are the first to see the results. We wanted to know if what is being done is effective. And here you can see the patients all had symptoms of depression  moderate and severe. And the red line is the treatment as usual    medication with a medical doctor. And all the symptoms stayed the same or even got worse. And the green line is treatment with psycho social counseling only  without medication. And you can see the symptoms almost completely go away  and the psycho social stress has dropped significantly  which is explicable  because you cannot take away the psycho social stresses  but you can learn how to cope with them. So this makes us very happy  because now we also have some evidence that this is working. So here you see  this is a health facility in Northern Afghanistan  and every morning it looks like this all over. And doctors usually have three to six minutes for the patients  but now this will change. They go to the clinics  because they want to cure their immediate symptoms  and they will find somebody to talk to and discuss these issues and talk about what is burdening them and find solutions  develop their resources  learn tools to solve their family conflicts and gain some confidence in the future. And I would like to share one short vignette. One Hazara said to his Pashtun counselor   If we were to have met some years ago  then we would have killed each other. And now you are helping me to regain some confidence in the future.  And another counselor said to me after the training   You know  I never knew why I survived the killings in my village  but now I know  because I am part of a nucleus of a new peaceful society in Afghanistan.  So I believe this kept me running. And this is a really emancipatory and political contribution to peace and reconciliation. And also    I think    without psycho social therapy  and without considering this in all humanitarian projects  we cannot build up civil societies. I thought it was an idea worth spreading  and I think it must be  can be  could be replicated elsewhere. I thank you for your attention. Welcome to Thailand. Now  when I was a young man       years ago  the country was very  very poor with lots and lots and lots of people living in poverty. We decided to do something about it  but we didn't begin with a welfare program or a poverty reduction program. But we began with a family planning program  following a very successful maternal child health activity  sets of activities. So basically  no one would accept family planning if their children didn't survive. So the first step  get to the children  get to the mothers  and then follow up with family planning. Not just child mortality alone  you need also family planning. Now let me take you back as to why we needed to do it. In my country  that was the case in     . Seven children per family    tremendous growth at  .  percent. There was just no future. We needed to reduce the population growth rate. So we said   Let's do it.  The women said   We agree. We'll use pills  but we need a doctor to prescribe the pills   and we had very  very few doctors. We didn't take no as an answer  we took no as a question. We went to the nurses and the midwives  who were also women  and did a fantastic job at explaining how to use the pill. That was wonderful  but it covered only    percent of the country. What do we do for the other    percent    leave them alone and say   Well  they're not medical personnel.  No  we decided to do a bit more. So we went to the ordinary people that you saw. Actually  below that yellow sign    I wish they hadn't wiped that  because there was  Coca Cola  there. We were so much bigger than Coca Cola in those days. And no difference  the people they chose were the people we chose. They were well known in the community  they knew that customers were always right  and they were terrific  and they practiced their family planning themselves. So they could supply pills and condoms throughout the country  in every village of the country. So there we are. We went to the people who were seen as the cause of the problem to be the solution. Wherever there were people    and you can see boats with the women  selling things    here's the floating market selling bananas and crabs and also contraceptives    wherever you find people  you'll find contraceptives in Thailand. And then we decided  why not get to religion because in the Philippines  the Catholic Church was pretty strong  and Thai people were Buddhist. We went to them and they said   Look  could you help us   I'm there    the one in blue  not the yellow    holding a bowl of holy water for the monk to sprinkle holy water on pills and condoms for the sanctity of the family. And this picture was sent throughout the country. So some of the monks in the villages were doing the same thing themselves. And the women were saying   No wonder we have no side effects. It's been blessed.  That was their perception. And then we went to teachers. You need everybody to be involved in trying to provide whatever it is that make humanity a better place. So we went to the teachers. Over a quarter of a million were taught about family planning with a new alphabet    A  B for birth  C for condom  I for IUD  V for vasectomy. And then we had a snakes and ladders game  where you throw dice. If you land on anything pro family planning  you move ahead. Like   Mother takes the pill every night. Very good  mother. Move ahead. Uncle buys a condom. Very good  uncle. Move ahead. Uncle gets drunk  doesn't use condom. Come back  start again.  Again  education  class entertainment. And the kids were doing it in school too. We had relay races with condoms  we had children's condom blowing championship. And before long  the condom was know as the girl's best friend. In Thailand  for poor people  diamonds don't make it    so the condom is the girl's best friend. We introduced our first microcredit program in       and the women who organized it said   We only want to lend to women who practice family planning. If you're pregnant  take care of your pregnancy. If you're not pregnant  you can take a loan out from us.  And that was run by them. And after       years  it's still going on. It's a part of the Village Development Bank  it's not a real bank  but it's a fund    microcredit. And we didn't need a big organization to run it    it was run by the villagers themselves. And you probably hardly see a Thai man there  it's always women  women  women  women. And then we thought we'd help America  because America's been helping everyone  whether they want help or not. And this is on the Fourth of July. We decided to provide vasectomy to all men  but in particular  American men to the front of the queue  right up to the Ambassador's residence during his  unclear . And the hotel gave us the ballroom for it    very appropriate room. And since it was near lunch time  they said   All right  we'll give you some lunch. Of course  it must be American cola. You get two brands  Coke and Pepsi. And then the food is either hamburger or hotdog.  And I thought a hotdog will be more symbolic. And here is this  then  young man called Willy Bohm who worked for the USAID. Obviously  he's had his vasectomy because his hotdog is half eaten  and he was very happy. It made a lot of news in America  and it angered some people also. I said   Don't worry. Come over and I'll do the whole lot of you.  And what happened  In all this thing  from seven children to  .  children  population growth rate of  .  to  . . You could call it the Coca Cola approach if you like    it was exactly the same thing. I'm not sure whether Coca Cola followed us  or we followed Coca Cola  but we're good friends. And so that's the case of everyone joining in. We didn't have a strong government. We didn't have lots of doctors. But it's everybody's job who can change attitude and behavior. Then AIDS came along and hit Thailand  and we had to stop doing a lot of good things to fight AIDS. But unfortunately  the government was in denial  denial  denial. So our work wasn't affected. So I thought   Well  if you can't go to the government  go to the military.  So I went to the military and asked to borrow     radio stations. They have more than the government  and they've got more guns than the government. So I asked them  could they help us in our fight against HIV. And after I gave them statistics  they said   Yes. Okay. You can use all the radio stations  television stations.  And that's when we went onto the airwaves. And then we got a new prime minister soon after that. And he said   Mechai  could you come and join   He asked me in because he liked my wife a lot. So I said   Okay.  He became the chairman of the National AIDS Committee and increased the budget fifty fold. Every ministry  even judges  had to be involved in AIDS education    everyone    and we said the public  institutions  religious institutions  schools    everyone was involved. And here  every media person had to be trained for HIV. And we gave every station half a minute extra for advertising to earn more money. So they were happy with that. And then AIDS education in all schools  starting from university. And these are high school kids teaching high school kids. And the best teachers were the girls  not the boys  and they were terrific. And these girls who go around teaching about safe sex and HIV were known as Mother Theresa. And then we went down one more step. These are primary school kids    third  fourth grade    going to every household in the village  every household in the whole of Thailand  giving AIDS information and a condom to every household  given by these young kids. And no parents objected  because we were trying to save lives  and this was a lifesaver. And we said   Everyone needs to be involved.  So you have the companies also realizing that sick staff don't work  and dead customers don't buy. So they all trained. And then we have this Captain Condom  with his Harvard MBA  going to schools and night spots. And they loved him. You need a symbol of something. In every country  every program  you need a symbol  and this is probably the best thing he's ever done with his MBA. And then we gave condoms out everywhere on the streets    everywhere  everywhere. In taxis  you get condoms. And also  in traffic  the policemen give you condoms    our  cops and rubbers  programs. So  can you imagine New York policemen giving out condoms  Of course I can. And they'd enjoy it immensely  I see them standing around right now  everywhere. Imagine if they had condoms  giving out to all sorts of people. And then  new change  we had hair bands  clothing and the condom for your mobile phone during the rainy season. And these were the condoms that we introduced. One says   Weapon of mass protection.  We found    you know    somebody here was searching for the weapon of mass destruction  but we have found the weapon of mass protection  the condom. And then it says here  with the American flag   Don't leave home without it.  But I have some to give out afterward. But let me warn you  these are Thai sized  so be very careful. And so you can see that condoms can do so many things. Look at this    I gave this to Al Gore and to Bill Senior also. Stop global warming  use condoms. And then this is the picture I mentioned to you    the weapon of mass protection. And let the next Olympics save some lives. Why just run around  And then finally  in Thailand we're Buddhist  we don't have a God  so instead  we say   In rubber we trust.  So you can see that we added everything to our endeavor to make life better for the people. We had condoms in all the refrigerators in the hotels and the schools  because alcohol impairs judgment. And then what happened  After all this time  everybody joined in. According to the U.N.  new cases of HIV declined by    percent  and according to the World Bank   .  million lives were saved. Otherwise there wouldn't be many Thais walking around today. So it just showed you  you could do something about it.    percent of the funding came from Thailand. There was political commitment  some financial commitment  and everybody joined in the fight. So just don't leave it to the specialists and doctors and nurses. We all need to help. And then we decided to help people out of poverty  now that we got AIDS somewhat out of the way    this time  not with government alone  but in cooperation with the business community. Because poor people are business people who lack business skills and access to credit. Those are the things to be provided by the business community. We're trying to turn them into barefoot entrepreneurs  little business people. The only way out of poverty is through business enterprise. So  that was done. The money goes from the company into the village via tree planting. It's not a free gift. They plant the trees  and the money goes into their microcredit fund  which we call the Village Development Bank. Everybody joins in  and they feel they own the bank  because they have brought the money in. And before you can borrow the money  you need to be trained. And we believe if you want to help the poor  those who are living in poverty  access to credit must be a human right. Access to credit must be a human right. Otherwise they'll never get out of poverty. And then before getting a loan  you must be trained. Here's what we call a  barefoot MBA   teaching people how to do business so that  when they borrow money  they'll succeed with the business. These are some of the businesses  mushrooms  crabs  vegetables  trees  fruits  and this is very interesting    Nike ice cream and Nike biscuits  this is a village sponsored by Nike. They said   They should stop making shoes and clothes. Make these better  because we can afford them.  And then we have silk  Thai silk. Now we're making Scottish tartans  as you can see on the left  to sell to all people of Scottish ancestors. So anyone sitting in and watching TV  get in touch with me. And then this is our answer to Starbucks in Thailand     Coffee and Condoms.  See  Starbucks you awake  we keep you awake and alive. That's the difference. Can you imagine  at every Starbucks that you can also get condoms  You can order your condoms with your with your cappuccino. And then now  finally in education  we want to change the school as being underutilized into a place where it's a lifelong learning center for everyone. We call this our School Based Integrated Rural Development. And it's a center  a focal point for economic and social development. Re do the school  make it serve the community needs. And here is a bamboo building    all of them are bamboo. This is a geodesic dome made of bamboo. And I'm sure Buckminster Fuller would be very  very proud to see a bamboo geodesic dome. And we use vegetables around the school ground  so they raise their own vegetables. And then  finally  I firmly believe  if we want the MDGs to work    the Millennium Development Goals    we need to add family planning to it. Of course  child mortality first and then family planning    everyone needs family planning service    it's underutilized. So we have now found the weapon of mass protection. And we also ask the next Olympics to be involved in saving lives. And then  finally  that is our network. And these are our Thai tulips. Thank you very much indeed. So  I'd like to spend a few minutes with you folks today imagining what our planet might look like in a thousand years. But before I do that  I need to talk to you about synthetic materials like plastics  which require huge amounts of energy to create and  because of their disposal issues  are slowly poisoning our planet. I also want to tell you and share with you how my team and I have been using mushrooms over the last three years. Not like that.  Laughter  We're using mushrooms to create an entirely new class of materials  which perform a lot like plastics during their use  but are made from crop waste and are totally compostable at the end of their lives. But first  I need to talk to you about what I consider one of the most egregious offenders in the disposable plastics category. This is a material you all know is Styrofoam  but I like to think of it as toxic white stuff. In a single cubic foot of this material    about what would come around your computer or large television    you have the same energy content of about a liter and a half of petrol. Yet  after just a few weeks of use  you'll throw this material in the trash. And this isn't just found in packaging.    billion dollars of this material is produced every year  in everything from building materials to surfboards to coffee cups to table tops. And that's not the only place it's found. The EPA estimates  in the United States  by volume  this material occupies    percent of our landfills. Even worse is when it finds its way into our natural environment    on the side of the road or next to a river. If it's not picked up by a human  like me and you  it'll stay there for thousands and thousands of years. Perhaps even worse is when it finds its way into our oceans  like in the great plastic gyre  where these materials are being mechanically broken into smaller and smaller bits  but they're not really going away. They're not biologically compatible. They're basically fouling up Earth's respiratory and circulatory systems. And because these materials are so prolific  because they're found in so many places  there's one other place you'll find this material  styrene  which is made from benzene  a known carcinogen. You'll find it inside of you. So  for all these reasons  I think we need better materials  and there are three key principles we can use to guide these materials. The first is feedstocks. Today  we use a single feedstock  petroleum  to heat our homes  power our cars and make most of the materials you see around you. We recognize this is a finite resource  and it's simply crazy to do this  to put a liter and a half of petrol in the trash every time you get a package. Second of all  we should really strive to use far less energy in creating these materials. I say far less  because    percent isn't going to cut it. We should be talking about half  a quarter  one tenth the energy content. And lastly  and I think perhaps most importantly  we should be creating materials that fit into what I call nature's recycling system. This recycling system has been in place for the last billion years. I fit into it  you fit into it  and a hundred years tops  my body can return to the Earth with no preprocessing. Yet that packaging I got in the mail yesterday is going to last for thousands of years. This is crazy. But nature provides us with a really good model here. When a tree's done using its leaves    its solar collectors  these amazing molecular photon capturing devices    at the end of a season  it doesn't pack them up  take them to the leaf reprocessing center and have them melted down to form new leaves. It just drops them  the shortest distance possible  to the forest floor  where they're actually upcycled into next year's topsoil. And this gets us back to the mushrooms. Because in nature  mushrooms are the recycling system. And what we've discovered is  by using a part of the mushroom you've probably never seen    analogous to its root structure  it's called mycelium    we can actually grow materials with many of the same properties of conventional synthetics. Now  mycelium is an amazing material  because it's a self assembling material. It actually takes things we would consider waste    things like seed husks or woody biomass    and can transform them into a chitinous polymer  which you can form into almost any shape. In our process  we basically use it as a glue. And by using mycelium as a glue  you can mold things just like you do in the plastic industry  and you can create materials with many different properties  materials that are insulating  fire resistant  moisture resistant  vapor resistant    materials that can absorb impacts  that can absorb acoustical impacts. But these materials are grown from agricultural byproducts  not petroleum. And because they're made of natural materials  they are     percent compostable in you own backyard. So I'd like to share with you the four basic steps required to make these materials. The first is selecting a feedstock  preferably something that's regional  that's in your area  right    local manufacturing. The next is actually taking this feedstock and putting in a tool  physically filling an enclosure  a mold  in whatever shape you want to get. Then you actually grow the mycelium through these particles  and that's where the magic happens  because the organism is doing the work in this process  not the equipment. The final step is  of course  the product  whether it's a packaging material  a table top  or building block. Our vision is local manufacturing  like the local food movement  for production. So we've created formulations for all around the world using regional byproducts. If you're in China  you might use a rice husk or a cottonseed hull. If you're in Northern Europe or North America  you can use things like buckwheat husks or oat hulls. We then process these husks with some basic equipment. And I want to share with you a quick video from our facility that gives you a sense of how this looks at scale. So what you're seeing here is actually cotton hulls from Texas  in this case. It's a waste product. And what they're doing in our equipment is going through a continuous system  which cleans  cooks  cools and pasteurizes these materials  while also continuously inoculating them with our mycelium. This gives us a continuous stream of material that we can put into almost any shape  though today we're making corner blocks. And it's when this lid goes on the part  that the magic really starts. Because the manufacturing process is our organism. It'll actually begin to digest these wastes and  over the next five days  assemble them into biocomposites. Our entire facility is comprised of thousands and thousands and thousands of these tools sitting indoors in the dark  quietly self assembling materials    and everything from building materials to  in this case  a packaging corner block. So I've said a number of times that we grow materials. And it's kind of hard to picture how that happens. So my team has taken five days worth of growth  a typical growth cycle for us  and condensed it into a    second time lapse. And I want you to really watch closely these little white dots on the screen  because  over the five day period  what they do is extend out and through this material  using the energy that's contained in these seed husks to build this chitinous polymer matrix. This matrix self assembles  growing through and around the particles  making millions and millions of tiny fibers. And what parts of the seed husk we don't digest  actually become part of the final  physical composite. So in front of your eyes  this part just self assembled. It actually takes a little longer. It takes five days. But it's much faster than conventional farming. The last step  of course  is application. In this case  we've grown a corner block. A major Fortune     furniture maker uses these corner blocks to protect their tables in shipment. They used to use a plastic packaging buffer  but we were able to give them the exact same physical performance with our grown material. Best of all  when it gets to the customer  it's not trash. They can actually put this in their natural ecosystem without any processing  and it's going to improve the local soil. So  why mycelium  The first reason is local open feedstocks. You want to be able to do this anywhere in the world and not worry about peak rice hull or peak cottonseed hulls  because you have multiple choices. The next is self assembly  because the organism is actually doing most of the work in this process. You don't need a lot of equipment to set up a production facility. So you can have lots of small facilities spread all across the world. Biological yield is really important. And because     percent of what we put in the tool become the final product  even the parts that aren't digested become part of the structure  we're getting incredible yield rates. Natural polymers  well ... I think that's what's most important  because these polymers have been tried and tested in our ecosystem for the last billion years  in everything from mushrooms to crustaceans. They're not going to clog up Earth's ecosystems. They work great. And while  today  we can practically guarantee that yesterday's packaging is going to be here in        years  what I want to guarantee is that in        years  our descendants  our children's children  will be living happily and in harmony with a healthy Earth. And I think that can be some really good news. Thank you. I want to talk to you today about prosperity  about our hopes for a shared and lasting prosperity. And not just us  but the two billion people worldwide who are still chronically undernourished. And hope actually is at the heart of this. In fact  the Latin word for hope is at the heart of the word prosperity.  Pro speras    speras   hope    in accordance with our hopes and expectations. The irony is  though  that we have cashed out prosperity almost literally in terms of money and economic growth. And we've grown our economies so much that we now stand in a real danger of undermining hope    running down resources  cutting down rainforests  spilling oil into the Gulf of Mexico  changing the climate    and the only thing that has actually remotely slowed down the relentless rise of carbon emissions over the last two to three decades is recession. And recession  of course  isn't exactly a recipe for hope either  as we're busy finding out. So we're caught in a kind of trap. It's a dilemma  a dilemma of growth. We can't live with it  we can't live without it. Trash the system or crash the planet    it's a tough choice  it isn't much of a choice. And our best avenue of escape from this actually is a kind of blind faith in our own cleverness and technology and efficiency and doing things more efficiently. Now I haven't got anything against efficiency. And I think we are a clever species sometimes. But I think we should also just check the numbers  take a reality check here. So I want you to imagine a world  in       of around nine billion people  all aspiring to Western incomes  Western lifestyles. And I want to ask the question    and we'll give them that two percent hike in income  in salary each year as well  because we believe in growth. And I want to ask the question  how far and how fast would be have to move  How clever would we have to be  How much technology would we need in this world to deliver our carbon targets  And here in my chart    on the left hand side is where we are now. This is the carbon intensity of economic growth in the economy at the moment. It's around about     grams of carbon. In the world I describe to you  we have to be right over here at the right hand side at six grams of carbon. It's a     fold improvement  and that is    times further and faster than anything we've ever achieved in industrial history. Maybe we can do it  maybe it's possible    who knows  Maybe we can even go further and get an economy that pulls carbon out of the atmosphere  which is what we're going to need to be doing by the end of the century. But shouldn't we just check first that the economic system that we have is remotely capable of delivering this kind of improvement  So I want to just spend a couple of minutes on system dynamics. It's a bit complex  and I apologize for that. What I'll try and do  is I'll try and paraphrase it is sort of human terms. So it looks a little bit like this. Firms produce goods for households    that's us    and provide us with incomes  and that's even better  because we can spend those incomes on more goods and services. That's called the circular flow of the economy. It looks harmless enough. I just want to highlight one key feature of this system  which is the role of investment. Now investment constitutes only about a fifth of the national income in most modern economies  but it plays an absolutely vital role. And what it does essentially is to stimulate further consumption growth. It does this in a couple of ways    chasing productivity  which drives down prices and encourages us to buy more stuff. But I want to concentrate on the role of investment in seeking out novelty  the production and consumption of novelty. Joseph Schumpeter called this  the process of creative destruction.  It's a process of the production and reproduction of novelty  continually chasing expanding consumer markets  consumer goods  new consumer goods. And this  this is where it gets interesting  because it turns out that human beings have something of an appetite for novelty. We love new stuff    new material stuff for sure    but also new ideas  new adventures  new experiences. But the materiality matters too  because in every society that anthropologists have looked at  material stuff operates as a kind of language    a language of goods  a symbolic language that we use to tell each other stories    stories  for example  about how important we are. Status driven  conspicuous consumption thrives from the language of novelty. And here  all of a sudden  we have a system that is locking economic structure with social logic    the economic institutions  and who we are as people  locked together to drive an engine of growth. And this engine is not just economic value  it is pulling material resources relentlessly through the system  driven by our own insatiable appetites  driven in fact by a sense of anxiety. Adam Smith      years ago  spoke about our desire for a life without shame. A life without shame  in his day  what that meant was a linen shirt  and today  well  you still need the shirt  but you need the hybrid car  the HDTV  two holidays a year in the sun  the netbook and iPad  the list goes on    an almost inexhaustible supply of goods  driven by this anxiety. And even if we don't want them  we need to buy them  because  if we don't buy them  the system crashes. And to stop it crashing over the last two to three decades  we've expanded the money supply  expanded credit and debt  so that people can keep buying stuff. And of course  that expansion was deeply implicated in the crisis. But this    I just want to show you some data here. This is what it looks like  essentially  this credit and debt system  just for the U.K. This was the last    years before the crash  and you can see there  consumer debt rose dramatically. It was above the GDP for three years in a row just before the crisis. And in the mean time  personal savings absolutely plummeted. The savings ratio  net savings  were below zero in the middle of       just before the crash. This is people expanding debt  drawing down their savings  just to stay in the game. This is a strange  rather perverse  story  just to put it in very simple terms. It's a story about us  people  being persuaded to spend money we don't have on things we don't need to create impressions that won't last on people we don't care about. But before we consign ourselves to despair  maybe we should just go back and say   Did we get this right  Is this really how people are  Is this really how economies behave   And almost straightaway we actually run up against a couple of anomalies. The first one is in the crisis itself. In the crisis  in the recession  what do people want to do  They want to hunker down  they want to look to the future. They want to spend less and save more. But saving is exactly the wrong thing to do from the system point of view. Keynes called this the  paradox of thrift     saving slows down recovery. And politicians call on us continually to draw down more debt  to draw down our own savings even further  just so that we can get the show back on the road  so we can keep this growth based economy going. It's an anomaly  it's a place where the system actually is at odds with who we are as people. Here's another one    completely different one  Why is it that we don't do the blindingly obvious things we should do to combat climate change  very  very simple things like buying energy efficient appliances  putting in efficient lights  turning the lights off occasionally  insulating our homes  These things save carbon  they save energy  they save us money. So is it that  though they make perfect economic sense  we don't do them  Well  I had my own personal insight into this a few years ago. It was a Sunday evening  Sunday afternoon  and it was just after    actually  to be honest  too long after    we had moved into a new house. And I had finally got around to doing some draft stripping  installing insulation around the windows and doors to keep out the drafts. And my  then  five year old daughter was helping me in the way that five year olds do. And we'd been doing this for a while  when she turned to me very solemnly and said   Will this really keep out the giraffes    Here they are  the giraffes.  You can hear the five year old mind working. These ones  interestingly  are     miles north of here outside Barrow in Furness in Cumbria. Goodness knows what they make of the Lake District weather. But actually that childish misrepresentation stuck with me  because it suddenly became clear to me why we don't do the blindingly obvious things. We're too busy keeping out the giraffes    putting the kids on the bus in the morning  getting ourselves to work on time  surviving email overload and shop floor politics  foraging for groceries  throwing together meals  escaping for a couple of precious hours in the evening into prime time TV or TED online  getting from one end of the day to the other  keeping out the giraffes. What is the objective   What is the objective of the consumer   Mary Douglas asked in an essay on poverty written    years ago.  It is   she said   to help create the social world and find a credible place in it.  That is a deeply humanizing vision of our lives  and it's a completely different vision than the one that lies at the heart of this economic model. So who are we  Who are these people  Are we these novelty seeking  hedonistic  selfish individuals  Or might we actually occasionally be something like the selfless altruist depicted in Rembrandt's lovely  lovely sketch here  Well psychology actually says there is a tension    a tension between self regarding behaviors and other regarding behaviors. And these tensions have deep evolutionary roots  so selfish behavior is adaptive in certain circumstances    fight or flight. But other regarding behaviors are essential to our evolution as social beings. And perhaps even more interesting from our point of view  another tension between novelty seeking behaviors and tradition or conservation. Novelty is adaptive when things are changing and you need to adapt yourself. Tradition is essential to lay down the stability to raise families and form cohesive social groups. So here  all of a sudden  we're looking at a map of the human heart. And it reveals to us  suddenly  the crux of the matter. What we've done is we've created economies. We've created systems  which systematically privilege  encourage  one narrow quadrant of the human soul and left the others unregarded. And in the same token  the solution becomes clear  because this isn't  therefore  about changing human nature. It isn't  in fact  about curtailing possibilities. It is about opening up. It is about allowing ourselves the freedom to become fully human  recognizing the depth and the breadth of the human psyche and building institutions to protect Rembrandt's fragile altruist within. What does all this mean for economics  What would economies look like if we took that vision of human nature at their heart and stretched them along these orthogonal dimensions of the human psyche  Well  it might look a little bit like the       community interest companies that have sprung up in the U.K. over the last five years and a similar rise in B corporations in the United States  enterprises that have ecological and social goals written into their constitution at their heart    companies  in fact  like this one  Ecosia. And I just want to  very quickly  show you this. Ecosia is an Internet search engine. Internet search engines work by drawing revenues from sponsored links that appear when you do a search. And Ecosia works in pretty much the same way. So we can do that here    we can just put in a little search term. There you go  Oxford  that's where we are. See what comes up. The difference with Ecosia though is that  in Ecosia's case  it draws the revenues in the same way  but it allocates    percent of those revenues to a rainforest protection project in the Amazon. And we're going to do it. We're just going to click on Naturejobs.uk. In case anyone out there is looking for a job in a recession  that's the page to go to. And what happened then was the sponsor gave revenues to Ecosia  and Ecosia is giving    percent of those revenues to a rainforest protection project. It's taking profits from one place and allocating them into the protection of ecological resources. It's a different kind of enterprise for a new economy. It's a form  if you like  of ecological altruism    perhaps something along those lines. Maybe it's that. Whatever it is  whatever this new economy is  what we need the economy to do  in fact  is to put investment back into the heart of the model  to re conceive investment. Only now  investment isn't going to be about the relentless and mindless pursuit of consumption growth. Investment has to be a different beast. Investment has to be  in the new economy  protecting and nurturing the ecological assets on which our future depends. It has to be about transition. It has to be investing in low carbon technologies and infrastructures. We have to invest  in fact  in the idea of a meaningful prosperity  providing capabilities for people to flourish. And of course  this task has material dimensions. It would be nonsense to talk about people flourishing if they didn't have food  clothing and shelter. But it's also clear that prosperity goes beyond this. It has social and psychological aims    family  friendship  commitments  society  participating in the life of that society. And this too requires investment  investment    for example  in places    places where we can connect  places where we can participate  shared spaces  concert halls  gardens  public parks  libraries  museums  quiet centers  places of joy and celebration  places of tranquility and contemplation  sites for the  cultivation of a common citizenship   in Michael Sandel's lovely phrase. An investment    investment  after all  is just such a basic economic concept    is nothing more nor less than a relationship between the present and the future  a shared present and a common future. And we need that relationship to reflect  to reclaim hope. So let me come back  with this sense of hope  to the two billion people still trying to live each day on less than the price of a skinny latte from the cafe next door. What can we offer those people  It's clear that we have a responsibility to help lift them out of poverty. It's clear that we have a responsibility to make room for growth where growth really matters in those poorest nations. And it's also clear that we will never achieve that unless we're capable of redefining a meaningful sense of prosperity in the richer nations  a prosperity that is more meaningful and less materialistic than the growth based model. So this is not just a Western post materialist fantasy. In fact  an African philosopher wrote to me  when  Prosperity Without Growth  was published  pointing out the similarities between this view of prosperity and the traditional African concept of ubuntu. Ubuntu says   I am because we are.  Prosperity is a shared endeavor. Its roots are long and deep    its foundations  I've tried to show  exist already  inside each of us. So this is not about standing in the way of development. It's not about overthrowing capitalism. It's not about trying to change human nature. What we're doing here is we're taking a few simple steps towards an economics fit for purpose. And at the heart of that economics  we're placing a more credible  more robust  and more realistic vision of what it means to be human. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  While they're taking the podium away  just a quick question. First of all  economists aren't supposed to be inspiring  so you may need to work on the tone a little. Can you picture the politicians ever buying into this  I mean  can you picture a politician standing up in Britain and saying   GDP fell two percent this year. Good news  We're actually all happier  and a country's more beautiful  and our lives are better.  Tim Jackson  Well that's clearly not what you're doing. You're not making news out of things falling down. You're making news out of the things that tell you that we're flourishing. Can I picture politicians doing it  Actually  I already am seeing a little bit of it. When we first started this kind of work  politicians would stand up  treasury spokesmen would stand up  and accuse us of wanting to go back and live in caves. And actually in the period through which we've been working over the last    years    partly because of the financial crisis and a little bit of humility in the profession of economics    actually people are engaging in this issue in all sorts of countries around the world. CA  But is it mainly politicians who are going to have to get their act together  or is it going to be more just civil society and companies  TJ  It has to be companies. It has to be civil society. But it has to have political leadership. This is a kind of agenda  which actually politicians themselves are kind of caught in that dilemma  because they're hooked on the growth model themselves. But actually opening up the space to think about different ways of governing  different kinds of politics  and creating the space for civil society and businesses to operate differently    absolutely vital. CA  And if someone could convince you that we actually can make the    what was it     the     fold improvement in efficiency  of reduction of carbon footprint  would you then actually like that picture of economic growth into more knowledge based goods  TJ  I would still want to know that you could do that and get below zero by the end of the century  in terms of taking carbon out of the atmosphere  and solve the problem of biodiversity and reduce the impact on land use and do something about the erosion of topsoils and the quality of water. If you can convince me we can do all that  then  yes  I would take the two percent. CA  Tim  thank you for a very important talk. Thank you. I've been fascinated for a lifetime by the beauty  form and function of giant bluefin tuna. Bluefin are warmblooded like us. They're the largest of the tunas  the second largest fish in the sea    bony fish. They actually are a fish that is endothermic    powers through the ocean with warm muscles like a mammal. That's one of our bluefin at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. You can see in its shape and its streamlined design it's powered for ocean swimming. It flies through the ocean on its pectoral fins  gets lift  powers its movements with a lunate tail. It's actually got a naked skin for most of its body  so it reduces friction with the water. This is what one of nature's finest machines. Now  bluefin were revered by Man for all of human history. For       years  we fished sustainably for this animal  and it's evidenced in the art that we see from thousands of years ago. Bluefin are in cave paintings in France. They're on coins that date back       years. This fish was revered by humankind. It was fished sustainably till all of time  except for our generation. Bluefin are pursued wherever they go    there is a gold rush on Earth  and this is a gold rush for bluefin. There are traps that fish sustainably up until recently. And yet  the type of fishing going on today  with pens  with enormous stakes  is really wiping bluefin ecologically off the planet. Now bluefin  in general  goes to one place  Japan. Some of you may be guilty of having contributed to the demise of bluefin. They're delectable muscle  rich in fat    absolutely taste delicious. And that's their problem  we're eating them to death. Now in the Atlantic  the story is pretty simple. Bluefin have two populations  one large  one small. The North American population is fished at about       ton. The European population and North African    the Eastern bluefin tuna    is fished at tremendous levels         tons over the last decade almost every year. The result is whether you're looking at the West or the Eastern bluefin population  there's been tremendous decline on both sides  as much as    percent if you go back with your baseline to     . For that  bluefin have been given a status equivalent to tigers  to lions  to certain African elephants and to pandas. These fish have been proposed for an endangered species listing in the past two months. They were voted on and rejected just two weeks ago  despite outstanding science that shows from two committees this fish meets the criteria of CITES I. And if it's tunas you don't care about  perhaps you might be interested that international long lines and pursing chase down tunas and bycatch animals such as leatherbacks  sharks  marlin  albatross. These animals and their demise occurs in the tuna fisheries. The challenge we face is that we know very little about tuna  and everyone in the room knows what it looks like when an African lion takes down its prey. I doubt anyone has seen a giant bluefin feed. This tuna symbolizes what's the problem for all of us in the room. It's the   st century  but we really have only just begun to really study our oceans in a deep way. Technology has come of age that's allowing us to see the Earth from space and go deep into the seas remotely. And we've got to use these technologies immediately to get a better understanding of how our ocean realm works. Most of us from the ship    even I    look out at the ocean and see this homogeneous sea. We don't know where the structure is. We can't tell where are the watering holes like we can on an African plain. We can't see the corridors  and we can't see what it is that brings together a tuna  a leatherback and an albatross. We're only just beginning to understand how the physical oceanography and the biological oceanography come together to create a seasonal force that actually causes the upwelling that might make a hot spot a hope spot. The reasons these challenges are great is that technically it's difficult to go to sea. It's hard to study a bluefin on its turf  the entire Pacific realm. It's really tough to get up close and personal with a mako shark and try to put a tag on it. And then imagine being Bruce Mate's team from OSU  getting up close to a blue whale and fixing a tag on the blue whale that stays  an engineering challenge we've yet to really overcome. So the story of our team  a dedicated team  is fish and chips. We basically are taking the same satellite phone parts  or the same parts that are in your computer  chips. We're putting them together in unusual ways  and this is taking us into the ocean realm like never before. And for the first time  we're able to watch the journey of a tuna beneath the ocean using light and photons to measure sunrise and sunset. Now  I've been working with tunas for over    years. I have the privilege of being a partner with the Monterey Bay Aquarium. We've actually taken a sliver of the ocean  put it behind glass  and we together have put bluefin tuna and yellowfin tuna on display. When the veil of bubbles lifts every morning  we can actually see a community from the Pelagic ocean  one of the only places on Earth you can see giant bluefin swim by. We can see in their beauty of form and function  their ceaseless activity. They're flying through their space  ocean space. And we can bring two million people a year into contact with this fish and show them its beauty. Behind the scenes is a working lab at Stanford University partnered with the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Here  for over    or    years  we've actually brought in both bluefin and yellowfin in captivity. We'd been studying these fish  but first we had to learn how to husbandry them. What do they like to eat  What is it that they're happy with  We go in the tanks with the tuna    we touch their naked skin    it's pretty amazing. It feels wonderful. And then  better yet  we've got our own version of tuna whisperers  our own Chuck Farwell  Alex Norton  who can take a big tuna and in one motion  put it into an envelope of water  so that we can actually work with the tuna and learn the techniques it takes to not injure this fish who never sees a boundary in the open sea. Jeff and Jason there  are scientists who are going to take a tuna and put it in the equivalent of a treadmill  a flume. And that tuna thinks it's going to Japan  but it's staying in place. We're actually measuring its oxygen consumption  its energy consumption. We're taking this data and building better models. And when I see that tuna    this is my favorite view    I begin to wonder  how did this fish solve the longitude problem before we did  So take a look at that animal. That's the closest you'll probably ever get. Now  the activities from the lab have taught us now how to go out in the open ocean. So in a program called Tag A Giant we've actually gone from Ireland to Canada  from Corsica to Spain. We've fished with many nations around the world in an effort to basically put electronic computers inside giant tunas. We've actually tagged       tunas. And I'm going to show you three clips  because I tagged       tunas. It's a very hard process  but it's a ballet. We bring the tuna out  we measure it. A team of fishers  captains  scientists and technicians work together to keep this animal out of the ocean for about four to five minutes. We put water over its gills  give it oxygen. And then with a lot of effort  after tagging  putting in the computer  making sure the stalk is sticking out so it senses the environment  we send this fish back into the sea. And when it goes  we're always happy. We see a flick of the tail. And from our data that gets collected  when that tag comes back  because a fisher returns it for a thousand dollar reward  we can get tracks beneath the sea for up to five years now  on a backboned animal. Now sometimes the tunas are really large  such as this fish off Nantucket. But that's about half the size of the biggest tuna we've ever tagged. It takes a human effort  a team effort  to bring the fish in. In this case  what we're going to do is put a pop up satellite archival tag on the tuna. This tag rides on the tuna  senses the environment around the tuna and actually will come off the fish  detach  float to the surface and send back to Earth orbiting satellites position data estimated by math on the tag  pressure data and temperature data. And so what we get then from the pop up satellite tag is we get away from having to have a human interaction to recapture the tag. Both the electronic tags I'm talking about are expensive. These tags have been engineered by a variety of teams in North America. They are some of our finest instruments  our new technology in the ocean today. One community in general has given more to help us than any other community. And that's the fisheries off the state of North Carolina. There are two villages  Harris and Morehead City  every winter for over a decade  held a party called Tag A Giant  and together  fishers worked with us to tag     to     fish. In this case  we're actually going to measure the fish. We're going to do something that in recent years we've started  take a mucus sample. Watch how shiny the skin is  you can see my reflection there. And from that mucus  we can get gene profiles  we can get information on gender  checking the pop up tag one more time  and then it's out in the ocean. And this is my favorite. With the help of my former postdoc  Gareth Lawson  this is a gorgeous picture of a single tuna. This tuna is actually moving on a numerical ocean. The warm is the Gulf Stream  the cold up there in the Gulf of Maine. That's where the tuna wants to go    it wants to forage on schools of herring    but it can't get there. It's too cold. But then it warms up  and the tuna pops in  gets some fish  maybe comes back to home base  goes in again and then comes back to winter down there in North Carolina and then on to the Bahamas. And my favorite scene  three tunas going into the Gulf of Mexico. Three tunas tagged. Astronomically  we're calculating positions. They're coming together. That could be tuna sex    and there it is. That is where the tuna spawn. So from data like this  we're able now to put the map up  and in this map you see thousands of positions generated by this decade and a half of tagging. And now we're showing that tunas on the western side go to the eastern side. So two populations of tunas    that is  we have a Gulf population  one that we can tag    they go to the Gulf of Mexico  I showed you that    and a second population. Living amongst our tunas    our North American tunas    are European tunas that go back to the Med. On the hot spots    the hope spots    they're mixed populations. And so what we've done with the science is we're showing the International Commission  building new models  showing them that a two stock no mixing model    to this day  used to reject the CITES treaty    that model isn't the right model. This model  a model of overlap  is the way to move forward. So we can then predict where management places should be. Places like the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean are places where the single species  the single population  can be captured. These become forthright in places we need to protect. The center of the Atlantic where the mixing is  I could imagine a policy that lets Canada and America fish  because they manage their fisheries well  they're doing a good job. But in the international realm  where fishing and overfishing has really gone wild  these are the places that we have to make hope spots in. That's the size they have to be to protect the bluefin tuna. Now in a second project called Tagging of Pacific Pelagics  we took on the planet as a team  those of us in the Census of Marine Life. And  funded primarily through Sloan Foundation and others  we were able to actually go in  in our project    we're one of    field programs and begin to take on tagging large numbers of predators  not just tunas. So what we've done is actually gone up to tag salmon shark in Alaska  met salmon shark on their home territory  followed them catching salmon and then went in and figured out that  if we take a salmon and put it on a line  we can actually take up a salmon shark    This is the cousin of the white shark    and very carefully    note  I say  very carefully      we can actually keep it calm  put a hose in its mouth  keep it off the deck and then tag it with a satellite tag. That satellite tag will now have your shark phone home and send in a message. And that shark leaping there  if you look carefully  has an antenna. It's a free swimming shark with a satellite tag jumping after salmon  sending home its data. Salmon sharks aren't the only sharks we tag. But there goes salmon sharks with this meter level resolution on an ocean of temperature    warm colors are warmer. Salmon sharks go down to the tropics to pup and come into Monterey. Now right next door in Monterey and up at the Farallones are a white shark team led by Scott Anderson    there    and Sal Jorgensen. They can throw out a target    it's a carpet shaped like a seal    and in will come a white shark  a curious critter that will come right up to our    ft. boat. It's a several thousand pound animal. And we'll wind in the target. And we'll place an acoustic tag that says   OMSHARK         or something like that  acoustically with a ping. And then we'll put on a satellite tag that will give us the long distance journeys with the light based geolocation algorithms solved on the computer that's on the fish. So in this case  Sal's looking at two tags there  and there they are  the white sharks of California going off to the white shark cafe and coming back. We also tag makos with our NOAA colleagues  blue sharks. And now  together  what we can see on this ocean of color that's temperature  we can see ten day worms of makos and salmon sharks. We have white sharks and blue sharks. For the first time  an ecoscape as large as ocean scale  showing where the sharks go. The tuna team from TOPP has done the unthinkable  three teams tagged       tunas  bluefin  yellowfin and albacore all at the same time    carefully rehearsed tagging programs in which we go out  pick up juvenile tunas  put in the tags that actually have the sensors  stick out the tuna and then let them go. They get returned  and when they get returned  here on a NASA numerical ocean you can see bluefin in blue go across their corridor  returning to the Western Pacific. Our team from UCSC has tagged elephant seals with tags that are glued on their heads  that come off when they slough. These elephant seals cover half an ocean  take data down to       feet    amazing data. And then there's Scott Shaffer and our shearwaters wearing tuna tags  light based tags  that now are going to take you from New Zealand to Monterey and back  journeys of        nautical miles we had never seen before. But now with light based geolocation tags that are very small  we can actually see these journeys. Same thing with Laysan albatross who travel an entire ocean on a trip sometimes  up to the same zone the tunas use. You can see why they might be caught. Then there's George Schillinger and our leatherback team out of Playa Grande tagging leatherbacks that go right past where we are. And Scott Benson's team that showed that leatherbacks go from Indonesia all the way to Monterey. So what we can see on this moving ocean is we can finally see where the predators are. We can actually see how they're using ecospaces as large as an ocean. And from this information  we can begin to map the hope spots. So this is just three years of data right here    and there's a decade of this data. We see the pulse and the seasonal activities that these animals are going on. So what we're able to do with this information is boil it down to hot spots        deployments  a huge herculean task        tags in an area  shown here for the first time  off the California coast  that appears to be a gathering place. And then for sort of an encore from these animals  they're helping us. They're carrying instruments that are actually taking data down to       meters. They're taking information from our planet at very critical places like Antarctica and the Poles. Those are seals from many countries being released who are sampling underneath the ice sheets and giving us temperature data of oceanographic quality on both poles. This data  when visualized  is captivating to watch. We still haven't figured out best how to visualize the data. And then  as these animals swim and give us the information that's important to climate issues  we also think it's critical to get this information to the public  to engage the public with this kind of data. We did this with the Great Turtle Race    tagged turtles  brought in four million hits. And now with Google's Oceans  we can actually put a white shark in that ocean. And when we do and it swims  we see this magnificent bathymetry that the shark knows is there on its path as it goes from California to Hawaii. But maybe Mission Blue can fill in that ocean that we can't see. We've got the capacity  NASA has the ocean. We just need to put it together. So in conclusion  we know where Yellowstone is for North America  it's off our coast. We have the technology that's shown us where it is. What we need to think about perhaps for Mission Blue is increasing the biologging capacity. How is it that we can actually take this type of activity elsewhere  And then finally    to basically get the message home    maybe use live links from animals such as blue whales and white sharks. Make killer apps  if you will. A lot of people are excited when sharks actually went under the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's connect the public to this activity right on their iPhone. That way we do away with a few internet myths. So we can save the bluefin tuna. We can save the white shark. We have the science and technology. Hope is here. Yes we can. We need just to apply this capacity further in the oceans. Thank you. We are here today because  the  United Nations have defined goals for the progress of countries. They're called Millennium Development Goals. And the reason I really like these goals is that there are eight of them. And by specifying eight different goals  the United Nations has said that there are so many things needed to change in a country in order to get the good life for people. Look here    you have to end poverty  education  gender  child and maternal health  control infections  protect the environment and get the good global links between nations in every aspect from aid to trade. There's a second reason I like these development goals  and that is because each and every one is measured. Take child mortality  the aim here is to reduce child mortality by two thirds  from      to     . That's a four percent reduction per year    and this  with measuring. That's what makes the difference between political talking like this and really going for the important thing  a better life for people. And what I'm so happy about with this is that we have already documented that there are many countries in Asia  in the Middle East  in Latin America and East Europe that  are  reducing with this rate. And even mighty Brazil is going down with five percent per year  and Turkey with seven percent per year. So there's good news. But then I hear people saying   There is no progress in Africa. And there's not even statistics on Africa to know what is happening.  I'll prove them wrong on both points. Come with me to the wonderful world of statistics. I bring you to the webpage  ChildMortality.org  where you can take deaths in children below five years of age for all countries    it's done by U.N. specialists. And I will take Kenya as an example. Here you see the data. Don't panic    don't panic now  I'll help you through this. It looks nasty  like in college when you didn't like statistics. But first thing  when you see dots like this  you have to ask yourself  from where do the data come  What is the origin of the data  Is it so that in Kenya  there are doctors and other specialists who write the death certificate at the death of the child and it's sent to the statistical office  No    low income countries like Kenya still don't have that level of organization. It exists  but it's not complete because so many deaths occur in the home with the family  and it's not registered. What we rely on is not an incomplete system. We have interviews  we have surveys. And this is highly professional female interviewers who sit down for one hour with a woman and ask her about  her  birth history. How many children did you have  Are they alive  If they died  at what age and what year  And then this is done in a representative sample of thousands of women in the country and put together in what used to be called a demographic health survey report. But these surveys are costly  so they can only be done  in  three  to five year intervals. But they have good quality. So this is a limitation. And all these colored lines here are results  each color is one survey. But that's too complicated for today  so I'll simplify it for you  and I give you one average point for each survey. This was                   '   and     . And when the experts in the U.N. have got these surveys in place in their database  then they use advanced mathematical formulas to produce a trend line  and the trend line looks like this. See here    it's the best fit they can get of this point. But watch out    they continue the line beyond the last point out into nothing. And they estimated that in       Kenya had per child mortality of    . And I was sad  because we could see this reversal in Kenya with an increased child mortality in the   s. It was so tragic. But in June  I got a mail in my inbox from Demographic Health Surveys  and it showed good news from Kenya. I was so happy. This was the estimate of the new survey. Then it just took another three months for  the  U.N. to get it into their server  and on Friday we got the new trend line    it was down here. Isn't it nice    isn't it nice  yeah  I was actually  on Friday  sitting in front of my computer  and I saw the death rate fall from     to    just that morning. So we celebrated. But now  when you have this trend line  how do we measure progress  I'm going into some details here  because  the  U.N. do it like this. They start  in          they measure to     . They say    .  percent  no progress.  That's unfair. As a professor  I think I have the right to propose something differently. I would say  at least do this       years is enough to follow the trend. It's two surveys  and you can see what's happening now. They have  .  percent. Had I been in the Ministry of Health in Kenya  I may have joined these two points. So what I'm telling you is that we know the child mortality. We have a decent trend. It's coming into some tricky things then when we are measuring MDGs. And the reason here for Africa is especially important  because '  s was a bad decade  not only in Kenya  but across Africa. The HIV epidemic peaked. There was resistance for the old malaria drugs  until we got the new drugs. We got  later  the mosquito netting. And there was socio economic problems  which are now being solved at a much better scale. So look at the average here    this is the average for all of sub Saharan Africa. And  the  U.N. says it's a reduction with  .  percent. Now this sounds a little theoretical  but it's not so theoretical. You know  these economists  they love money  they want more and more of it  they want it to grow. So they calculate the percent annual growth rate of  the  economy. We in public health  we hate child death  so we want less and less and less of child deaths. So we calculate the percent reduction per year  but it's sort of the same percentage. If your economy grows with four percent  you ought to reduce child mortality four percent  if it's used well and people are really involved and can get the use of the resources in the way they want it. So is this fair now to measure this over    years  An economist would never do that. I have just divided it into two periods. In the   s  only  .  percent  only  .  percent. Whereas now  second gear    it's like Africa had first gear  now they go into second gear. But even this is not a fair representation of Africa  because it's an average  it's an average speed of reduction in Africa. And look here when I take you into my bubble graphs. Still here  child death per       on that axis. Here we have  the  year. And I'm now giving you a wider picture than the MDG. I start    years ago when Africa celebrated independence in most countries. I give you Congo  which was high  Ghana    lower. And Kenya    even lower. And what has happened over the years since then  Here we go. You can see  with independence  literacy improved and vaccinations started  smallpox was eradicated  hygiene was improved  and things got better. But then  in the '  s  watch out here. Congo got into civil war  and they leveled off here. Ghana got very ahead  fast. This was the backlash in Kenya  and Ghana bypassed  but then Kenya and Ghana go down together    still a standstill in Congo. That's where we are today. You can see it doesn't make sense to make an average of this zero improvement and this very fast improvement. Time has come to stop thinking about sub Saharan Africa as one place. Their countries are so different  and they merit to be recognized in the same way  as we don't talk about Europe as one place. I can tell you that the economy in Greece and Sweden are very different    everyone knows that. And they are judged  each country  on how they are doing. So let me show the wider picture. My country  Sweden        we were up there. What a strange personality disorder we must have  counting the children so meticulously in spite of a high child death rate. It's very strange. It's sort of embarrassing. But we had that habit in Sweden  you know  that we counted all the child deaths  even if we didn't do anything about it. And then  you see  these were famine years. These were bad years  and people got fed up with Sweden. My ancestors moved to the United States. And eventually  soon they started to get better and better here. And here we got better education  and we got health service  and child mortality came down. We never had a war  Sweden was in peace all this time. But look  the rate of lowering in Sweden was not fast. Sweden achieved a low child mortality because we started early. We had primary school actually started in     . And then you get that wonderful effect when we got female literacy one generation later. You have to realize that the investments we do in progress are long term investments. It's not about just five years    it's long term investments. And Sweden never reached  the  Millennium Development Goal rate   .  percent when I calculated. So we are off track    that's what Sweden is. But you don't talk about it so much. We want others to be better than we were  and indeed  others have been better. Let me show you Thailand  see what a success story  Thailand from the     s    how they went down here and reached almost the same child mortality levels as Sweden. And I'll give you another story    Egypt  the most hidden  glorious success in public health. Egypt was up here in       higher than Congo. The Nile Delta was a misery for children with diarrheal disease and malaria and a lot of problems. And then they got the Aswan Dam. They got electricity in their homes  they increased education and they got primary health care. And down they went  you know. And they got safer water  they eradicated malaria. And isn't it a success story. Millennium Development Goal rates for child mortality is fully possible. And the good thing is that Ghana today is going with the same rate as Egypt did at its fastest. Kenya is now speeding up. Here we have a problem. We have a severe problem in countries which are at a standstill. Now  let me now bring you to a wider picture  a wider picture of child mortality. I'm going to show you the relationship between child mortality on this axis here    this axis here is child mortality    and here I have the family size. The relationship between child mortality and family size. One  two  three  four children per woman  six  seven  eight children per woman. This is  once again             years ago. Each bubble is a country    the color  you can see  a continent. The dark blue here is sub Saharan Africa. And the size of the bubble is the population. And these are the so called  developing  countries. They had high  or very high  child mortality and family size  six to eight. And the ones over there  they were so called Western countries. They had low child mortality and small families. What has happened  What I want you  to do  now is to see with your own eyes the relation between fall in child mortality and decrease in family size. I just want not to have any room for doubt    you have to see that for yourself. This is what happened. Now I start the world. Here we come down with the eradication of smallpox  better education  health service. It got down there    China comes into the Western box here. And here Brazil is in the Western Box. India is approaching. The first African countries coming into the Western box  and we get a lot a new neighbors. Welcome to a decent life. Come on. We want everyone down there. This is the vision we have  isn't it. And look now  the first African countries here are coming in. There we are today. There is no such thing as a  Western world  and  developing world.  This is the report from  the  U.N.  which came out on Friday. It's very good     Levels and Trends in Child Mortality     except this page. This page is very bad  it's a categorization of countries. It labels  developing countries      I can read from the list here    developing countries  Republic of Korea    South Korea. Huh  They get Samsung  how can they be  a  developing country  They have here Singapore. They have the lowest child mortality in the world  Singapore. They bypassed Sweden five years ago  and they are labeled a developing country. They have here Qatar. It's the richest country in the world with Al Jazeera. How the heck could they be  a  developing country  This is crap. The rest here is good    the rest is good. We have to have a modern concept  which fits to the data. And we have to realize that we are all going to into this  down to here. What is the importance now with the relations here. Look    even if we look in Africa    these are the African countries. You can clearly see the relation with falling child mortality and decreasing family size  even within Africa. It's very clear that this is what happens. And a very important piece of research came out on Friday from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle showing that almost    percent of the fall in child mortality can be attributed to female education. That is  when we get girls in school  we'll get an impact    to    years later  which is a secular trend which is very strong. That's why we must have that long term perspective  but we must measure the impact over    year periods. It's fully possible to get child mortality down in all of these countries and to get them down in the corner where we all would like to live together. And of course  lowering child mortality is a matter of utmost importance from humanitarian aspects. It's a decent life for children  we are talking about. But it is also a strategic investment in the future of all mankind  because it's about the environment. We will not be able to manage the environment and avoid the terrible climate crisis if we don't stabilize the world population. Let's be clear about that. And the way to do that  that is to get child mortality down  get access to family planning and behind that drive female education. And that is fully possible. Let's do it. Thank you very much. Imagine  if you will    a gift. I'd like for you to picture it in your mind. It's not too big    about the size of a golf ball. So envision what it looks like all wrapped up. But before I show you what's inside  I will tell you  it's going to do incredible things for you. It will bring all of your family together. You will feel loved and appreciated like never before and reconnect with friends and acquaintances you haven't heard from in years. Adoration and admiration will overwhelm you. It will recalibrate what's most important in your life. It will redefine your sense of spirituality and faith. You'll have a new understanding and trust in your body. You'll have unsurpassed vitality and energy. You'll expand your vocabulary  meet new people  and you'll have a healthier lifestyle. And get this    you'll have an eight week vacation of doing absolutely nothing. You'll eat countless gourmet meals. Flowers will arrive by the truckload. People will say to you   You look great. Have you had any work done   And you'll have a lifetime supply of good drugs. You'll be challenged  inspired  motivated and humbled. Your life will have new meaning. Peace  health  serenity  happiness  nirvana. The price           and that's an incredible deal. By now I know you're dying to know what it is and where you can get one. Does Amazon carry it  Does it have the Apple logo on it  Is there a waiting list  Not likely. This gift came to me about five months ago. It looked more like this when it was all wrapped up    not quite so pretty. And this  and then this. It was a rare gem    a brain tumor  hemangioblastoma    the gift that keeps on giving. And while I'm okay now  I wouldn't wish this gift for you. I'm not sure you'd want it. But I wouldn't change my experience. It profoundly altered my life in ways I didn't expect in all the ways I just shared with you. So the next time you're faced with something that's unexpected  unwanted and uncertain  consider that it just may be a gift. Sometimes I go browsing  through  a very old magazine. I found this observation test about the story of the ark. And the artist that drew this observation test did some errors  had some mistakes    there are more or less    mistakes. Some of them are very easy. There is a funnel  an aerial part  a lamp and clockwork key on the ark. Some of them are about the animals  the number. But there is a much more fundamental mistake in the overall story of the ark that's not reported here. And this problem is  where are the plants  So now we have God that is going to submerge Earth permanently or at least for a very long period  and no one is taking care of plants. Noah needed to take two of every kind of bird  of every kind of animal  of every kind of creature that moves  but no mention about plants. Why  In another part of the same story  all the living creatures are just the living creatures that came out from the ark  so birds  livestock and wild animals. Plants are not living creatures    this is the point. That is a point that is not coming out from the Bible  but it's something that really accompanied humanity. Let's have a look at this nice code that is coming from a Renaissance book. Here we have the description of the order of nature. It's a nice description because it's starting from left    you have the stones    immediately after the stones  the plants that are just able to live. We have the animals that are able to live and to sense  and on the top of the pyramid  there is the man. This is not the common man. The  Homo studiosus     the studying man. This is quite comforting for people like me    I'm a professor    this to be over there on the top of creation. But it's something completely wrong. You know very well about professors. But it's also wrong about plants  because plants are not just able to live  they are able to sense. They are much more sophisticated in sensing than animals. Just to give you an example  every single root apex is able to detect and to monitor concurrently and continuously at least    different chemical and physical parameters. And they also are able to show and to exhibit such a wonderful and complex behavior that can be described just with the term of intelligence. Well  but this is something    this underestimation of plants is something that is always with us. Let's have a look at this short movie now. We have David Attenborough. Now David Attenborough is really a plant lover  he did some of the most beautiful movies about plant behavior. Now  when he speaks about plants  everything is correct. When he speaks about animals   he  tends to remove the fact that plants exist. The blue whale  the biggest creature that exists on the planet    that is wrong  completely wrong. The blue whale  it's a dwarf if compared with the real biggest creature that exists on the planet    that is  this wonderful  magnificent Sequoiadendron giganteum. And this is a living organism that has a mass of at least       tons. Now  the story that plants are some low level organisms has been formalized many times ago by Aristotle  that in  De Anima     that is a very influential book for the Western civilization    wrote that the plants are on the edge between living and not living. They have just a kind of very low level soul. It's called the vegetative soul  because they lack movement  and so they don't need to sense. Let's see. Okay  some of the movements of the plants are very well known. This is a very fast movement. This is a Dionaea  a Venus fly trap hunting snails    sorry for the snail. This has been something that has been refused for centuries  despite the evidence. No one can say that the plants were able to eat an animal  because it was against the order of nature. But plants are also able to show a lot of movement. Some of them are very well known  like the flowering. It's just a question to use some techniques like the time lapse. Some of them are much more sophisticated. Look at this young bean that is moving to catch the light every time. And it's really so graceful  it's like a dancing angel. They are also able to play    they are really playing. These are young sunflowers  and what they are doing cannot be described with any other terms than playing. They are training themselves  as many young animals do  to the adult life where they will be called to track the sun all the day. They are able to respond to gravity  of course  so the shoots are growing against the vector of gravity and the roots toward the vector of gravity. But they are also able to sleep. This is one  Mimosa pudica. So during the night  they curl the leaves and reduce the movement  and during the day  you have the opening of the leaves    there is much more movement. This is interesting because this sleeping machinery  it's perfectly conserved. It's the same in plants  in insects and in animals. And so if you need to study this sleeping problem  it's easy to study on plants  for example  than in animals and it's much more easy even ethically. It's a kind of vegetarian experimentation. Plants are even able to communicate    they are extraordinary communicators. They communicate with other plants. They are able to distinguish kin and non kin. They communicate with plants of other species and they communicate with animals by producing chemical volatiles  for example  during the pollination. Now with the pollination  it's a very serious issue for plants  because they move the pollen from one flower to the other  yet they cannot move from one flower to the other. So they need a vector    and this vector  it's normally an animal. Many insects have been used by plants as vectors for the transport of the pollination  but not just insects  even birds  reptiles  and mammals like bats rats are normally used for the transportation of the pollen. This is a serious business. We have the plants that are giving to the animals a kind of sweet substance    very energizing    having in change this transportation of the pollen. But some plants are manipulating animals  like in the case of orchids that promise sex and nectar and give in change nothing for the transportation of the pollen. Now  there is a big problem behind all this behavior that we have seen. How is it possible to do this without a brain  We need to wait until       when this big man  Charles Darwin  publishes a wonderful  astonishing book that starts a revolution. The title is  The Power of Movement in Plants.  No one was allowed to speak about movement in plants before Charles Darwin. In his book  assisted by his son  Francis    who was the first professor of plant physiology in the world  in Cambridge    they took into consideration every single movement for     pages. And in the last paragraph of the book  it's a kind of stylistic mark  because normally Charles Darwin stored  in the last paragraph of a book  the most important message. He wrote that   It's hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radical acts like the brain of one of the lower animals.  This is not a metaphor. He wrote some very interesting letters to one of his friends who was J.D. Hooker  or at that time  president of the Royal Society  so the maximum scientific authority in Britain speaking about the brain in the plants. Now  this is a root apex growing against a slope. So you can recognize this kind of movement  the same movement that worms  snakes and every animal that are moving on the ground without legs is able to display. And it's not an easy movement because  to have this kind of movement  you need to move different regions of the root and to synchronize these different regions without having a brain. So we studied the root apex and we found that there is a specific region that is here  depicted in blue    that is called the  transition zone.  And this region  it's a very small region    it's less than one millimeter. And in this small region you have the highest consumption of oxygen in the plants and more important  you have these kinds of signals here. The signals that you are seeing here are action potential  are the same signals that the neurons of my brain  of our brain  use to exchange information. Now we know that a root apex has just a few hundred cells that show this kind of feature  but we know how big the root apparatus of a small plant  like a plant of rye. We have almost    million roots. We have    and a half million root apex and a total length of     or more kilometers and a very high surface area. Now let's imagine that each single root apex is working in network with all the others. Here were have on the left  the Internet and on the right  the root apparatus. They work in the same way. They are a network of small computing machines  working in networks. And why are they so similar  Because they evolved for the same reason  to survive predation. They work in the same way. So you can remove    percent of the root apparatus and the plants  continue  to work. You can remove    percent of the Internet and it is  continuing  to work. So  a suggestion for the people working with networks  plants are able to give you good suggestions about how to evolve networks. And another possibility is a technological possibility. Let's imagine that we can build robots and robots that are inspired by plants. Until now  the man was inspired just by man or the animals in producing a robot. We have the animaloid    and the normal robots inspired by animals  insectoid  so on. We have the androids that are inspired by man. But why have we not any plantoid  Well  if you want to fly  it's good that you look at birds    to be inspired by birds. But if you want to explore soils  or if you want to colonize new territory  to best thing that you can do is to be inspired by plants that are masters in doing this. We have another possibility we are working  on  in our lab   which  is to build hybrids. It's much more easy to build hybrids. Hybrid means it's something that's half living and half machine. It's much more easy to work with plants than with animals. They have computing power  they have electrical signals. The connection with the machine is much more easy  much more even ethically possible. And these are three possibilities that we are working on to build hybrids  driven by algae or by the leaves at the end  by the most  most powerful parts of the plants  by the roots. Well  thank you for your attention. And before I finish  I would like to reassure that no snails were harmed in making this presentation. Thank you. One of my favorite parts of my job at the Gates Foundation is that I get to travel to the developing world  and I do that quite regularly. And when I meet the mothers in so many of these remote places  I'm really struck by the things that we have in common. They want what we want for our children and that is for their children to grow up successful  to be healthy  and to have a successful life. But I also see lots of poverty  and it's quite jarring  both in the scale and the scope of it. My first trip in India  I was in a person's home where they had dirt floors  no running water  no electricity  and that's really what I see all over the world. So in short  I'm startled by all the things that they don't have. But I am surprised by one thing that they do have  Coca Cola. Coke is everywhere. In fact  when I travel to the developing world  Coke feels ubiquitous. And so when I come back from these trips  and I'm thinking about development  and I'm flying home and I'm thinking   We're trying to deliver condoms to people or vaccinations   you know  Coke's success kind of stops and makes you wonder  how is it that they can get Coke to these far flung places  If they can do that  why can't governments and NGOs do the same thing  And I'm not the first person to ask this question. But I think  as a community  we still have a lot to learn. It's staggering  if you think about Coca Cola. They sell  .  billion servings every single day. That's like every man  woman and child on the planet having a serving of Coke every week. So why does this matter  Well  if we're going to speed up the progress and go even faster on the set of Millennium Development Goals that we're set as a world  we need to learn from the innovators  and those innovators come from every single sector. I feel that  if we can understand what makes something like Coca Cola ubiquitous  we can apply those lessons then for the public good. Coke's success is relevant  because if we can analyze it  learn from it  then we can save lives. So that's why I took a bit of time to study Coke. And I think there are really three things we can take away from Coca Cola. They take real time data and immediately feed it back into the product. They tap into local entrepreneurial talent  and they do incredible marketing. So let's start with the data. Now Coke has a very clear bottom line    they report to a set of shareholders  they have to turn a profit. So they take the data  and they use it to measure progress. They have this very continuous feedback loop. They learn something  they put it back into the product  they put it back into the market. They have a whole team called  Knowledge and Insight.  It's a lot like other consumer companies. So if you're running Namibia for Coca Cola  and you have a     constituencies  you know where every can versus bottle of Sprite  Fanta or Coke was sold  whether it was a corner store  a supermarket or a pushcart. So if sales start to drop  then the person can identify the problem and address the issue. Let's contrast that for a minute to development. In development  the evaluation comes at the very end of the project. I've sat in a lot of those meetings  and by then  it is way too late to use the data. I had somebody from an NGO once describe it to me as bowling in the dark. They said   You roll the ball  you hear some pins go down. It's dark  you can't see which one goes down until the lights come on  and then you an see your impact.  Real time data turns on the lights. So what's the second thing that Coke's good at  They're good at tapping into that local entrepreneurial talent. Coke's been in Africa since       but most of the time they couldn't reach the distant markets  because they had a system that was a lot like in the developed world  which was a large truck rolling down the street. And in Africa  the remote places  it's hard to find a good road. But Coke noticed something    they noticed that local people were taking the product  buying it in bulk and then reselling it in these hard to reach places. And so they took a bit of time to learn about that. And they decided in      that they wanted to start training the local entrepreneurs  giving them small loans. They set them up as what they called micro distribution centers  and those local entrepreneurs then hire sales people  who go out with bicycles and pushcarts and wheelbarrows to sell the product. There are now some       of these centers employing about        people in Africa. In Tanzania and Uganda  they represent    percent of Coke's sales. Let's look at the development side. What is it that governments and NGOs can learn from Coke  Governments and NGOs need to tap into that local entrepreneurial talent as well  because the locals know how to reach the very hard to serve places  their neighbors  and they know what motivates them to make change. I think a great example of this is Ethiopia's new health extension program. The government noticed in Ethiopia that many of the people were so far away from a health clinic  they were over a day's travel away from a health clinic. So if you're in an emergency situation    or if you're a mom about to deliver a baby    forget it  to get to the health care center. They decided that wasn't good enough  so they went to India and studied the Indian state of Kerala that also had a system like this  and they adapted it for Ethiopia. And in       the government of Ethiopia started this new system in their own country. They trained        health extension workers to deliver care directly to the people. In just five years  their ratio went from one worker for every        people to one worker for every       people. Now  think about how this can change people's lives. Health extension workers can help with so many things  whether it's family planning  prenatal care  immunizations for the children  or advising the woman to get to the facility on time for an on time delivery. That is having real impact in a country like Ethiopia  and it's why you see their child mortality numbers coming down    percent from      to     . In Ethiopia  there are hundreds of thousands of children living because of this health extension worker program. So what's the next step for Ethiopia  Well  they're already starting talk about this. They're starting to talk about   How do you have the health community workers generate their own ideas  How do you incent them based on the impact that they're getting out in those remote villages   That's how you tap into local entrepreneurial talent and you unlock people's potential. The third component of Coke's success is marketing. Ultimately  Coke's success depends on one crucial fact and that is that people want a Coca Cola. Now the reason these micro entrepreneurs can sell or make a profit is they have to sell every single bottle in their pushcart or their wheelbarrow. So  they rely on Coca Cola in terms of its marketing  and what's the secret to their marketing  Well  it's aspirational. It is associated that product with a kind of life that people want to live. So even though it's a global company  they take a very local approach. Coke's global campaign slogan is  Open Happiness.  But they localize it. And they don't just guess what makes people happy  they go to places like Latin America and they realize that happiness there is associated with family life. And in South Africa  they associate happiness with seriti or community respect. Now  that played itself out in the World Cup campaign. Let's listen to this song that Coke created for it   Wavin' Flag  by a Somali hip hop artist.   Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh     Oh oh oh oh oh o oh     Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh o oh    Give you freedom  give you fire    Give you reason  take you higher     See the champions take the field now     You define us  make us feel proud     In the streets our heads are lifted     As we lose our inhibition     Celebration  it's around us     Every nation  all around us   Melinda French Gates  It feels pretty good  right  Well  they didn't stop there    they localized it into    different languages. And it went number one on the pop chart in    countries. It reminds me of a song that I remember from my childhood   I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing   that also went number one on the pop charts. Both songs have something in common  that same appeal of celebration and unity. So how does health and development market  Well  it's based on avoidance  not aspirations. I'm sure you've heard some of these messages.  Use a condom  don't get AIDS.   Wash you hands  you might not get diarrhea.  It doesn't sound anything like  Wavin' Flag  to me. And I think we make a fundamental mistake    we make an assumption  that we think that  if people need something  we don't have to make them want that. And I think that's a mistake. And there's some indications around the world that this is starting to change. One example is sanitation. We know that a million and a half children die a year from diarrhea and a lot of it is because of open defecation. But there's a solution  you build a toilet. But what we're finding around the world  over and over again  is  if you build a toilet and you leave it there  it doesn't get used. People reuse it for a slab for their home. They sometimes store grain in it. I've even seen it used for a chicken coop. But what does marketing really entail that would make a sanitation solution get a result in diarrhea  Well  you work with the community. You start to talk to them about why open defecation is something that shouldn't be done in the village  and they agree to that. But then you take the toilet and you position it as a modern  trendy convenience. One state in Northern India has gone so far as to link toilets to courtship. And it works    look at these headlines. I'm not kidding. Women are refusing to marry men without toilets. No loo  no  I do.  Now  it's not just a funny headline    it's innovative. It's an innovative marketing campaign. But more importantly  it saves lives. Take a look at this    this is a room full of young men and my husband  Bill. And can you guess what the young men are waiting for  They're waiting to be circumcised. Can you you believe that  We know that circumcision reduces HIV infection by    percent in men. And when we first heard this result inside the Foundation  I have to admit  Bill and I were scratching our heads a little bit and we were saying   But who's going to volunteer for this procedure   But it turns out the men do  because they're hearing from their girlfriends that they prefer it  and the men also believe it improves their sex life. So if we can start to understand what people really want in health and development  we can change communities and we can change whole nations. Well  why is all of this so important  So let's talk about what happens when this all comes together  when you tie the three things together. And polio  I think  is one of the most powerful examples. We've seen a    percent reduction in polio in    years. So if you look back to       there are about         cases of polio on the planet that year. In       we're down to       cases. Well how did that happen  Let's look at a country like India. They have over a billion people in this country  but they have        local doctors who report paralysis  and clinicians  a huge reporting system in chemists. They have two and a half million vaccinators. But let me make the story a little bit more concrete for you. Let me tell you the story of Shriram  an    month boy in Bihar  a northern state in India. This year on August  th  he felt paralysis and on the   th  his parents took him to the doctor. On August   th and   th  they took a stool sample  and by the   th of August  it was confirmed he had Type   polio. By August   th  a genetic test was done  and we knew what strain of polio Shriram had. Now it could have come from one of two places. It could have come from Nepal  just to the north  across the border  or from Jharkhand  a state just to the south. Luckily  the genetic testing proved that  in fact  this strand came north  because  had it come from the south  it would have had a much wider impact in terms of transmission. So many more people would have been affected. So what's the endgame  Well on September  th  there was a huge mop up campaign  which is what you do in polio. They went out and where Shriram lives  they vaccinated two million people. So in less than a month  we went from one case of paralysis to a targeted vaccination program. And I'm happy to say only one other person in that area got polio. That's how you keep a huge outbreak from spreading  and it shows what can happen when local people have the data in their hands  they can save lives. Now one of the challenges in polio  still  is marketing  but it might not be what you think. It's not the marketing on the ground. It's not telling the parents   If you see paralysis  take your child to the doctor or get your child vaccinated.  We have a problem with marketing in the donor community. The G  nations have been incredibly generous on polio over the last    years  but we're starting to have something called polio fatigue and that is that the donor nations aren't willing to fund polio any longer. So by next summer  we're sighted to run out of money on polio. So we are    percent of the way there on this goal and we're about to run short of money. And I think that if the marketing were more aspirational  if we could focus as a community on how far we've come and how amazing it would be to eradicate this disease  we could put polio fatigue and polio behind us. And if we could do that  we could stop vaccinating everybody  worldwide  in all of our countries for polio. And it would only be the second disease ever wiped off the face of the planet. And we are so close. And this victory is so possible. So if Coke's marketers came to me and asked me to define happiness  I'd say my vision of happiness is a mother holding healthy baby in her arms. To me  that is deep happiness. And so if we can learn lessons from the innovators in every sector  then in the future we make together  that happiness can be just as ubiquitous as Coca Cola. Thank you. I learned about the Haiti earthquake by Skype. My wife sent me a message   Whoa  earthquake   and then disappeared for    minutes. It was    minutes of absolute terror that thousands of people across the U.S. felt. I was afraid of a tsunami  what I didn't realize was there was a greater terror in Haiti  and that was building collapse. We've all seen the photos of the collapsed buildings in Haiti. These are shots my wife took a couple days after the quake  while I was making my way through the D.R. into the country. This is the national palace    the equivalent of the White House. This is the largest supermarket in the Caribbean at peak shopping time. This is a nurses' college    there are     nurses studying. The general hospital right next door emerged largely unscathed. This is the Ministry of Economics and Finance. We have all heard about the tremendous human loss in the earthquake in Haiti  but we haven't heard enough about why all those lives were lost. We haven't heard about why the buildings failed. After all  it was the buildings  not the earthquake  that killed         people  that injured          that displaced  .  million people  that cut off food and water and supplies for an entire nation. This is the largest metropolitan area disaster in decades  and it was not a natural disaster    it was a disaster of engineering. AIDG has worked in Haiti since       providing engineering and business support to small businesses. And after the quake  we started bringing in earthquake engineers to figure out why the buildings collapsed  to examine what was safe and what wasn't. Working with MINUSTAH  which is the U.N. mission in Haiti  with the Ministry of Public Works  with different NGOs  we inspected over       buildings. We inspected schools and private residencies. We inspected medical centers and food warehouses. We inspected government buildings. This is the Ministry of Justice. Behind that door is the National Judicial Archives. The fellow in the door  Andre Filitrault    who's the director of the Center for Interdisciplinary Earthquake Engineering Research at the University of Buffalo    was examining it to see if it was safe to recover the archives. Andre told me  after seeing these buildings fail again and again in the same way  that there is no new research here. There is nothing here that we don't know. The failure points were the same  walls and slabs not tied properly into columns    that's a roof slab hanging off the building    cantilevered structures  or structures that were asymmetric  that shook violently and came down  poor building materials  not enough concrete  not enough compression in the blocks  rebar that was smooth  rebar that was exposed to the weather and had rusted away. Now there's a solution to all these problems. And we know how to build properly. The proof of this came in Chile  almost a month later  when  .  magnitude earthquake hit Chile. That is     times the power of the  .  that hit Port au Prince        times the power  yet only under a thousand casualties. Adjusted for population density  that is less than one percent of the impact of the Haitian quake. What was the difference between Chile and Haiti  Seismic standards and confined masonry  where the building acts as a whole    walls and columns and roofs and slabs tied together to support each other    instead of breaking off into separate members and failing. If you look at this building in Chile  it's ripped in half  but it's not a pile of rubble. Chileans have been building with confined masonry for decades. Right now  AIDG is working with KPFF Consulting Engineers  Architecture for Humanity  to bring more confined masonry training into Haiti. This is Xantus Daniel  he's a mason  just a general construction worker  not a foreman  who took one of our trainings. On his last job he was working with his boss  and they started pouring the columns wrong. He took his boss aside  and he showed him the materials on confined masonry. He showed him   You know  we don't have to do this wrong. It won't cost us any more to do it the right way.  And they redid that building. They tied the rebar right  they poured the columns right  and that building will be safe. And every building that they build going forward will be safe. To make sure these buildings are safe  it's not going to take policy    it's going to take reaching out to the masons on the ground and helping them learn the proper techniques. Now there are many groups doing this. And the fellow in the vest there  Craig Toten  he has pushed forward to get documentation out to all the groups that are doing this. Through Haiti Rewired  through Build Change  Architecture for Humanity  AIDG  there is the possibility to reach out to                  masons across the country and create a movement of proper building. If you reach out to the people on the ground in this collaborative way it's extremely affordable. For the billions spent on reconstruction  you can train masons for dollars on every house that they end up building over their lifetime. Ultimately  there are two ways that you can rebuild Haiti  the way at the top is the way that Haiti's been building for decades. The way at the top is a poorly constructed building that will fail. The way at the bottom is a confined masonry building  where the walls are tied together  the building is symmetric  and it will stand up to an earthquake. For all the disaster  there is an opportunity here to build better houses for the next generation  so that when the next earthquake hits  it is a disaster    but not a tragedy. I was informed by this kind of unoriginal and trite idea that new technologies were an opportunity for social transformation  which is what drove me then  and still  it's a delusion that drives me now. I wanted to update what I've been doing since then    but it's still the same theme song    and introduce you to my lab and current work  which is the Environmental Health Clinic that I run at NYU. And what it is    it's a twist on health. Because  really  what I'm trying to do now is redefine what counts as health. It's a clinic like a health clinic at any other university  except people come to the clinic with environmental health concerns  and they walk out with prescriptions for things they can do to improve environmental health  as opposed to coming to a clinic with medical concerns and walking out with prescriptions for pharmaceuticals. It's a handy dandy quote from Hippocrates of the Hippocratic oath that says   The greater part of the soul lays outside the body  treatment of the inner requires treatment of the outer.  But that suggests the issue that I'm trying to get at here  that we have an opportunity to redefine what is health. Because this idea that health is internal and atomized and individual and pharmaceutical is largely an error. And I would use this study  a recent study by Philip Landrigan  to motivate a different view of health  where he went to most of the pediatricians in Manhattan and the New York area and logged what they spent their patient hours on.    to    percent of their time was spent on five things. Number one was asthma  number two was developmental delays  number three was     fold increases in rare childhood cancers in the last eight to        years. Number four and five were childhood obesity and diabetes related issues. So all of those    what's common about all of those  The environment is implicated  radically implicated  right. This is not the germs that medicos were trained to deal with  this is a different definition of health  health that has a great advantage because it's external  it's shared  we can do something about it  as opposed to internal  genetically predetermined or individualized. People who come to the clinic are called  not patients  but impatients  because they're too impatient to wait for legislative change to address local and environmental health issues. And I meet them at the University  I also have a few field offices that I set up in various places that provide an immersion in some of the environmental challenges we face. I like this one from the Belgian field office  where we met in a roundabout  precisely because the roundabout iconified the headless social movement that informs much social transformation  as opposed to the top down control of red light traffic intersections. In this case  of course  the roundabout with that micro decisions being made in situ by people not being told what to do. But  of course  affords greater throughput  fewer accidents  and an interesting model of social movement. Some of the things that the monitoring protocols have developed  this is the tadpole bureaucrat protocol  or keeping tabs  if you will. What they are is an addition of tadpoles that are named after a local bureaucrat whose decisions affect your water quality. So an impatient concerned for water quality would raise a tadpole bureaucrat in a sample of water in which they're interested. And we give them a couple of things to do that  to help them do companion animal devices while they're blogging and doing their email. This is a tadpole walker to take your tadpole walking in the evening. And the interesting thing that happens    because we're using tadpoles  of course  because they have the most exquisite biosenses that we have  several orders of magnitude more sensitive than some of our senses for sensing  responding in a biologically meaningful way  to that whole class of industrial contaminants we call endocrine disruptors or hormone emulators. But by taking your tadpole out for a walk in the evening    there's a few action shots    your neighbors are likely to say   What are you doing   And then you have to introduce your tadpole and who it's named after. You have to explain what you're doing and how the developmental events of a tadpole are  of course  very observable and they use the same T  mediated hormones that we do. And so next time your neighbor sees you they'll say   How is that tadpole doing   And you can let them social network with your tadpole  because the Environmental Health Clinic has a social networking site for  not only impatients  humans  but non humans  social networking for humans and non humans. And of course  these endocrine disruptors are things that are implicated in the breast cancer epidemic  the obesity epidemic  the two and a half year drop in the average age of onset of puberty in young girls and other related things. The culmination of this is if you've successfully raised your tadpole  observing the behavioral and developmental events  you will then go and introduce your tadpole to its namesake and discuss the evidence that you've seen. Another quick protocol    and I'm going to go through these quickly  but just to give you the material sense of what we're doing here    instead of asking you for urine samples  I'll ask you for a mouse sample. Anyone here lucky enough to share  to cohabit with a mouse    a domestic partnership with mice  Very lucky. Mice  of course  are the quintessential model organism. They're even better models of environmental health  because not only the same mammalian biology  but they share your diet  largely. They share your environmental stressors  the asbestos levels and lead levels  whatever you're exposed to. And they're geographically more limited than you are  because we don't know if you've been exposed to persistent organic pollutants in your home  or occupationally or as a child. Mice are a very good representation. So it starts by building a better mousetrap  of course. This is one of them. Coping with environmental stressors is tricky. Is anybody here on antidepressants  There's a lot of people in Manhattan are. And we were testing if the mice would also self administer SSRIs. So this was Prozac  this was Zoloft  this was a black jellybean and this was muscle relaxant  all of which were the medications that the impatient was taking. So do you think the mice self administered antidepressants  What's the     Audience  Sure. Yes.  How did you know that  They did. This was vodka and solution  gin and solution. This guy also liked plain water and the muscle relaxant. Where's our expert  Vodka  gin    Yes. Yes. You know your mice well. They did  yes. So they drank as much vodka as they did plain water  which was interesting. Then of course  it goes into the entrapment device. There's an old cellphone in there    a good use for old cellphones    which dials the clinic  we go and pick up the mouse. We take the blood sample and do the blood work and hair work on the mice. And I want to sort of point out the big advantage of framing health in this external way. But we do have a few prescription products through this. It's very different from the medical model. Anything you do to improve your water quality or air quality  or to understand it or to change it  the benefits are enjoyed by anyone you share that water quality or air quality with. And that aggregating effect  that collective action effect  is actually something we can use to our advantage. So I want to show you one prescription product in the clinic called the No Park. This is a prescription to improve water quality. Many impatients are very concerned for water quality and air quality. What we do is we take a fire hydrant  a  no parking  space associated with a fire hydrant  and we prescribe the removal of the asphalt to create an engineered micro landscape  to create an infiltration opportunity. Because  many of you will know  that the biggest pollution burden that we have on the New York  New Jersey harbor right now is no longer the point sources  no longer the big polluters  no longer the GEs  but that massive network of roads   those  impervious surfaces  that collect all that cadmium neurotoxin that comes from your brake liners or the oily hydrocarbon waste in every single storm event and medieval infrastructure washes it straight into the estuary system. That doesn't do a lot of good. These are little opportunities to intercept those pollutants before they enter the harbor  and they're produced by impatients on various city blocks in some very interesting ways. I just want to say it was sort of a rule of thumb though  there's about two or three fire hydrants on every city block. By creating engineered micro landscapes to infiltrate in them  we don't prevent them from being used as emergency vehicle parking spaces  because  of course  a firetruck can come and park there. They flatten a few plants. No big deal  they'll regenerate. But if we did this in every single    every fire hydrant we could redefine the emergency. That    percent of the time when a firetruck is not parking there  it's infiltrating pollutants. It's also increasing fixing CO s  sequestering some of the airborne pollutants. And aggregated  these smaller interceptions could actually infiltrate all the roadborne pollution that now runs into the estuary system  up to a seven inch rain event  up to a hundred year storm. So these are small actions that can amount to a significant effect to improve local environmental health. This is one of the more ambitious ones. What the climate crisis has revealed to us is a secondary  more insidious and more pervasive crisis  which is the crisis of agency  which is what to do. Somehow buying a local lettuce  changing a light bulb  driving the speed limit  changing your tires regularly  doesn't seem sufficient in the face of climate crisis. And this is an interesting icon that happened    you remember these  fallout shelters. What is the fallout shelter for the climate crisis  This was civic mobilization. Churches  school groups  hospitals  private residents    everyone built one of these in a matter of months. And they still remain as icons of civic response in the face of shared  uncertain  collective threat. Fallout shelter for the climate crisis  I would say  looks something like this  or this  which is an intensive urban agriculture facility that's due to go on my lab building at NYU. What it does is a very simple idea of taking       to    percent of the CO  produced in Manhattan is building related    we take  just like a commercial greenhouse  we take the CO  from the building    CO  enriched air    we force it through the urban agriculture facility  and then we resupply oxygen enriched air. You can't actually build much on a roof  they're not designed for that. So it's on legs  so it focuses all the load on the masonry walls and the columns. It's built as a barn raising  using open source hardware. This is the quarter scale prototype that was functioning in Spain. This is what it will look like  fingers crossed  NYU willing. And what I want to show you is    actually this is one of the components of it that we've just recently been testing    which is a solar chimney    we have got    of them now put around New York at the moment    that passively draws air up. You understand a solar chimney. Hot air rises. You put a bit of black plastic on the side of a building  it'll heat up  and you'll get passive airflow. What we do is actually put a standard HVAC filter on the top of that. That actually removes about    percent of the carbon black  that stuff that  with ozone  is responsible for about half of global warming's effects  because it changes  it settles on the snow  it changes the reflectors  it changes the transmission qualities of the atmosphere. Carbon black is that grime that otherwise lodges in your pretty pink lungs  and it's associated with. It's not good stuff  and it's from inefficient combustion  not from combustion itself. When we put it through our solar chimney  we remove actually about    percent of that. And then I swap it out with the students and actually re release that carbon black. And we make pencils the length of which measures the grime that we've pulled out of the air. Here's one of them that we have up now. Here's who put them up and who are avid pencil users. Okay  so I want to show you just two more interfaces  because I think one of our big challenges is re imagining our relationship to natural systems  not only through this model of twisted personalized health  but through the animals with whom we cohabit. We are not alone  the animals are moving in. In fact  urban migration now describes the movement of animals formerly known as wild into urban centers. You know  coyote in Central Park  a whale in the Gowanus Canal  elk in Westchester County. It's happening all over the Developed World  probably for loss of habitat  but also because our cities are a little bit more livable than they have been. And every green space we create is an invitation for non humans to cohabit with us. But we've kind of lacked imagination in how we could do that well or interestingly. And I want to show you a few of the technological interfaces that have been developed under the moniker of OOZ    which is zoo backwards and without cages    to try and reform that relationship. This is communication technology for birds. It looks like this. When a bird lands on it  they trigger a sound file. This is actually in the Whitney Museum  where there were six of them  each of which had a different argument on it  different sound file. They said things like this. Recorded Voice  Here's what you need to do. Go down there and buy some of those health food bars  the ones you call bird food  and bring it here and scatter it around. There's a good person. Natalie Jeremijenko  Okay.  Laugher  So there was several of these. The birds were able to jump from one to the other. These are just your average urban pigeon. And an early test which argument elicited cooperative behavior from the people below    about a hundred to one decided that this was the argument that worked best on us. Recorded Voice  Tick  tick  tick. That's the sound of genetic mutations of the avian flu becoming a deadly human flu. Do you know what slows it down  Healthy sub populations of birds  increasing biodiversity generally. It is in your interests that I'm healthy  happy  well fed. Hence  you could share some of your nutritional resources instead of monopolizing them. That is  share your lunch. NJ  It worked  and it's true. The final project I'd like to show you is a new interface for fish that has just been launched    it's actually officially launched next week    with a wonderful commission from the Architectural League. You may not have known that you need to communicate with fish  but there is now a device for you to do so. It looks like this  buoys that float on the water  project three foot up  three foot down. When a fish swims underneath  a light goes on. This is what it looks like. So there's another function on here. This top light is    I'm sorry if I'm making you seasick    this top light is actually a water quality display that shifts from red  when the dissolved oxygen is low  to a blue green  when its dissolved oxygen is high. And then you can also text the fish. So there's business cards down there that'll give you contact details. And they text back. When the buoys get your text  they wink at you twice to say  we've got your message. But perhaps the most popular has been that we've got another array of these boys in the Bronx River  where the first beaver    crazy as he is    to have moved in and built a lodge in New York in     years  hangs out. So updates from a beaver. You can subscribe to updates from him. You can talk to him. And what I like to think of is this is an interface that re scripts how we interact with natural systems  specifically by changing who has information  where they have it  who can make sense of that information  and what you can do about it. In this case  instead of throwing chewing gum  or Doritos or whatever you have in your pocket at the fish    There's a body of water in Iceland that I've been dealing with that's in the middle of the city  and the largest pollution burden on it is not the roadborne pollution  it's actually white bread from people feeding the fish and the birds. Instead of doing that actually  we've developed some fish sticks that you can feed the fish. They're delicious. They're cross species delicious that is  delicious for humans and non humans. But they also have a chelating agent in them. They're nutritionally appropriate  not like Doritos. And so every time that desire to interact with the animals  which is at least as ubiquitous as that sign   Do not feed the animals.  And there's about three of them on every New York City park. And Yellowstone National Park  there's more  do not feed the animals  signs than there are animals you might wish to feed. But in that action  that interaction  by re scripting that  by changing it into an opportunity to offer food that is nutritionally appropriate  that could augment the nutritional resources that we ourselves have depleted for augmenting the fish population and also adding chelating agent  which  like any chelating agent that we use medicinally  binds to the bioaccumulated heavy metals and PCBs that are in the fish living in this particular habitat and allows them to pass it out as a harmless salt where it's complexed by a reactive  effectively removing it from bioavailability. But I wanted to say that interaction  re scripting that interaction  into collective action  collective remediative action  very different from the approach that's being used on the other side on the Hudson River  where we're dredging the PCBs    after    years of legislative and legal struggle  GE's paying for the dredging of the largest Superfund site in the world    we're dredging it  and it'll probably get shipped off to Pennsylvania or the nearest Third World country  where it will continue to be toxic sludge. Displacement is not the way to deal with environmental issues. And that's typically the paradigm under which we've operated. By actually taking the opportunity that new technologies  new interactive technologies  present to re script our interactions  to script them  not just as isolated  individuated interactions  but as collective aggregating actions that can amount to something  we can really begin to address some of our important environmental challenges. Thank you. Every presentation needs this slide in it. It's beautiful  isn't it  Do you see  All the points  all the lines    it's incredible. It is the network  and in my case  the network has been important in media  because I get to connect to people. Isn't it amazing  Through that  I connect to people. And the way that I've been doing it has been multifaceted. For example  I get people to dress up their vacuum cleaners. I put together projects like Earth Sandwich  where I ask people to try and simultaneously place two pieces of bread perfectly opposite each other on the Earth. And people started laying bread in tribute  and eventually a team was able to do it between New Zealand and Spain. It's pretty incredible    the video's online. Connecting to people in projects like YoungmeNowme for example. In YoungmeNowme  the audience was asked to find a childhood photograph of themselves and restage it as an adult. This is the same person    top photo  James  bottom photo   Jennifer . Poignant. This was a Mother's Day gift. Particularly creepy. My favorite of these photos  which I couldn't find  is there's a picture of a    year old woman or so with a little baby on her lap  and the next photo is a     lb man with a tiny  little old lady peaking over his shoulder. But this project changed the way that I thought about connecting to people. This is project called Ray. And what happened was I was sent this piece of audio and had no idea who generated the audio. Somebody said   You have to listen to this.  And this is what came to me. Recording  Hi  my name is Ray  and on yesterday my daughter called me because she was stressed out because of things that were going on on her job that she felt was quite unfair. Being quite disturbed  she called for comfort  and I didn't really know what to tell her  because we have to deal with so much mess in our society. So I was led to write this song just for her  just to give her some encouragement while dealing with stress and pressures on her job. And I figured I'd put it on the Internet for all employees under stress to help you better deal with what you're going through on your job. Here's how the song goes.   I'm about to whip somebody's ass     Oh  I'm about to whip somebody's ass     Oh  if you don't leave me alone      you gonna have to send me home     'Cause I'm about to whip somebody's ass   Now you might not be able to sing that out loud  but you can hum it to yourself  and you know what the words are. And let it give you some strength to get the next few moments on your job. All right. Stay strong. Peace. Ze Frank  So    yeah. No  no  no  shush. We've got to go quickly. So I was so moved by this    this is incredible. This was connecting  right. This was  at a distance  realizing that someone was feeling something  wanting to affect them in a particular way  using media to do it  putting it online and realizing that there was a greater impact. This was incredible  this is what I wanted to do. So the first thing I thought of is we have to thank him. And I asked my audience  I said   Listen to this piece of audio. We have to remix it. He's got a great voice. It's actually in the key of B flat. And have to do something with it.  Hundreds of remixes came back    lots of different attempts. One stood out in particular. It was done by a guy named Goose. Remix    I'm about to whip somebody's ass     Oh  I'm about to whip somebody's ass     Oh  if you don't leave me alone      You gonna have to send me home     Cuz I'm about to whip somebody's ass     I'm about to whip some      ZF  Great  so it was incredible. That song     Applause  Thank you. So that song  somebody told me that it was at a baseball game in Kansas City. In the end  it was one of the top downloads on a whole bunch of music streaming services. And so I said   Let's put this together in an album.  And the audience came together  and they designed an album cover. And I said   If you put it all on this  I'm going to deliver it to him  if you can figure out who this person is   because all I had was his name    Ray    and this little piece of audio and the fact that his daughter was upset. In two weeks  they found him. I received and email and it said   Hi  I'm Ray. I heard you were looking for me.  And I was like   Yeah  Ray. It's been an interesting two weeks.  And so I flew to St. Louis and met Ray  and he's a preacher    among other things. So but anyways  here's the thing    is it reminds me of this  which is a sign that you see in Amsterdam on every street corner. And it's sort of a metaphor for me for the virtual world. I look at this photo  and he seems really interested in what's going on with that button  but it doesn't seem like he is really that interested in crossing the street. And it makes me think of this. On street corners everywhere  people are looking at their cell phones  and it's easy to dismiss this as some sort of bad trend in human culture. But the truth is life is being lived there. When they smile    right  you've seen people stop    all of a sudden  life is being lived there  somewhere up in that weird  dense network. And this is it  right  to feel and be felt. It's the fundamental force that we're all after. We can build all sorts of environments to make it a little bit easier  but ultimately  what we're trying to do is really connect with one other person. And that's not always going to happen in physical spaces. It's also going to now happen in virtual spaces  and we have to get better at figuring that out. I think  of the people that build all this technology in the network  a lot of them aren't very good at connecting with people. This is kind of like something I used to do in third grade. So here's a series of projects over the last few years where I've been inspired by trying to figure out how to really facilitate close connection. Sometimes they're very  very simple things. A Childhood Walk  which is a project where I ask people to remember a walk that they used to take as a child over and over again that was sort of meaningless    like on the route to the bus stop  to a neighbor's house  and take it inside of Google Streetview. And I promise you  if you take that walk inside Google Streetview  you come to a moment where something comes back and hits you in the face. And I collected those moments    the photos inside Google Streetview and the memories  specifically.  Our conversation started with me saying  'I'm bored ' and her replying  'When I'm bored I eat pretzels.' I remember this distinctly because it came up a lot.   Right after he told me and my brother he was going to be separating from my mom  I remember walking to a convenience store and getting a cherry cola.   They used some of the morbidly artist footage  a close up of Chad's shoes in the middle of the highway. I guess the shoes came off when he was hit. He slept over at my house once  and he left his pillow. It had 'Chad' written in magic marker on it. He died long after he left the pillow at my house  but we never got around to returning it.  Sometimes they're a little bit more abstract. This is Pain Pack. Right after September   th  last year  I was thinking about pain and the way that we disperse it  the way that we excise it from our bodies. So what I did is I opened up a hotline    a hotline where people could leave voicemails of their pain  not necessarily related to that event. And people called in and left messages like this. Recording  Okay  here's something. I'm not alone  and I am loved. I'm really fortunate. But sometimes I feel really lonely. And when I feel that way even the smallest act of kindness can make me cry. Like even people in convenience stores saying   Have a nice day   when they're accidentally looking me in the eye. ZF  So what I did was I took those voicemails  and with their permission  converted them to MP s and distributed them to sound editors who created short sounds using just those voicemails. And those were then distributed to DJs who have made hundreds of songs using that source material. We don't have time to play much of it. You can look at it online.  From    to    with love  was a project around the time of the last election cycle  where McCain and Obama both  in their speeches after the election  talked about reconciliation  and I was like   What the hell does that look like   So I thought   Well let's just give it a try. Let's have people hold up signs about reconciliation.  And so some really nice things came together.  I voted blue. I voted red. Together  for our future.  These are very  very cute little things right. Some came from the winning party.  Dear     I promise to listen to you  to fight for you  to respect you always.  Some came from the party who had just lost.  From a    to a     may your party's leadership be as classy as you  but I doubt it.  But the truth was that as this start becoming popular  a couple rightwing blogs and some message boards apparently found it to be a little patronizing  which I could also see. And so I started getting amazing amounts of hate mail  death threats even. And one guy in particular kept on writing me these pretty awful messages  and he was dressed as Batman. And he said   I'm dressed as Batman to hide my identity.  Just in case I thought the real Batman was coming after me  which actually made me feel a little better    like   Phew  it's not him.  So what I did    unfortunately  I was harboring all this kind of awful experience and this pain inside of me  and it started to eat away at my psyche. And I was protecting the project from it  I realized. I was protecting it    I didn't want this special  little group of photographs to get sullied in some way. So what I did  I took all those emails  and I put them together into something called Angrigami  which was an origami template made out of this sort of vile stuff. And I asked people to send me beautiful things made out of the Angrigami. But this was the emotional moment. One of my viewer's uncles died on a particular day and he chose to commemorate it with a piece of hate. It's amazing. The last thing I'm going to tell you about is a series of projects called Songs You Already Know  where the idea was  I was trying to figure out to address particular kinds of emotions with group projects. So one of them was fairly straightforward. A guy said that his daughter got scared at night and could I write a song for her  his daughter. And I said   Oh yeah  I'll try to write a mantra that she can sing to herself to help herself go to sleep.  And this was  Scared.    I don't know why but it helps me get over it     The words of the song just move me along     And somehow I get over it     At least I don't suck at life     I keep on trying despite     At least I don't suck at life     I keep on trying despite     This is a song that I sing when I'm scared of something   Okay  so I wrote that song  right. Thank you. So the nice thing was is he walked by his daughter's room at some point  and she actually was singing that song to herself. So I was like   Awesome. This is great.  And then I got this email. And there's a little bit of a back story to this. And I don't have much time. But the idea was that at one point I did a project called Facebook Me Equals You  where I wanted to experience what it was like to live as another person. So I asked for people's usernames and passwords to be sent to me. And I got a lot  like    in a half an hour. And I shut that part down. And I chose two people to be  and I asked them to send me descriptions of how to act as them on Facebook. One person sent me a very detailed description  the other person didn't. And the person who didn't  it turned out  had just moved to a new city and taken on a new job. So  you know  people were writing me and saying   How's your new job   I was like   I don't know. Didn't know I had one.  But anyway  this same person  Laura  ended up emailing me a little bit after that project. And I felt badly for not having done a good job. And she said   I'm really anxious  I just moved to a new town  I have this new job  and I've just had this incredible amount of anxiety.  So she had seen the  Scared  song and wondered if I could do something. So I asked her   What does it feel like when you feel this way   And she wrote a sort of descriptive set of what it felt like to have had this anxiety. And so what I decided to do. I said   Okay  I'll think about it.  And so quietly in the background  I started sending people this.   You're okay     You'll be fine   So I asked people whether they had basic audio capabilities  just so they could sing along to the song with headphones on  so I could just get their voices back. And this is the kind of thing that I got back. Recording    Hey     You're okay     You'll be fine   ZF  So that's one of the better ones  really. But what's awesome is  as I started getting more and more and more of them  all of a sudden I had        voices from around the world. And when you put them together  something magical happens  something absolutely incredible happens  and all of a sudden I get a chorus from around the world. And what was really great is  I'm putting all this work together in the background  and Laura sent me a follow up email because a good month had passed by. And she said   I know you've forgotten about me. I just want to say thanks for even considering it.  And then a few days later I sent her this.   And things that looked so good yesterday     are now shades of gray     And it seems like the world is spinning     while I'm standing still     Or maybe I am spinning I can't tell     And then you say     Hey     You're okay     You'll be fine     Just breathe     And now the words sing     Hey     You're okay     You'll be fine     Just breathe     Now everybody sings     Hey     You're okay     You'll be fine     Just breathe     Hey     You're okay     You'll be fine     Just breathe     Hey     You're okay     You'll be fine     Just breathe   Thank you. The stories we tell about each other matter very much. The stories we tell ourselves about our own lives matter. And most of all  I think the way that we participate in each other's stories is of deep importance. I was six years old when I first heard stories about the poor. Now I didn't hear those stories from the poor themselves  I heard them from my Sunday school teacher and Jesus  kind of via my Sunday school teacher. I remember learning that people who were poor needed something material    food  clothing  shelter    that they didn't have. And I also was taught  coupled with that  that it was my job    this classroom full of five and six year old children    it was our job  apparently  to help. This is what Jesus asked of us. And then he said   What you do for the least of these  you do for me.  Now I was pretty psyched. I was very eager to be useful in the world    I think we all have that feeling. And also  it was kind of interesting that God needed help. That was news to me  and it felt like it was a very important thing to get to participate in. But I also learned very soon thereafter that Jesus also said  and I'm paraphrasing  the poor would always be with us. This frustrated and confused me  I felt like I had been just given a homework assignment that I had to do  and I was excited to do  but no matter what I would do  I would fail. So I felt confused  a little bit frustrated and angry  like maybe I'd misunderstood something here. And I felt overwhelmed. And for the first time  I began to fear this group of people and to feel negative emotion towards a whole group of people. I imagined in my head  a kind of long line of individuals that were never going away  that would always be with us. They were always going to ask me to help them and give them things  which I was excited to do  but I didn't know how it was going to work. And I didn't know what would happen when I ran out of things to give  especially if the problem was never going away. In the years following  the other stories I heard about the poor growing up were no more positive. For example  I saw pictures and images frequently of sadness and suffering. I heard about things that were going wrong in the lives of the poor. I heard about disease  I heard about war    they always seemed to be kind of related. And in general  I got this sort of idea that the poor in the world lived lives that were wrought with suffering and sadness  devastation  hopelessness. And after a while  I developed what I think many of us do  is this predictable response  where I started to feel bad every time I heard about them. I started to feel guilty for my own relative wealth  because I wasn't doing more  apparently  to make things better. And I even felt a sense of shame because of that. And so naturally  I started to distance myself. I stopped listening to their stories quite as closely as I had before. And I stopped expecting things to really change. Now I still gave    on the outside it looked like I was still quite involved. I gave of my time and my money  I gave when solutions were on sale. The cost of a cup of coffee can save a child's life  right. I mean who can argue with that  I gave when I was cornered  when it was difficult to avoid and I gave  in general  when the negative emotions built up enough that I gave to relieve my own suffering  not someone else's. The truth be told  I was giving out of that place  not out of a genuine place of hope and excitement to help and of generosity. It became a transaction for me  became sort of a trade. I was purchasing something    I was buying my right to go on with my day and not necessarily be bothered by this bad news. And I think the way that we go through that sometimes can  first of all  disembody a group of people  individuals out there in the world. And it can also turn into a commodity  which is a very scary thing. So as I did this  and as I think many of us do this  we kind of buy our distance  we kind of buy our right to go on with our day. I think that exchange can actually get in the way of the very thing that we want most. It can get in the way of our desire to really be meaningful and useful in another person's life and  in short to love. Thankfully  a few years ago  things shifted for me because I heard this gentleman speak  Dr. Muhammad Yunus. I know many in the room probably know exactly who he is  but to give the shorthand version for any who have not heard him speak  Dr. Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago for his work pioneering modern microfinance. When I heard him speak  it was three years before that. But basically  microfinance    if this is new to you as well    think of that as financial services for the poor. Think of all the things you get at your bank and imagine those products and services tailored to the needs of someone living on a few dollars a day. Dr. Yunus shared his story  explaining what that was  and what he had done with his Grameen Bank. He also talked about  in particular  microlending  which is a tiny loan that could help someone start or grow a business. Now  when I heard him speak  it was exciting for a number of reasons. First and foremost  I learned about this new method of change in the world that  for once  showed me  maybe  a way to interact with someone and to give  to share of a resource in a way that wasn't weird and didn't make me feel bad    that was exciting. But more importantly  he told stories about the poor that were different than any stories I had heard before. In fact  those individuals he talked about who were poor was sort of a side note. He was talking about strong  smart  hardworking entrepreneurs who woke up every day and were doing things to make their lives and their family's lives better. All they needed to do that more quickly and to do it better was a little bit of capital. It was an amazing sort of insight for me. And I  in fact  was so deeply moved by this    it's hard to express now how much that affected me    but I was so moved that I actually quit my job a few weeks later  and I moved to East Africa to try to see for myself what this was about. For the first time  actually  in a long time I wanted to meet those individuals  I wanted to meet these entrepreneurs  and see for myself what their lives were actually about. So I spent three months in Kenya  Uganda and Tanzania interviewing entrepreneurs that had received     dollars to start or grow a business. And in fact  through those interactions  for the first time  I was starting to get to be friends with some of those people in that big amorphous group out there that was supposed to be far away. I was starting to be friends and get to know their personal stories. And over and over again  as I interviewed them and spent my days with them  I did hear stories of life change and amazing little details of change. So I would hear from goat herders who had used that money that they had received to buy a few more goats. Their business trajectory would change. They would make a little bit more money  their standard of living would shift and would get better. And they would make really interesting little adjustments in their lives  like they would start to send their children to school. They might be able to buy mosquito nets. Maybe they could afford a lock for the door and feel secure. Maybe it was just that they could put sugar in their tea and offer that to me when I came as their guest and that made them feel proud. But there were these beautiful details  even if I talked to    goat herders in a row  and some days that's what happened    these beautiful details of life change that were meaningful to them. That was another thing that really touched me. It was really humbling to see for the first time  to really understand that even if I could have taken a magic wand and fixed everything  I probably would have gotten a lot wrong. Because the best way for people to change their lives is for them to have control and to do that in a way that they believe is best for them. So I saw that and it was very humbling. Anyway  another interesting thing happened while I was there. I never once was asked for a donation  which had kind of been my mode  right. There's poverty  you give money to help    no one asked me for a donation. In fact  no one wanted me to feel bad for them at all. If anything  they just wanted to be able to do more of what they were doing already and to build on their own capabilities. So what I did hear  once in a while  was that people wanted a loan    I thought that sounded very reasonable and really exciting. And by the way  I was a philosophy and poetry major in school  so I didn't know the difference between profit and revenue when I went to East Africa. I just got this impression that the money would work. And my introduction to business was in these      little infuses of capital. And I learned about profit and revenue  about leverage  all sorts of things  from farmers  from seamstresses  from goat herders. So this idea that these new stories of business and hope might be shared with my friends and family  and through that  maybe we could get some of the money that they needed to be able to continue their businesses as loans  that's this little idea that turned into Kiva. A few months later  I went back to Uganda with a digital camera and a basic website that my partner  Matthew  and I had kind of built  and took pictures of seven of my new friends  posted their stories  these stories of entrepreneurship  up on the website  spammed friends and family and said   We think this is legal. Haven't heard back yet from SEC on all the details  but do you say  do you want to help participate in this  provide the money that they need   The money came in basically overnight. We sent it over to Uganda. And over the next six months  a beautiful thing happened  the entrepreneurs received the money  they were paid  and their businesses  in fact  grew  and they were able to support themselves and change the trajectory of their lives. In October of '    after those first seven loans were paid  Matt and I took the word beta off of the site. We said   Our little experiment has been a success. Let's start for real.  That was our official launch. And then that first year  October '   through '    Kiva facilitated          in loans. The second year  it was a total of    million. The third year  the total was up to around   . The fourth year  we were just short of    . And today  less than five years in  Kiva's facilitated more than     million dollars  in little    dollar bits  from lenders and entrepreneurs    more than a million of those  collectively in     countries. So that's where Kiva is today  just to bring you right up to the present. And while those numbers and those statistics are really fun to talk about and they're interesting  to me  Kiva's really about stories. It's about retelling the story of the poor  and it's about giving ourselves an opportunity to engage that validates their dignity  validates a partnership relationship  not a relationship that's based on the traditional sort of donor beneficiary weirdness that can happen. But instead a relationship that can promote respect and hope and this optimism that together we can move forward. So what I hope is that  not only can the money keep flowing forth through Kiva    that's a very positive and meaningful thing    but I hope Kiva can blur those lines  like I said  between the traditional rich and poor categories that we're taught to see in the world  this false dichotomy of us and them  have and have not. I hope that Kiva can blur those lines. Because as that happens  I think we can feel free to interact in a way that's more open  more just and more creative  to engage with each other and to help each other. Imagine how you feel when you see somebody on street who is begging and you're about to approach them. Imagine how you feel  and then imagine the difference when you might see somebody who has a story of entrepreneurship and hard work who wants to tell you about their business. Maybe they're smiling  and they want to talk to you about what they've done. Imagine if you're speaking with somebody who's growing things and making them flourish  somebody who's using their talents to do something productive  somebody who's built their own business from scratch  someone who is surrounded by abundance  not scarcity  who's in fact creating abundance  somebody with full hands with something to offer  not empty hands asking for you to give them something. Imagine if you could hear a story you didn't expect of somebody who wakes up every day and works very  very hard to make their life better. These stories can really change the way that we think about each other. And if we can catalyze a supportive community to come around these individuals and to participate in their story by lending a little bit of money  I think that can change the way we believe in each other and each other's potential. Now for me  Kiva is just the beginning. And as I look forward to what is next  it's been helpful to reflect on the things I've learned so far. The first one is  as I mentioned  entrepreneurship was a new idea to me. Kiva borrowers  as I interviewed them and got to know them over the last few years  have taught me what entrepreneurship is. And I think  at its core  it's deciding that you want your life to be better. You see an opportunity and you decide what you're going to do to try to seize that. In short  it's deciding that tomorrow can better than today and going after that. Second thing that I've learned is that loans are a very interesting tool for connectivity. So they're not a donation. Yeah  maybe it doesn't sound that much different. But in fact  when you give something to someone and they say   Thanks   and let you know how things go  that's one thing. When you lend them money  and they slowly pay you back over time  you have this excuse to have an ongoing dialogue. This continued attention    this ongoing attention    is a really big deal to build different kinds of relationships among us. And then third  from what I've heard from the entrepreneurs I've gotten to know  when all else is equal  given the option to have just money to do what you need to do  or money plus the support and encouragement of a global community  people choose the community plus the money. That's a much more meaningful combination  a more powerful combination. So with that in mind  this particular incident has led to the things that I'm working on now. I see entrepreneurs everywhere now  now that I'm tuned into this. And one thing that I've seen is there are a lot of supportive communities that already exist in the world. With social networks  it's an amazing way  growing the number of people that we all have around us in our own supportive communities  rapidly. And so  as I have been thinking about this  I've been wondering  how can we engage these supportive communities to catalyze even more entrepreneurial ideas and to catalyze all of us to make tomorrow better than today  As I've researched what's going on in the United States  a few interesting little insights have come up. So one is that  of course  as we all might expect  many small businesses in the U.S. and all over the world still need money to grow and to do more of what they want to do or they might need money during a hard month. But there's always a need for resources close by. Another thing is  it turns out  those resources don't usually come from the places you might expect    banks  venture capitalists  other organizations and support structures    they come from friends and family. Some statistics say    percent or more of funding for small businesses comes from friends and family. That's around     billion dollars a year    it's a lot. And third  so as people are doing this friends and family fundraising process  it's very awkward  people don't know exactly what to ask for  how to ask  what to promise in return  even though they have the best of intentions and want to thank those people that are supporting them. So to harness the power of these supportive communities in a new way and to allow entrepreneurs to decide for themselves exactly what that financial exchange should look like  exactly what fits them and the people around them  this week actually  we're quietly doing a launch of Profounder  which is a crowd funding platform for small businesses to raise what they need through investments from their friends and family. And it's investments  not donations  not loans  but investments that have a dynamic return. So the mapping of participating in the story  it actually flows with the up and down. So in short  it's a do it yourself tool for small businesses to raise these funds. And what you can do is go onto the site  create a profile  create investment terms in a really easy way. We make it really  really simple for me as well as anyone else who wants to use the site. And we allow entrepreneurs to share a percentage of their revenues. They can raise up to a million dollars from an unlimited number of unaccredited  unsophisticated investors    everyday people  heaven forbid    and they can share those returns over time    again  whatever terms they set. As investors choose to become involved based on those terms  they can either take their rewards back as cash  or they can decide in advance to give those returns away to a non profit. So they can be a cash  or a cause  investor. It's my hope that this kind of tool can show anybody who has an idea a path to go do what they want to do in the world and to gather the people around them that they already have  the people that know them best and that love them and want to support them  to gather them to make this happen. So that's what I'm working on now. And to close  I just want to say  look these are tools. Right now  Profounder's right at the very beginning  and it's very palpable  it's very clear to me  that it's just a vessel  it's just a tool. What we need are for people to care  to actually go use it  just like they've cared enough to use Kiva to make those connections. But the good news is I don't think I need to stand here and convince you to care    I'm not even going to try. I don't think  even though we often hear  you know  hear the ethical and moral reasons  the religious reasons   Here's why caring and giving will make you happier.  I don't think we need to be convinced of that. I think we know  in fact  I think we know so much  and it's such a reality that we care so deeply  that in fact  what usually stops us is that we're afraid to try and to mess up  because we care so very much about helping each other and being meaningful in each other's lives. So what I think I can do today  that best thing I can give you    I've given you my story  which is the best I can do. And I think I can remind us that we do care. I think we all already know that. And I think we know that love is resilient enough for us to get out there and try. Just a sec. Thanks. Thanks. For me  the best way to be inspired to try is to stop and to listen to someone else's story. And I'm grateful that I've gotten to do that here at TED. And I'm grateful that whenever I do that  guaranteed  I am inspired    I am inspired by the person I am listening to. And I believe more and more every time I listen in that that person's potential to do great things in the world and in my own potential to maybe help. And that    forget the tools  forget the moving around of resources    that stuff's easy. Believing in each other  really being sure when push comes to shove that each one of us can do amazing things in the world  that is what can make our stories into love stories and our collective story into one that continually perpetuates hope and good things for all of us. So that  this belief in each other  knowing that without a doubt and practicing that every day in whatever you do  that's what I believe will change the world and make tomorrow better than today. Thank you. This technology made a very important impact on us. It changed the way our history developed. But it's a technology so pervasive  so invisible  that we  for a long time  forgot to take it into account when we talked about human evolution. But we see the results of this technology  still. So let's make a little test. So everyone of you turns to their neighbor please. Turn and face your neighbors. Please  also on the balcony. Smile. Smile. Open the mouths. Smile  friendly. Do you    Do you see any Canine teeth  Count Dracula teeth in the mouths of your neighbors  Of course not. Because our dental anatomy is actually made  not for tearing down raw meat from bones or chewing fibrous leaves for hours. It is made for a diet which is soft  mushy  which is reduced in fibers  which is very easily chewable and digestible. Sounds like fast food  doesn't it. It's for cooked food. We carry in our face the proof that cooking  food transformation  made us what we are. So I would suggest that we change how we classify ourselves. We talk about ourselves as omnivores. I would say  we should call ourselves coctivors    from coquere  to cook. We are the animals who eat cooked food. No  no  no  no. Better    to live of cooked food. So cooking is a very important technology. It's technology. I don't know how you feel  but I like to cook for entertainment. And you need some design to be successful. So  cooking is a very important technology  because it allowed us to acquire what brought you all here  the big brain  this wonderful cerebral cortex we have. Because brains are expensive. Those have to pay tuition fees know. But it's also  metabolically speaking  expensive. You now  our brain is two to three percent of the body mass  but actually it uses    percent of the total energy we use. It's very expensive. Where does the energy come from. Of course  from food. If we eat raw food  we cannot release really the energy. So this ingenuity of our ancestors  to invent this most marvelous technology. Invisible    everyone of us does it every day  so to speak. Cooking made it possible that mutations  natural selections  our environment  could develop us. So if we think about this unleashing human potential  which was possible by cooking and food  why do we talk so badly about food  Why is it always do and don'ts and it's good for you  it's not good for you  I think the good news for me would be if we could go back and talk about the unleashing  the continuation of the unleashing of human potential. Now  cooking allowed also that we became a migrant species. We walked out of Africa two times. We populated all the ecologies. If you can cook  nothing can happen to you  because whatever you find  you will try to transform it. It keeps also your brain working. Now the very easy and simple technology which was developed actually runs after this formula. Take something which looks like food  transform it  and it gives you a good  very easy  accessible energy. This technology affected two organs  the brain and the gut  which it actually affected. The brain could grow  but the gut actually shrunk. Okay  it's not obvious to be honest. But it shrunk to    percent of primate gut of my body mass. So because of having cooked food  it's easier to digest. Now having a large brain  as you know  is a big advantage  because you can actually influence your environment. You can influence your own technologies you have invented. You can continue to innovate and invent. Now the big brain did this also with cooking. But how did it actually run this show  How did it actually interfere  What kind of criteria did it use  And this is actually taste reward and energy. You know we have up to five tastes  three of them sustain us. Sweet    energy. Umami    this is a meaty taste. You need proteins for muscles  recovery. Salty  because you need salt  otherwise your electric body will not work. And two tastes which protect you    bitter and sour  which are against poisonous and rotten material. But of course  they are hard wired but we use them still in a sophisticated way. Think about bittersweet chocolate  or think about the acidity of yogurt    wonderful    mixed with strawberry fruits. So we can make mixtures of all this kind of thing because we know that  in cooking  we can transform it to the form. Reward  this is a more complex and especially integrative form of our brain with various different elements    the external states  our internal states  how do we feel  and so on are put together. And something which maybe you don't like but you are so hungry that you really will be satisfied to eat. So satisfaction was a very important part. And as I say  energy was necessary. Now how did the gut actually participate in this development  And the gut is a silent voice    it's going more for feelings. I use the euphemism digestive comfort    actually    it's a digestive discomfort  which the gut is concerned with. If you get a stomach ache  if you get a little bit bloated  was not the right food  was not the right cooking manipulation or maybe other things went wrong. So my story is a tale of two brains  because it might surprise you  our gut has a full fledged brain. All the managers in the room say   You don't tell me something new  because we know  gut feeling. This is what we are using.  And actually you use it and it's actually useful. Because our gut is connected to our emotional limbic system  they do speak with each other and make decisions. But what it means to have a brain there is that  not only the big brain has to talk with the food  the food has to talk with the brain  because we have to learn actually how to talk to the brains. Now if there's a gut brain  we should also learn to talk with this brain. Now     years ago  anatomists described very  very carefully    here is a model of a wall of a gut. I took the three elements    stomach  small intestine and colon. And within this structure  you see these two pinkish layers  which are actually the muscle. And between this muscle  they found nervous tissues  a lot of nervous tissues  which penetrate actually the muscle    penetrate the submucosa  where you have all the elements for the immune system. The gut is actually the largest immune system  defending your body. It penetrates the mucosa. This is the layer which actually touches the food you are swallowing and you digest  which is actually the lumen. Now if you think about the gut  the gut is    if you could stretch it       meters long  the length of a tennis court. If we could unroll it  get out all the folds and so on  it would have     sq. meters of surface. And now this brain takes care over this  to move it with the muscles and to do defend the surface and  of course  digest our food we cook. So if we give you a specification  this brain  which is autonomous  have     million nerve cells      million neurons    so around the size of a cat brain  so there sleeps a little cat    thinks for itself  optimizes whatever it digests. It has    different neuron types. It's got the same diversity you find actually in a pig brain  where you have     billion neurons. It has autonomous organized microcircuits  has these programs which run. It senses the food  it knows exactly what to do. It senses it by chemical means and very importantly by mechanical means  because it has to move the food    it has to mix all the various elements which we need for digestion. This control of muscle is very  very important  because  you know  there can be reflexes. If you don't like a food  especially if you're a child  you gag. It's this brain which makes this reflex. And then finally  it controls also the secretion of this molecular machinery  which actually digests the food we cook. Now how do the two brains work with each other  I took here a model from robotics    it's called the Subsumption Architecture. What it means is that we have a layered control system. The lower layer  our gut brain  has its own goals    digestion defense    and we have the higher brain with the goal of integration and generating behaviors. Now both look    and this is the blue arrows    both look to the same food  which is in the lumen and in the area of your intestine. The big brain integrates signals  which come from the running programs of the lower brain  But subsumption means that the higher brain can interfere with the lower. It can replace  or it can inhibit actually  signals. So if we take two types of signals    a hunger signal for example. If you have an empty stomach  your stomach produces a hormone called ghrelin. It's a very big signal  it's sent to the brain says   Go and eat.  You have stop signals    we have up to eight stop signals. At least in my case  they are not listened to. So what happens if the big brain in the integration overrides the signal  So if you override the hunger signal  you can have a disorder  which is called anorexia. Despite generating a healthy hunger signal  the big brain ignores it and activates different programs in the gut. The more usual case is overeating. It actually takes the signal and changes it  and we continue  even  though  our eight signals would say   Stop  enough. We have transferred enough energy.  Now the interesting thing is that  along this lower layer    this gut    the signal becomes stronger and stronger if undigested  but digestible  material could penetrate. This we found from bariatric surgery. That then the signal would be very  very high. So now back to the cooking question and back to the design. We have learned to talk to the big brain    taste and reward  as you know. Now what would be the language we have to talk to the gut brain that its signals are so strong that the big brain cannot ignore it  Then we would generate something all of us would like to have    a balance between the hunger and the satiation. Now I give you  from our research  a very short claim. This is fat digestion. You have on your left an olive oil droplet  and this olive oil droplet gets attacked by enzymes. This is an in vitro experiment. It's very difficult to work in the intestine. Now everyone would expect that when the degradation of the oil happens  when the constituents are liberated  they disappear  they go away because they  were  absorbed. Actually  what happens is that a very intricate structure appears. And I hope you can see that there are some ring like structures in the middle image  which is water. This whole system generates a huge surface to allow more enzymes to attack the remaining oil. And finally  on your right side  you see a bubbly  cell like structure appearing  from which the body will absorb the fat. Now if we could take this language    and this is a language of structures    and make it longer lasting  that it can go through the passage of the intestine  it would generate stronger signals. So our research    and I think the research also at the universities    are now fixing on these points to say  how can we actually    and this might sound trivial now to you    how can we change cooking  How can we cook that we have this language developed  So what we have actually  it's not an omnivore's dilemma. We have a coctivor's opportunity  because we have learned over the last two million years which taste and reward    quite sophisticated to cook    to please ourselves  to satisfy ourselves. If we add the matrix  if we add the structure language  which we have to learn  when we learn it  then we can put it back  and around energy  we could generate a balance  which comes out from our really primordial operation  cooking. So  to make cooking really a very important element  I would say even philosophers have to change and have to finally recognize that cooking is what made us. So I would say  coquo ergo sum  I cook  therefore I am. Thank you very much. I'm a visual artist  and I'm also one of the co founders of the Plastic Pollution Coalition. I've been working with plastic bags  which I cut up and sew back together as my primary material for my artwork for the last    years. I turn them into two and three dimensional pieces and sculptures and installations. Upon working with the plastic  after about the first eight years  some of my work started to fissure and break down into smaller little bits of plastic. And I thought   Great. It's ephemeral just like us.  Upon educating myself a little further about plastics  I actually realized this was a bad thing. It's a bad thing that plastic breaks down into smaller little bits  because it's always still plastic. And what we're finding is that a lot of it is in the marine environment. I then  in the last few years  learned about the Pacific garbage patch and the gyre. And my initial reaction    and I think this is a lot of people's first reaction to learning about it    is   Oh my God  We've got to go out there and clean this thing up.  So I actually developed a proposal to go out with a cargo ship and two decommissioned fishing trawlers  a crane  a chipping machine and a cold molding machine. And my intention was to go out to the gyre  raise awareness about this issue and begin to pick up the plastic  chip it into little bits and cold mold it into bricks that could potentially be used as building materials in underdeveloped communities. I began talking with people who actually had been out to the gyre and were studying the plastic problem in the marine environment and upon doing so  I realized actually that cleaning it up would be a very small drop in the bucket relative to how much is being generated every day around the world  and that actually I needed to back up and look at the bigger picture. And the bigger picture is  we need to find a way to turn off the faucet. We need to cut the spigot of single use and disposable plastics  which are entering the marine environment every day on a global scale. So in looking at that  I also realized that I was really angry. I wasn't just concerned about plastic that you're trying to imagine out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean    of which I have learned there are now    gyres  potentially  of plastic in five major oceans in the world. It's not just that gyre of plastic that I'm concerned about    it's the gyre of plastic in the supermarket. I'd go to the supermarket and all of my food is packaged in plastic. All of my beverages are packaged in plastic  even at the health food market. I'm also concerned about the plastic in the refrigerator  and I'm concerned about the plastic and the toxins that leach from plastic into us and into our bodies. So I came together with a group of other people who were all looking at this issue  and we created the Plastic Pollution Coalition. We have many initiatives that we're working on  but some of them are very basic. One is  if    to    percent of what we're finding in the ocean    of the marine debris that we're finding in the ocean    is plastic  then why don't we call it what it is. It's plastic pollution. Recycling    everybody kind of ends their books about being sustainable and greening with the idea of recycling. You put something in a bin and you don't have to think about it again. What is the reality of that  In the United States  less than seven percent of our plastics are recycled. And if you really look into it  particularly when it comes to plastic bottles  most of it is only down cycled  or incinerated  or shipped to China. It is down cycled and turned into lesser things  while a glass bottle can be a glass bottle again or can be used again    a plastic bottle can never be a plastic bottle again. So this is a big issue for us. Another thing that we're looking at and asking people to think about is we've added a fourth R onto the front of the  Reduce  Reuse  Recycle   three R's  and that is refuse. Whenever possible  refuse single use and disposable plastics. Alternatives exist  some of them are very old school. I myself am now collecting these cool Pyrex containers and using those instead of Glad and Tupperware containers to store food in. And I know that I am doing a service to myself and my family. It's very easy to pick up a stainless steel bottle or a glass bottle  if you're traveling and you've forgotten to bring your stainless steel bottle and fill that up with water or filtered water  versus purchasing plastic bottled water. I guess what I want to say to everybody here    and I know that you guys know a lot about this issue    is that this is a huge problem in the oceans  but this is a problem that we've created as consumers and we can solve. We can solve this by raising awareness of the issue and teaching people to choose alternatives. So whenever possible  to choose alternatives to single use plastics. We can cut the stem    tide the stem of this into our oceans and in doing so  save our oceans  save our planet  save ourselves. Thank you.  Applause  So yeah  I'm a newspaper cartoonist    political cartoonist. I don't know if you've heard about it    newspapers  It's a sort of paper based reader. It's lighter than an iPad  it's a bit cheaper. You know what they say  They say the print media is dying    who says that  Well  the media. But this is no news  right  You've read about it already. Ladies and gentlemen  the world has gotten smaller. I know it's a cliche  but look  look how small  how tiny it has gotten. And you know the reason why  of course. This is because of technology    yeah. Any computer designers in the room  Yeah well  you guys are making my life miserable because track pads used to be round  a nice round shape. That makes a good cartoon. But what are you going to do with a flat track pad  those square things  There's nothing I can do as a cartoonist. Well  I know the world is flat now. That's true. And the Internet has reached every corner of the world  the poorest  the remotest places. Every village in Africa now has a cyber cafe. Don't go asking for a Frappuccino there. So we are bridging the digital divide. The Third World is connected  we are connected. And what happens next  Well  you've got mail. Yeah. Well  the Internet has empowered us. It has empowered you  it has empowered me and it has empowered some other guys as well. You know  these last two cartoons    I did them live during a conference in Hanoi. And they were not used to that in communist  .  Vietnam. So I was cartooning live on a wide screen    it was quite a sensation    and then this guy came to me. He was taking pictures of me and of my sketches  and I thought   This is great  a Vietnamese fan.  And as he came the second day  I thought   Wow  that's really a cartoon lover.  And on the third day  I finally understood  the guy was actually on duty. So by now  there must be a hundred pictures of me smiling with my sketches in the files of the Vietnamese police. No  but it's true  the Internet has changed the world. It has rocked the music industry  it has changed the way we consume music. For those of you old enough to remember  we used to have to go to the store to steal it. And it has changed the way your future employer will look at your application. So be careful with that Facebook account    your momma told you  be careful. And technology has set us free    this is free WiFi. But yeah  it has liberated us from the office desk. This is your life  enjoy it. In short  technology  the internet  they have changed our lifestyle. Tech guru  like this man    that a German magazine called the philosopher of the   st century    they are shaping the way we do things. They are shaping the way we consume. They are shaping our very desires. You will not like it. And technology has even changed our relationship to God. Now I shouldn't get into this. Religion and political cartoons  as you may have heard  make a difficult couple  ever since that day of       when a bunch of cartoonists in Denmark drew cartoons that had repercussions all over the world    demonstrations  fatwa  they provoked violence. People died in the violence. This was so sickening  people died because of cartoons. I mean    I had the feeling at the time that cartoons had been used by both sides  actually. They were used first by a Danish newspaper  which wanted to make a point on Islam. A Danish cartoonist told me he was one of the    who received the assignment to draw the prophet       of them refused. Did you know that  He told me   Nobody has to tell me what I should draw. This is not how it works.  And then  of course  they were used by extremists and politicians on the other side. They wanted to stir up controversy. You know the story. We know that cartoons can be used as weapons. History tells us  they've been used by the Nazis to attack the Jews. And here we are now. In the United Nations  half of the world is pushing to penalize the offense to religion    they call it the defamation of religion    while the other half of the world is fighting back in defense of freedom of speech. So the clash of civilizations is here  and cartoons are at the middle of it  This got me thinking. Now you see me thinking at my kitchen table  and since you're in my kitchen  please meet my wife. In       a few months after  I went Ivory Coast    Western Africa. Now  talk of a divided place    the country was cut in two. You had a rebellion in the North  the government in the South    the capital  Abidjan    and in the middle  the French army. This looks like a giant hamburger. You don't want to be the ham in the middle. I was there to report on that story in cartoons. I've been doing this for the last    years  it's my side job  if you want. So you see the style is different. This is more serious than maybe editorial cartooning. I went to places like Gaza during the war in     . So this is really journalism in cartoons. You'll hear more and more about it. This is the future of journalism  I think. And of course  I went to see the rebels in the north. Those were poor guys fighting for their rights. There was an ethnic side to this conflict as very often in Africa. And I went to see the Dozo. The Dozo  they are the traditional hunters of West Africa. People fear them    they help the rebellion a lot. They are believed to have magical powers. They can disappear and escape bullets. I went to see a Dozo chief  he told me about his magical powers. He said   I can chop your head off right away and bring you back to life.  I said   Well  maybe we don't have time for this right now.   Another time.  So back in Abidjan  I was given a chance to lead a workshop with local cartoonists there and I thought  yes  in a context like this  cartoons can really be used as weapons against the other side. I mean  the press in Ivory Coast was bitterly divided    it was compared to the media in Rwanda before the genocide    so imagine. And what can a cartoonist do  Sometimes editors would tell their cartoonists to draw what they wanted to see  and the guy has to feed his family  right  So the idea was pretty simple. We brought together cartoonists from all sides in Ivory Coast. We took them away from their newspaper for three days. And I asked them to do a project together  tackle the issues affecting their country in cartoons  yes  in cartoons. Show the positive power of cartoons. It's a great tool of communication for bad or for good. And cartoons can cross boundaries  as you have seen. And humor is a good way  I think  to address serious issues. And I'm very proud of what they did. I mean  they didn't agree with each other    that was not the point. And I didn't ask them to do nice cartoons. The first day  they were even shouting at each other. But they came up with a book  looking back at    years of political crisis in Ivory Coast. So the idea was there. And I've been doing projects like this  in      in Lebanon  this year in Kenya  back in January. In Lebanon  it was not a book. The idea was to have    the same principal  a divided country    take cartoonists from all sides and let them do something together. So in Lebanon  we enrolled the newspaper editors  and we got them to publish eight cartoonists from all sides all together on the same page  addressing the issue affecting Lebanon  like religion in politics and everyday life. And it worked. For three days  almost all the newspapers of Beirut published all those cartoonists together    anti government  pro government  Christian  Muslim  of course  English speaking  well  you name it. So this was a great project. And then in Kenya  what we did was addressing the issue of ethnicity  which is a poison in a lot of places in Africa. And we did video clips    you can see them if you go to YouTube Kenyatoons. So  preaching for freedom of speech is easy here  but as you have seen in contexts of repression or division  again  what can a cartoonist do  He has to keep his job. Well I believe that in any context anywhere  he always has the choice at least not to do a cartoon that will feed hatred. And that's the message I try to convey to them. I think we all always have the choice in the end not to do the bad thing. But we need to support these  unclear   critical and responsible voices in Africa  in Lebanon  in your local newspaper  in the Apple store. Today  tech companies are the world's largest editors. They decide what is too offensive or too provocative for you to see. So really  it's not about the freedom of cartoonists  it's about your freedoms. And for dictators all over the world  the good news is when cartoonists  journalists and activists shut up. Thank you. The big residual is always value for money. All the time we are trying to get value for money. What we don't look for is value for many  while we are generating value for money. Do we care about those four billion people whose income levels are less than two dollars a day  the so called bottom of the pyramid  What are the challenges in getting value for money as well as value for many  We have described here in terms of the performance and the price. If you have money  of course  you can get the value. You can get a Mercedes for a very high price  very high performance. But if you don't have money  what happens  Well  you are to ride a bicycle  carrying your own weight and also some other weight  so that you can earn the bread for the day. Well  poor do not remain poor  they become lower middle class. And if they do so  then  of course  the conditions improve  and they start riding on scooters. But the challenge is  again  they don't get much value  because they can't afford anything more than the scooter. The issue is  at that price  can you give them some extra value  A super value  in terms of their ability to ride in a car  to get that dignity  to get that safety  looks practically impossible  isn't it. Now  this is something that we see on Indian streets all the time. But many people see the same thing and think things differently  and one of them is here  Ratan Tata. The great thing about our leaders is that  should they not only have passion in their belly  which practically all of them have  they're also very innovative. An innovator is one who does not know it cannot be done. They believe that things can be done. But great leaders like Ratan have compassion. And what you said  Lakshmi  is absolutely true  it's not just Ratan Tata  it's the house of Tatas over time. Let me confirm what she said. Yes  I went barefoot until I was   . I struggled to  unclear  day was a huge issue. And when I finished my SSC  the eleventh standard  I stood eleventh among         students. But I was about to leave the school  because my poor mother couldn't afford schooling. And it was  unclear  Tata Trust  which gave me six rupees per month  almost a dollar per month for six years. That's how I'm standing before you. So that is the House of Tata. Innovation  compassion and passion. They combine all that. And it was that compassion which bothered them  because when he saw    in fact  he told me about eight or nine years ago how he was driving his own car    he drives his own car by the way    and he saw in the rain  a family like the one that I showed to you getting drenched with an infant. And then he said   Well  I must give them a car that they can afford  one lakh car         car.  Of course  as soon as you say something like this people say it is impossible  and that's what was said by Suzuki. He said  oh  probably he is going to build a three wheeler with stepney. And you can see the cartoon here. Well they didn't build that. They built a proper car. Nano. And mind you  I'm six feet half an inch  Ratan is taller than me  and we have ample space in the front and ample space in the back in this particular car. And incredible car. And of course  nothing succeeds like success  the cynics then turned around  and one after the other they also started saying   Yes  we also want to make a car in the Nano Segment. We'll manufacture a car in the Nano Segment.  How did this great story unfold  the making of Nano  Let me tell you a bit about it. For example  how we started  Ratan just began with a five engineer team  young people in their mid twenties. And he said   Well  I won't define the vehicle for you  but I will define the cost for you. It is one lakh          rupees  and you are to make it within that.  And he told them   Question the unquestionable. Stretch the envelope.  And at a point in time  he got so engrossed in the whole challenge  that he himself became a member of the team. Can you believe it  I still am told about this story of that single wiper design in which he participated. Until midnight  he'd be thinking. Early morning he'll be coming back with sort of solutions. But who was the team leader  The team leader was Girish Wagh  a    year old boy in  unclear . And the Nano team average age was just    years. And they did innovation in design and beyond. Broke many norms of the standard conventions for the first time. For example  that a two cylinder gas engine was used in a car with a single balancer shaft. Adhesives were replacing the rivets. There was a co creation  a huge co creation  with vendors and suppliers. All ideas on board were welcome.     vendors were co located adjacent to the plant  and innovative business models for automobile dealerships were developed. Imagine that a fellow who sells cloth  for example  will be selling Nano. I mean  it was incredible innovation. Seeking solutions for non auto sectors. It was an open innovation  ideas from all over were welcome. The mechanism of helicopters seats and windows was used  by the way  as well as a dashboard that was inspired by two wheelers. The fuel lines and lamps were as in two wheelers. And the crux of the matter was  however  getting more from less. All the time  you have been given an envelope. You can't cross that envelope  which is         rupees        dollars. And therefore  each component had to have a dual functionality. And the seat riser  for example  serving as a mounting for the seat as well as a structural part of the functional rigidity. Half the number of parts are contained in Nano in comparison to a typical passenger car. The length is smaller by eight percent by the way. But the current entry level cars in comparison to that is eight percent less  but    percent more inside space. And what happened was that    more from less    you can see how much more for how much less. When the Model T was launched    and this is  by the way  all the figures that are adjusted to      dollar prices    Model T was        by Ford. Volkswagon was       . And British Motor was around       . And Nano was  bang        dollars. This is why you started actually a new paradigm shift  where the same people who could not dream of sitting in a car  who were carrying their entire family in a scooter  started dreaming of being in a car. And those dreams are getting fulfilled. This is a photograph of a house and a driver and a car near my own home. The driver's name is Naran. He has bought his own Nano. And you can see  there is a physical space that has been created for him  parking that car  along with the owner's car  but more importantly  they've created a space in their mind that  Yes  my chauffeur is going to come in his own car and park it.  And that's why I call it a transformational innovation. It is not just technological  it is social innovation that we talk about. And that is where  ladies and gentlemen  this famous theme of getting more from less for more becomes important. I remember talking about this for the first time in Australia  about one and a half years ago  when their academy honored me with a fellowship. And unbelievably  in    years  I was the first Indian to be honored. And the title of my talk was therefore  Indian innovation from Gandhi to Gandhian engineering.  And I titled this more from less for more and more people as Gandhian engineering. And Gandhian engineering  in my judgment  is the one which is going to take the world forward  is going to make a difference  not just for a few  but for everyone. Let me move from mobility in a car to individual mobility for those unfortunates who have lost their legs. Here is an American citizen and his son having an artificial foot. What is its price         dollars. And of course  these feet are so designed that they can walk only on such perfect pavement or roads. Unfortunately  that's not the case in India. You can see him walk barefoot on an awkward land  sometimes in a marshy land  and so on and so forth. More importantly  they not only walk far to work  and not only do they cycle to work  but they cycle for work  as you can see here. And they climb up for their work. You have to design an artificial foot for such conditions. A challenge  of course. Four billion people  their incomes are less then two dollars a day. And if you talk about a        dollar shoe  you're talking about        days of income. You just don't have it. And therefore  you ought to look at alternatives. And that is how Jaipur Foot was created in India. It had a revolutionary prosthetic fitment and delivery system  a quick molding and modular components  enabling custom made  on the spot limb fitments. You could feel it actually in an hour  by the way  whereas the equivalent other feet took something like a day  as so on. Outer socket made by using heated high density polyethylene pipes  rather than using heated sheets. And unique high ankle design and human like looks   unclear  and functions. And I like to show how it looks and how it works. See  he jumps. You can see what stress it must have. ... above the limb  yes  it would be difficult ...  Did it hurt    No ... not at all.  ... he can run a kilometer in four minutes and    seconds ...  One kilometer in four minutes and    seconds. So that's what it is all about. And therefore Time took notice of this    dollar foot  basically. An incredible story. Let's move on to something else. I've been talking about getting more from less for more. Let's move to health. We've talked about mobility and the rest of it  let's talk about health. What's happening in the area of health  You know  you have new diseases that require new drugs. And if you look at the drug development    years ago and now  what has happened     years ago  it used to cost about a quarter billion. Today it costs  .  billion dollars. Time taken for moving a molecule to marketplace  after all the human and animal testing  was    years  now it is    years. Are you getting more drugs because you are spending more time and more money  No  I'm sorry. We used to have     now they have come down to   . So actually we are getting less from more for less and less people. Why less and less people  Because it is so expensive  so very few will be able to basically afford that. Let us just take an example. Psoriasis is very dreadful disease of the skin. The cost of treatment         dollars.       dollar antibody injections under the skin  by the way  and    of them. Time for development    it took around    years and     million dollars. Let's start in the spirit of more from less and more for more and start putting some targets. For example  we don't want        dollars  we don't have it. Can we do it  for      dollars  Time for development  not    years. We are in a hurry. Five years. Cost of development        million dollars. Sorry. I can't spend more than    million dollars. Looks absolutely audacious. Looks absolutely ridiculous. You know something  This has been achieved in India. These targets have been achieved in India. And how they have been achieved ... Sir Francis Bacon once said   When you wish to achieve results that have not been achieved before  it is an unwise fancy to think that they can be achieved by using methods that have been used before.  And therefore  the standard process  where you develop a molecule  put it into mice  into men  are not yielding those results    the billions of dollars that have been spent. The Indian cleverness was using its traditional knowledge  however  scientifically validating it and making that journey from men to mice to men  not molecule to mice to men  you know. And that is how this difference has come. And you can see this blending of traditional medicine  modern medicine  modern science. I launched a big program  unclear  CSIR about nine years ago. He is giving us not just for Psoriasis  for cancer and a whole range of things  changing the whole paradigm. And you can see this Indian Psoriasis breakthrough obtained by this reverse form of  unclear  by doing things differently. You can see before treatment and after treatment. This is really getting more from less for more and more people  because these are all affordable treatments now. Let me just remind you of what Mahatma Gandhi had said. He had said   Earth provides enough to satisfy every man's need  but not every man's greed.  So the message he was giving us was you must get more from less and less and less so that you can share it for more and more people  not only the current generation  but the future generations. And he also said   I would prize every invention of science made for the benefit for all.  So he was giving you the message that you must have it for more and more people  not just a few people. And therefore  ladies and gentlemen  this is the theme  getting more from less for more. And mind you  it is not getting just a little more for just a little less. It's not about low cost. It's about ultra low cost. You cannot say it's a mere treatment        dollars  but because you are poor I'll give it for      . Sorry  it doesn't work. You have to give it for     dollars      dollars. Is it possible  It has been made possible  by the way  for certain other different reasons. So you are not talking about low cost  you are talking about ultra low cost. You are not talking about affordability  you are talking about extreme affordability. Because of the four billion people whose income is under two dollars a day. You're not talking exclusive innovation. You're talking about inclusive innovation. And therefore  you're not talking about incremental innovation  you're talking about disruptive innovation. The ideas have to be such that you think in completely different terms. And I would also add  it is not only getting more from less for more by more and more people  the whole world working for it. I was very touched when I saw a breakthrough the other day. You know  incubators for infants  for example. They're not available in Africa. They're not available in Indian villages. And infants die. And incubator costs       dollars. And there's a    dollar incubator giving that performance that had been created. And by whom  By young students from Standford University on an extreme affordability project that they had  basically. Their heart is in the right place  like Ratan Tata. It's not just innovation  compassion and passion    compassion in the heart and passion in the belly. That's the new world that we want to create. And that is why the message is that of Gandhian engineering. Ladies and gentlemen  I'd like to end before time. I was also afraid of those    minutes. I've still one and a half to go. The message  the final message  is this  India gave a great gift to the world. What was that   In the    th century  we gave Gandhi to the world. The   st century gift  which is very  very important for the whole world  whether it is global economic meltdown  whether it is climate change    any problem that you talk about is gaining more from less for more and more    not only the current generations  for the future generations. And that can come only from Gandhian engineering. So ladies and gentlemen  I'm very happy to announce  this gift of the   st century to the world from India  Gandhian engineering. Lakshmi Pratury  Thank you  Dr. Mashelkar.  R.A. Mashelkar  Thank you very much.  LP  A quick question for you. Now  when you were a young boy in this school  what were your thoughts  like what did you think you could become  What do you think that drove you  Was there a vision you had  What is it that drove you  RAM  I'll tell you a story that drove me  that transformed my life. I remember  I went to a poor school  because my mother could not gather the    rupees  that half a dollar that was required within the stipulated time. It was  unclear  high school. But it was a poor school with rich teachers  honestly. And one of them was  unclear  who taught us physics. One day he took us out into the sun and tried to show us how to find the focal length of a convex lens. The lens was here. The piece of paper was there. He moved it up and down. And there was a bright spot up there. And then he said   This is the focal length.  But then he held it for a little while  Lakshmi. And then the paper burned. When the paper burned  for some reason he turned to me  and he said   Mashelkar  like this  if you do not diffuse your energies  if you focus your energies  you can achieve anything in the world.  That gave me a great message  focus and you can achieve. I said   Whoa  science is so wonderful  I have to become a scientist.  But more importantly  focus and you can achieve. And that message  very frankly  is valuable for society today. What does that focal length do  It has parallel lines  which are sun rays. And the property of parallel lines is that they never meet. What does that convex lens do  It makes them meet. This is convex lens leadership. You know what today's leadership is doing  Concave length. They divide them farther. So I learned the lesson of convex lens leadership from that. And when I was at National Chemical Laboratory  unclear . When I was at Council of Scientific Industry Research       laboratories    when two laboratories were not talking to each other  I would  unclear . And currently I'm president of Global Research Alliance         scientists in nine counties  right from India to the U.S. I'm trying to build a global team  which will look at the global grand challenges that the world is facing. That was the lesson. That was the inspirational moment. LP  Thank you very much.  RAM  Thank you.  I'm going to talk to you about power in this   st century. And basically  what I'd like to tell you is that power is changing  and there are two types of changes I want to discuss. One is power transition  which is change of power amongst states. And there the simple version of the message is it's moving from West to East. The other is power diffusion  the way power is moving from all states West or East to non state actors. Those two things are the huge shifts of power in our century. And I want to tell you about them each separately and then how they interact and why  in the end  there may be some good news. When we talk about power transition  we often talk about the rise of Asia. It really should be called the recovery or return of Asia. If we looked at the world in       you'd find that more than half of the world's people lived in Asia and they made more than half the world's product. Now fast forward to       half the world's people    more than half    still live in Asia  but they're now making only a fifth of the world's product. What happened  The Industrial Revolution  which meant that all of a sudden  Europe and America became the dominant center of the world. What we're going to see in the   st century is Asia gradually returning to being more than half of the world's population and more than half of the world's product. That's important and it's an important shift. But let me tell you a little bit about the other shift that I'm talking about  which is power diffusion. To understand power diffusion put this in your mind  computing and communications costs have fallen a thousandfold between      and the beginning of this century. Now that's a big abstract number. But to make it more real  if the price of an automobile had fallen as rapidly as the price of computing power  you could buy a car today for five dollars. Now when the price of any technology declines that dramatically  the barriers to entry go down. Anybody can play in the game. So in       if you wanted to communicate from Oxford to Johannesburg to New Delhi to Brasilia and anywhere simultaneously  you could do it. The technology was there. But to be able to do it  you had to be very rich    a government  a multinational corporation  maybe the Catholic Church    but you had to be pretty wealthy. Now  anybody has that capacity  which previously was restricted by price just to a few actors. If they have the price of entry into an Internet cafe    the last time I looked  it was something like a pound an hour    and if you have Skype  it's free. So capabilities that were once restricted are now available to everyone. And what that means is not that the age of the State is over. The State still matters. But the stage is crowded. The State's not alone. There are many  many actors. Some of that's good  Oxfam  a great non governmental actor. Some of it's bad  Al Qaeda  another non governmental actor. But think of what it does to how we think in traditional terms and concepts. We think in terms of war and interstate war. And you can think back to      when the government of Japan attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor. It's worth noticing that a non state actor attacking the United States in      killed more Americans than the government of Japan did in     . You might think of that as the privatization of war. So we're seeing a great change in terms of diffusion of power. Now the problem is that we're not thinking about it in very innovative ways. So let me step back and ask  what's power  Power is simple the ability to affect others to get the outcomes you want  and you can do it in three ways. You can do it with threats of coercion   sticks   you can do it with payments   carrots   or you can do it by getting others to want what you want. And that ability to get others to want what you want  to get the outcomes you want without coercion or payment  is what I call soft power. And that soft power has been much neglected and much misunderstood  and yet it's tremendously important. Indeed  if you can learn to use more soft power  you can save a lot on carrots and sticks. Traditionally  the way people thought about power was primarily in terms of military power. For example  the great Oxford historian who taught here at this university  A.J.P. Taylor  defined a great power as a country able to prevail in war. But we need a new narrative if we're to understand power in the   st century. It's not just prevailing at war  though war still persists. It's not whose army wins  it's also whose story wins. And we have to think much more in terms of narratives and whose narrative is going to be effective. Now let me go back to the question of power transition between states and what's happening there. the narratives that we use now tend to be the rise and fall of the great powers. And the current narrative is all about the rise of China and the decline of the United States. Indeed  with the      financial crisis  many people said this was the beginning of the end of American power. The tectonic plates of world politics were shifting. And president Medvedev of Russia  for example  pronounced in      this was the beginning of the end of United States power. But in fact  this metaphor of decline is often very misleading. If you look at history  in recent history  you'll see the cycles of belief in American decline come and go every    or    years or so. In       after the Soviets put up Sputnik  it was  That's the end of America.  In       with the oil embargo and the closing of the gold window  that was the end of America. In the     s  as America went through a transition in the Reagan period  between the rust belt economy of the midwest to the Silicon Valley economy of California  that was the end of America. But in fact  what we've seen is none of those were true. Indeed  people were over enthusiastic in the early     s  thinking America could do anything  which led us into some disastrous foreign policy adventures  and now we're back to decline again. The moral of this story is all these narratives about rise and fall and decline tell us a lot more about psychology than they do about reality. If we try to focus on the reality  then what we need to focus on is what's really happening in terms of China and the United States. Goldman Sachs has projected that China  the Chinese economy  will surpass that of the U.S. by     . So we've got  what     more years to go or so before China's bigger. Now someday  with a billion point three people getting richer  they are going to be bigger than the United States. But be very careful about these projections such as the Goldman Sachs projection as though that gives you an accurate picture of power transition in this century. Let me mention three reasons why it's too simple. First of all  it's a linear projection. You know  everything says  here's the growth rate of China  here's the growth rate of the U.S.  here it goes    straight line. History is not linear. There are often bumps along the road  accidents along the way. The second thing is that the Chinese economy passes the U.S. economy in  let's say        which it may it  that will be a measure of total economic size  but not of per capita income    won't tell you about the composition of the economy. China still has large areas of underdevelopment and per capita income is a better measure of the sophistication of the economy. And that the Chinese won't catch up or pass the Americans until somewhere in the latter part  after       of this century. The other point that's worth noticing is how one dimensional this projection is. You know  it looks at economic power measured by GDP. Doesn't tell you much about military power  doesn't tell you very much about soft power. It's all very one dimensional. And also  when we think about the rise of Asia  or return of Asia as I called it a little bit earlier  it's worth remembering Asia's not one thing. If you're sitting in Japan  or in New Delhi  or in Hanoi  your view of the rise of China is a little different than if you're sitting in Beijing. Indeed  one of the advantages that the Americans will have in terms of power in Asia is all those countries want an American insurance policy against the rise of China. It's as though Mexico and Canada were hostile neighbors to the United States  which they're not. So these simple projections of the Goldman Sachs type are not telling us what we need to know about power transition. But you might ask  well so what in any case  Why does it matter  Who cares  Is this just a game that diplomats and academics play  The answer is it matters quite a lot. Because  if you believe in decline and you get the answers wrong on this  the facts  not the myths  you may have policies which are very dangerous. Let me give you an example from history. The Peloponnesian War was the great conflict in which the Greek city state system tore itself apart two and a half millennia ago. What caused it  Thucydides  the great historian of the the Peloponnesian War  said it was the rise in the power of Athens and the fear it created in Sparta. Notice both halves of that explanation. Many people argue that the   st century is going to repeat the   th century  in which World War One  the great conflagration in which the European state system tore itself apart and destroyed its centrality in the world  that that was caused by the rise in the power of Germany and the fear it created in Britain. So there are people who are telling us this is going to be reproduced today  that what we're going to see is the same thing now in this century. No  I think that's wrong. It's bad history. For one thing  Germany had surpassed Britain in industrial strength by     . And as I said earlier  China has not passed the United States. But also  if you have this belief and it creates a sense of fear  it leads to overreaction. And the greatest danger we have of managing this power transition of the shift toward the East is fear. To paraphrase Franklin Roosevelt from a different context  the greatest thing we have to fear is fear itself. We don't have to fear the rise of China or the return of Asia. And if we have policies in which we take it in that larger historical perspective  we're going to be able to manage this process. Let me say a word now about the distribution of power and how it relates to power diffusion and then pull these two types together. If you ask how is power distributed in the world today  it's distributed much like a three dimensional chess game. Top board  military power among states. The United States is the only superpower  and it's likely to remain that way for two or three decades. China's not going to replace the U.S. on this military board. Middle board of this three dimensional chess game  economic power among states. Power is multi polar. There are balancers    the U.S.  Europe  China  Japan can balance each other. The bottom board of this three dimensional  the board of transnational relations  things that cross borders outside the control of governments  things like climate change  drug trade  financial flows  pandemics  all these things that cross borders outside the control of governments  there nobody's in charge. It makes no sense to call this unipolar or multi polar. Power is chaotically distributed. And the only way you can solve these problems    and this is where many greatest challenges are coming in this century    is through cooperation  through working together  which means that soft power becomes more important  that ability to organize networks to deal with these kinds of problems and to be able to get cooperation. Another way of putting it is that as we think of power in the   st century  we want to get away from the idea that power's always zero sum    my gain is your loss and vice versa. Power can also be positive sum  where your gain can be my gain. If China develops greater energy security and greater capacity to deal with its problems of carbon emissions  that's good for us as well as good for China as well as good for everybody else. So empowering China to deal with its own problems of carbon is good for everybody  and it's not a zero sum  I win  you lose. It's one in which we can all gain. So as we think about power in this century  we want to get away from this view that it's all I win  you lose. Now I don't mean to be Pollyannaish about this. Wars persist. Power persists. Military power is important. Keeping balances is important. All this still persists. Hard power is there  and it will remain. But unless you learn how to mix hard power with soft power into strategies that I call smart power  you're not going to deal with the new kinds of problems that we're facing. So the key question that we need to think about as we look at this is how do we work together to produce global public goods  things from which all of us can benefit  How do we define our national interests so that it's not just zero sum  but positive sum. In that sense  if we define our interests  for example  for the United States the way Britain defined its interests in the   th century  keeping an open trading system  keeping a monetary stability  keeping freedom of the seas    those were good for Britain  they were good for others as well. And in the   st century  you have to do an analog to that. How do we produce global public goods  which are good for us  but good for everyone at the same time  And that's going to be the good news dimension of what we need to think about as we think of power in the   st century. There are ways to define our interests in which  while protecting ourselves with hard power  we can organize with others in networks to produce  not only public goods  but ways that will enhance our soft power. So if one looks at the statements that have been made about this  I am impressed that when Hillary Clinton described the foreign policy of the Obama administration  she said that the foreign policy of the Obama administration was going to be smart power  as she put it   using all the tools in our foreign policy tool box.  And if we're going to deal with these two great power shifts that I've described  the power shift represented by transition among states  the power shift represented by diffusion of power away from all states  we're going to have to develop a new narrative of power in which we combine hard and soft power into strategies of smart power. And that's the good news I have. We can do that. Thank you very much. Sustainability represents the what  the where and the how of what is caught. The who and the why are what's important to me. I want to know the people behind my dinner choices. I want to know how I impact them. I want to know how they impact me. I want to know why they fish. I want to know how they rely on the water's bounty for their living. Understanding all of this enables us to shift our perception of seafood away from a commodity to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem. It allows for us to celebrate the seafood that we're also so fortunate to eat. So what do we call this  I think we call it restorative seafood. Where sustainability is the capacity to endure and maintain  restorative is the ability to replenish and progress. Restorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system and acknowledges our relationship with the ocean as a resource  suggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean and to encourage its resiliency. It is a more hopeful  it is a more human  and is a more useful way of understanding our environment. Wallet guides    standard issue by lots in the marine conservation world    are very handy  they're a wonderful tool. Green  yellow and red lists  of  seafood species. The association is very easy  buy green  don't buy red  think twice about yellow. But in my mind  it's really not enough to just eat green list. We can't sustain this without the measure of our success really changing the fate of the species in the yellow and the red. But what if we eat only in the green list  You've got pole caught yellowfin tuna here    comes from sustainable stocks. Pole caught    no bycatch. Great for fishermen. Lots of money. Supporting local economies. But it's a lion of the sea. It's a top predator. What's the context of this meal  Am I sitting down in a steakhouse to a    ounce portion of this  Do I do this three times a week  I might still be in the green list  but I'm not doing myself  or you  or the oceans any favors. The point is that we have to have a context  a gauge for our actions in all this. Example  I've heard that red wine is great for my health    antioxidants and minerals    heart healthy. That's great  I love red wine  I'm going to drink so much of it. I'm going to be so healthy. Well  how many bottles is it before you tell me that I have a problem  Well folks  we have a protein problem. We have lost this sensibility when it regards our food  and we are paying a cost. The problem is we are hiding that cost beneath the waves. We are hiding that cost behind the social acceptance of expanding waistlines. And we are hiding that cost behind monster profits. So the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood is that it really takes into account our needs. Restorative seafood might best be represented not by Jaws  or by Flipper  or the Gordon's fisherman  but rather  by the Jolly Green Giant. Vegetables  they might yet save the oceans. Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green. Well I'd like to respectfully submit that broccoli green might then be the new blue. We must continue to eat the best seafood possible  if at all. But we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables. The best part about restorative seafood though is that it comes on the half shell with a bottle of Tabasco and lemon wedges. It comes in a five ounce portion of tilapia breaded with Dijon mustard and crispy  broiled breadcrumbs and a steaming pile of pecan quinoa pilaf with crunchy  grilled broccoli so soft and sweet and charred and smoky on the outside with just a hint of chili flake. Whooo  This is an easy sell. And the best part is all of those ingredients are available to every family at the neighborhood Walmart. Jamie Oliver is campaigning to save America from the way we eat. Sylvia is campaigning to save the oceans from the way we eat. There's a pattern here. Forget nuclear holocaust  it's the fork that we have to worry about. We have ravaged our Earth and then used the food that we've sourced to handicap ourselves in more ways than one. So I think we have this whole eating thing wrong. And so I think it's time we change what we expect from our food. Sustainability is complicated but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand. So let's start there. There's been a lot of movement recently in greening our food systems. Dan Barber and Alice Waters are leading passionately the green food Delicious Revolution. But green foods often represent a way for us to disregard the responsibility as eaters. Just because it comes from a green source doesn't mean we can treat it with disregard on the plate. We have eco friendly shrimp. We can make them  we have that technology. But we can never have any eco friendly all you can eat shrimp buffet. It doesn't work. Heart healthy dinner is a very important part of restorative seafood. While we try to manage declining marine populations  the media's recommending increased consumption of seafood. Studies say that tens of thousands of American grandmothers  grandfathers  mothers and fathers might be around for another birthday if we included more seafood. That's a reward I am not willing to pass up. But it's not all about the seafood. It's about the way that we look at our plates. As a chef  I realize the easiest thing for me to do is reduce the portion sizes on my plate. A couple things happened. I made more money. People started buying appetizers and salads  because they knew they weren't going to fill up on the entrees alone. People spent more time engaging in their meals  engaging with each other over their meals. People got  in short  more of what they came there for even though they got less protein. They got more calories over the course of a diversified meal. They got healthier. I made more money. This is great. Environmental consideration was served with every plate  but it was served with a heaping mound of consideration for human interests at the same time. One of the other things we did was begin to diversify the species that we served    small silverfish  anchovies  mackerel  sardines were uncommon. Shellfish  mussels  oysters  clams  tilapia  char    these were the common species. We were directing tastes towards more resilience  more restorative options. This is what we need to favor. This is what the green list says. But this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment. But what of those big predators  those fashionable species  that green list tuna that I was talking about earlier  Well  if you must  I have a recipe for you. It pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean  so here we go. Start with a    ounce portion of big fish. Get a knife. Cut it into four portions. Put it on four plates. Mound up those four plates with vegetables and then open up the very best bottle of Burgundy you have  light the candles and celebrate it. Celebrate the opportunity you have to eat this. Invite your friends and neighbors over and repeat once a year  maybe. I expect a lot from food. I expect health and joy and family and community. I expect that producing ingredients  preparing dishes and eating meals is all part of the communion of human interests. I was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook. And he taught me very early on about the privilege that eating represents. I remember well the meals of my childhood. They were reasonable portions of protein served with copious quantities of vegetables and small amounts of starch  usually rice. This is still how I largely eat today. I get sick when I go to steakhouses. I get the meat sweats. It's like a hangover from protein. It's disgusting. But of all the dire news that you'll hear and that you have heard about the state of our oceans  I have the unfortunate burden of delivering to you possibly the very worst of it and that is this whole time your mother was right. Eat your vegetables. It's pretty straightforward. So what are we looking for in a meal  Well for health  I'm looking for wholesome ingredients that are good for my body. For joy  I'm looking for butter and salt and sexy things that make things taste less like penance. For family  I'm looking for recipes that genuflect to my own personal histories. For community though  we start at the very beginning. There's no escaping the fact that everything we eat has a global impact. So try and learn as best you can what that impact is and then take the first step to minimize it. We've seen an image of our blue planet  our world bank. But it is more than just a repository of our resources  it's also the global geography of the communion we call dinner. So if we all take only what we need  then we can begin to share the rest  we can begin to celebrate  we can begin to restore. We need to savor vegetables. We need to savor smaller portions of seafood. And we need to save dinner. Thank you. I'm a bug lover  myself    not from childhood  by the way  but rather late. When I bachelored  majoring in zoology in Tel Aviv University  I kind of fell in love with bugs. And then  within zoology  I took the course or the discipline of entomology  the science of insects. And then I thought  myself  how can I be practical or help in the science of entomology  And then I moved to the world of plant protection    plant protection from insects  from bad bugs. And then within plant protection  I came into the discipline of biological pest control which we actually define as the use of living organisms to reduce populations of noxious plant pests. So it's a whole discipline in plant protection that's aiming at the reduction of chemicals. And biological pest control  by the way  or these good bugs that we are talking about  they've existed in the world for thousands and thousands of years  for a long  long time. But only in the last     years people started  or people knew more and more how to exploit  or how to use  this biological control phenomenon  or in fact  natural control phenomenon  to their own needs. Because biological control phenomenon  you can see it in your backyard. Just take a magnifying glass. You see what I have here  That's a magnifier times   . Yeah  times   . Just open it. You just twist leaves  and you see a whole new world of minute insects  or little spiders of one millimeter  one and a half  two millimeters long  and you can distinguish between the good ones and the bad ones. So this phenomenon of natural control exists literally everywhere. Here  in front of this building  I'm sure. Just have a look at the plants. So it's everywhere  and we need to know how to exploit it. Well let us go hand by hand and browse through just a few examples. What is a pest  What damage  does  it actually inflict on the plant  And what is the natural enemy  the biologically controlled agent  or the good bug  that we are talking about  In general  I'm going to talk about insects and spiders  or mites  let us call them. Insects  those six legged organisms and spiders or mites  the eight legged organisms. Let's have a look at that. Here is a pest  devastating pest  a spider mite  because it does a lot of webbing like a spider. You see the mother in between and two daughters  probably on the left and right  and a single egg on the right hand side. And then you see what kind of damage it can inflict. On your right hand side you can see a cucumber leaf  and on the middle  cotton leaf  and on the left a tomato leaf with these little stipplings. They can literally turn from green to white because of the sucking  piercing mouthparts of those spiders. But here comes nature that provides us with a good spider. This is a predatory mite    just as small as a spider mite  by the way  one millimeter  two millimeters long  not more than that  running quickly  hunting  chasing the spider mites. And here you can see this lady in action on your left hand side    just pierces  sucks the body fluids on the left hand side of the pest mite. And after five minutes  this is what you see  just a typical dead corpse  shriveled  sucked out  dead corpse of the spider mite  and next to it  two satiated individuals of predatory mites  a mother on the left hand side  a young nymph on the right hand side. By the way  a meal for them for    hours is about five individuals of the spider mites  of the bad mites  or    to    eggs of the pest mites. By the way  they are hungry always. And there is another example  aphids. By the way  it's springtime now in Israel. When temperature rises sharply  you can see those bad ones  those aphids  all over the plants  in your hibiscus  in your lantana  in the young  fresh foliage of the spring flush  so called. By the way  with aphids you have only females  like Amazons. Females giving rise to females giving rise to other females. No males at all. Parthenogenesis   as it  was so called. And they are very happy with that  apparently. Here we can see the damage. Those aphids secrete some sticky  sugary liquid called honeydew  and this just globs the upper parts of the plant. Here you see a typical cucumber leaf that turned actually from green to black because of a black fungus  sooty mold  which is covering it. And here comes the salvation through this parasitic wasp. Here we are not talking about a predator. Here we are talking a parasite    not a two legged parasite  but an eight legged parasite  of course. This is a parasitic wasp  again  two millimeters long  slender  a very quick and sharp flier. And here you can see this parasite in action  like in an acrobatic maneuver. She stands vis a vis in front of the victim at the right hand side  bending its abdomen and inserting a single egg  a single egg into the body fluids of the aphid. By the way  the aphid tries to escape. She kicks and bites and secretes different liquids  but nothing will happen  in fact. Only the egg of the parasite will be inserted into the body fluids of the aphid. And after a few days  depending upon temperature  the egg will hatch and the larva of this parasite will eat the aphid from the inside. This is all natural. This is all natural. This is not fiction  nothing at all. Again  in your backyard  in your backyard. But this is the end result. This is the end result  Mummies    M U M M Y. This is the visual result of a dead aphid encompassing inside  in fact  a developing parasitoid that after a few minutes you see halfway out. The birth is almost complete. You can see  by the way  in different movies  etc.  it takes just a few minutes. And if this is a female  she'll immediately mate with a male and off she goes because time is very short. This female can live only three to four days  and she needs to give rise to around     eggs. That means she has     bad aphids to put her eggs into their body fluids. And this is of course not the end of it. There is a whole wealth of other natural enemies and this is just the last example. Again  we'll start first with the pest  the thrips. By the way  all these weird names    I didn't bother you with the Latin names of these creatures  okay  just the popular names. But this is a nice  slender  very bad pest. If you can see this  sweet peppers. This is not just an exotic  ornamental sweet pepper. This is a sweet pepper which is not consumable because it is suffering from a viral disease transmitted by those thrip adults. And here comes the natural enemy  minute pirate bug   minute  because it is rather small. Here you can see the adult  black  and two young ones. And again  in action. This adult pierces the thrips  sucking it within just several minutes  just going to the other prey  continuing all over the place. And if we spread those minute pirate bugs  the good ones  for example  in a sweet pepper plot  they go to the flowers. And look  this flower is flooded with predatory bugs  with the good ones after wiping out the bad ones  the thrips. So this is a very positive situation  by the way. No harm to the developing fruit. No harm to the fruit set. Everything is just fine under these circumstances. But again  the question is  here you saw them on a one to one basis    the pest  the natural enemy. What we do is actually this. In Northeast Israel  in Kibbutz Sde Eliyahu  there is a facility that mass produces those natural enemies. In other words  what we do there  we amplify  we amplify the natural control  or the biological control phenomenon. And in        square meters of state of the art greenhouses  there  we are mass producing those predatory mites  those minute pirate bugs  those parasitic wasps  etc.  etc. Many different parts. By the way  they have a very nice landscape    you see the Jordanian Mountains on the one hand and the Jordan Valley on the other hand  and a good  mild winter and a nice  hot summer  which is an excellent condition to mass produce those creatures. And by the way  mass production    it is not genetic manipulation. There are no GMOs    Genetically Modified Organisms    whatsoever. We take them from nature  and the only thing that we do  we give them the optimal conditions  under the greenhouses or in the climate rooms  in order to proliferate  multiply and reproduce. And that's what we get  in fact. You see under a microscope. You see in the upper left corner  you see a single predatory mite. And this is the whole bunch of predatory mites. You see this ampoule. You see this one. I have one gram of those predatory mites. One gram's        individuals         individuals are good enough to control one acre        square meters  of a strawberry plot against spider mites for the whole season of almost one year. And we can produce from this  believe you me  several dozens of kilograms on an annual basis. So this is what I call amplification of the phenomenon. And no  we do not disrupt the balance. On the contrary  because we bring it to every cultural plot where the balance was already disrupted by the chemicals. Here we come with those natural enemies in order to reverse a little bit of the wheel and to bring more natural balance to the agricultural plot by reducing those chemicals. That's the whole idea. And what is the impact  In this table  you can actually see what is an impact of a successful biological control by good bugs. For example  in Israel  where we employ more than       hectares           dunams in Israeli terms    of biological pest controlling sweet pepper under protection     percent of the pesticides were actually reduced. And Israeli strawberries  even more       percent of the pesticides  especially those aimed against pest mites in strawberries. So the impact is very strong. And there goes the question  especially if you ask growers  agriculturists  Why biological control  Why good bugs  By the way  the number of answers you get equals the number of people you ask. But if we go  for example  to this place  Southeast Israel  the Arava area above the Great Rift Valley  where the really top notch    the pearl of the Israeli agriculture is located  especially under greenhouse conditions  or under screenhouse conditions    if you drive all the way to Eilat  you see this just in the middle of the desert. And if you zoom in  you can definitely watch this  grandparents with their grandchildren  distributing the natural enemies  the good bugs  instead of wearing special clothes and gas masks and applying chemicals. So safety  with respect to the application  this is the number one answer that we get from growers  why biological control. Number two  many growers are in fact petrified from the idea of resistance  that the pests will become resistant to the chemicals  just in our case that bacteria becomes resistant to antibiotics. It's the same  and it can happen very quickly. Fortunately  in either biological control or even natural control  resistance is extremely rare. It hardly happens. Because this is evolution  this is the natural ratio  unlike resistance  which happens in the case of chemicals. And thirdly  public demand. Public demand    the more the public demands the reduction of chemicals  the more growers become aware of the fact they should  wherever they can and wherever possible  replace the chemical control with biological control. Even here  there is another grower  you see  very interested in the bugs  the bad ones and the good ones  wearing this magnifier already on her head  just walking safely in her crop. Finally  I want to get actually to my vision  or in fact  to my dream. Because  you see  this is the reality. Have a look at the gap. If we take the overall turnover of the biocontrol industry worldwide  it's     million dollars. And look at the overall pesticide industry in all the crops throughout the world. I think it's times     or something like that. Twenty five billion. So there is a huge gap to bridge. So actually  how can we do it  How can we bridge  or let's say  narrow  this gap in the course of the years  First of all  we need to find more robust  good and reliable biological solutions  more good bugs that we can either mass produce or actually conserve in the field. Secondly  to create even more intensive and strict public demand to reduction of chemicals in the agricultural fresh produce. And thirdly  also to increase awareness by the growers to the potential of this industry. And this gap really narrows. Step by step  it does narrow. So I think my last slide is  All we are saying  we can actually sing it  Give nature a chance. So I'm saying it on behalf of all the biocontrol petitioners and implementers  in Israel and abroad  really give nature a chance. Thank you. I love video games. I'm also slightly in awe of them. I'm in awe of their power in terms of imagination  in terms of technology  in terms of concept. But I think  above all  I'm in awe at their power to motivate  to compel us  to transfix us  like really nothing else we've ever invented has quite done before. And I think that we can learn some pretty amazing things by looking at how we do this. And in particular  I think we can learn things about learning. Now the video games industry is far and away the fastest growing of all modern media. From about    billion in       it's worth    billion dollars globally today  and it shows no sign of slowing down. In four years' time  it's estimated it'll be worth over    billion dollars. That's about three times the recorded music industry. This is pretty stunning  but I don't think it's the most telling statistic of all. The thing that really amazes me is that  today  people spend about eight billion real dollars a year buying virtual items that only exist inside video games. This is a screenshot from the virtual game world  Entropia Universe. Earlier this year  a virtual asteroid in it sold for         real dollars. And this is a Titan class ship in the space game  EVE Online. And this virtual object takes     real people about    days of real time to build  plus countless thousands of hours of effort before that. And yet  many of these get built. At the other end of the scale  the game Farmville that you may well have heard of  has    million players around the world and most of these players are playing it almost every day. This may all sound really quite alarming to some people  an index of something worrying or wrong in society. But we're here for the good news  and the good news is that I think we can explore why this very real human effort  this very intense generation of value  is occurring. And by answering that question  I think we can take something extremely powerful away. And I think the most interesting way to think about how all this is going on is in terms of rewards. And specifically  it's in terms of the very intense emotional rewards that playing games offers to people both individually and collectively. Now if we look at what's going on in someone's head when they are being engaged  two quite different processes are occurring. On the one hand  there's the wanting processes. This is a bit like ambition and drive    I'm going to do that. I'm going to work hard. On the other hand  there's the liking processes  fun and affection and delight and an enormous flying beast with an orc on the back. It's a really great image. It's pretty cool. It's from the game World of Warcraft with more than    million players globally  one of whom is me  another of whom is my wife. And this kind of a world  this vast flying beast you can ride around  shows why games are so very good at doing both the wanting and the liking. Because it's very powerful. It's pretty awesome. It gives you great powers. Your ambition is satisfied  but it's very beautiful. It's a very great pleasure to fly around. And so these combine to form a very intense emotional engagement. But this isn't the really interesting stuff. The really interesting stuff about virtuality is what you can measure with it. Because what you can measure in virtuality is everything. Every single thing that every single person who's ever played in a game has ever done can be measured. The biggest games in the world today are measuring more than one billion points of data about their players  about what everybody does    far more detail than you'd ever get from any website. And this allows something very special to happen in games. It's something called the reward schedule. And by this  I mean looking at what millions upon millions of people have done and carefully calibrating the rate  the nature  the type  the intensity of rewards in games to keep them engaged over staggering amounts of time and effort. Now  to try and explain this in sort of real terms  I want to talk about a kind of task that might fall to you in so many games. Go and get a certain amount of a certain little game y item. Let's say  for the sake of argument  my mission is to get    pies and I can get    pies by killing these cute  little monsters. Simple game quest. Now you can think about this  if you like  as a problem about boxes. I've got to keep opening boxes. I don't know what's inside them until I open them. And I go around opening box after box until I've got    pies. Now  if you take a game like Warcraft  you can think about it  if you like  as a great box opening effort. The game's just trying to get people to open about a million boxes  getting better and better stuff in them. This sounds immensely boring but games are able to make this process incredibly compelling. And the way they do this is through a combination of probability and data. Let's think about probability. If we want to engage someone in the process of opening boxes to try and find pies  we want to make sure it's neither too easy  nor too difficult  to find a pie. So what do you do  Well  you look at a million people    no      million people      million box openers    and you work out  if you make the pie rate about    percent    that's neither too frustrating  nor too easy. It keeps people engaged. But of course  that's not all you do    there's    pies. Now  I could make a game called Piecraft  where all you had to do was get a million pies or a thousand pies. That would be very boring. Fifteen is a pretty optimal number. You find that    you know  between five and    is about the right number for keeping people going. But we don't just have pies in the boxes. There's     percent up here. And what we do is make sure that every time a box is opened  there's something in it  some little reward that keeps people progressing and engaged. In most adventure games  it's a little bit in game currency  a little bit experience. But we don't just do that either. We also say there's going to be loads of other items of varying qualities and levels of excitement. There's going to be a    percent chance you get a pretty good item. There's going to be a  .  percent chance you get an absolutely awesome item. And each of these rewards is carefully calibrated to the item. And also  we say   Well  how many monsters  Should I have the entire world full of a billion monsters   No  we want one or two monsters on the screen at any one time. So I'm drawn on. It's not too easy  not too difficult. So all this is very powerful. But we're in virtuality. These aren't real boxes. So we can do some rather amazing things. We notice  looking at all these people opening boxes  that when people get to about    out of    pies  their perception shifts  they start to get a bit bored  a bit testy. They're not rational about probability. They think this game is unfair. It's not giving me my last two pies. I'm going to give up. If they're real boxes  there's not much we can do  but in a game we can just say   Right  well. When you get to    pies  you've got    percent chance of getting a pie now.  Keep you engaged. Look at what people do    adjust the world to match their expectation. Our games don't always do this. And one thing they certainly do at the moment is if you got a  .  percent awesome item  they make very sure another one doesn't appear for a certain length of time to keep the value  to keep it special. And the point is really that we evolved to be satisfied by the world in particular ways. Over tens and hundreds of thousands of years  we evolved to find certain things stimulating  and as very intelligent  civilized beings  we're enormously stimulated by problem solving and learning. But now  we can reverse engineer that and build worlds that expressly tick our evolutionary boxes. So what does all this mean in practice  Well  I've come up with seven things that  I think  show how you can take these lessons from games and use them outside of games. The first one is very simple  experience bars measuring progress    something that's been talked about brilliantly by people like Jesse Schell earlier this year. It's already been done at the University of Indiana in the States  among other places. It's the simple idea that instead of grading people incrementally in little bits and pieces  you give them one profile character avatar which is constantly progressing in tiny  tiny  tiny little increments which they feel are their own. And everything comes towards that  and they watch it creeping up  and they own that as it goes along. Second  multiple long and short term aims          pies  boring     pies  interesting. So  you give people lots and lots of different tasks. You say  it's about doing    of these questions  but another task is turning up to    classes on time  but another task is collaborating with other people  another task is showing you're working five times  another task is hitting this particular target. You break things down into these calibrated slices that people can choose and do in parallel to keep them engaged and that you can use to point them towards individually beneficial activities. Third  you reward effort. It's your     percent factor. Games are brilliant at this. Every time you do something  you get credit  you get a credit for trying. You don't punish failure. You reward every little bit of effort    a little bit of gold  a little bit of credit. You've done    questions    tick. It all feeds in as minute reinforcement. Fourth  feedback. This is absolutely crucial  and virtuality is dazzling at delivering this. If you look at some of the most intractable problems in the world today that we've been hearing amazing things about  it's very  very hard for people to learn if they cannot link consequences to actions. Pollution  global warming  these things    the consequences are distant in time and space. It's very hard to learn  to feel a lesson. But if you can model things for people  if you can give things to people that they can manipulate and play with and where the feedback comes  then they can learn a lesson  they can see  they can move on  they can understand. And fifth  the element of uncertainty. Now this is the neurological goldmine  if you like  because a known reward excites people  but what really gets them going is the uncertain reward  the reward pitched at the right level of uncertainty  that they didn't quite know whether they were going to get it or not. The    percent. This lights the brain up. And if you think about using this in testing  in just introducing control elements of randomness in all forms of testing and training  you can transform the levels of people's engagement by tapping into this very powerful evolutionary mechanism. When we don't quite predict something perfectly  we get really excited about it. We just want to go back and find out more. As you probably know  the neurotransmitter associated with learning is called dopamine. It's associated with reward seeking behavior. And something very exciting is just beginning to happen in places like the University of Bristol in the U.K.  where we are beginning to be able to model mathematically dopamine levels in the brain. And what this means is we can predict learning  we can predict enhanced engagement  these windows  these windows of time  in which the learning is taking place at an enhanced level. And two things really flow from this. The first has to do with memory  that we can find these moments. When someone is more likely to remember  we can give them a nugget in a window. And the second thing is confidence  that we can see how game playing and reward structures make people braver  make them more willing to take risks  more willing to take on difficulty  harder to discourage. This can all seem very sinister. But you know  sort of  our brains have been manipulated  we're all addicts.  The word  addiction  is thrown around. There are real concerns there. But the biggest neurological turn on for people is other people. This is what really excites us. In reward terms  it's not money  it's not being given cash    that's nice    it's doing stuff with our peers  watching us  collaborating with us. And I want to tell you a quick story about         a video game called EverQuest. And in this video game  there were two really big dragons  and you had to team up to kill them       people  up to    to kill these big dragons. That's a problem because they dropped two or three decent items. So players addressed this problem by spontaneously coming up with a system to motivate each other  fairly and transparently. What happened was  they paid each other a virtual currency they called  dragon kill points.  And every time you turned up to go on a mission  you got paid in dragon kill points. They tracked these on a separate website. So they tracked their own private currency  and then players could bid afterwards for cool items they wanted    all organized by the players themselves. Now the staggering system  not just that this worked in EverQuest  but that today  a decade on  every single video game in the world with this kind of task uses a version of this system    tens of millions of people. And the success rate is at close to     percent. This is a player developed  self enforcing  voluntary currency  and it's incredibly sophisticated player behavior. And I just want to end by suggesting a few ways in which these principles could fan out into the world. Let's start with business. I mean  we're beginning to see some of the big problems around something like business are recycling and energy conservation. We're beginning to see the emergence of wonderful technologies like real time energy meters. And I just look at this  and I think  yes  we could take that so much further by allowing people to set targets by setting calibrated targets  by using elements of uncertainty  by using these multiple targets  by using a grand  underlying reward and incentive system  by setting people up to collaborate in terms of groups  in terms of streets to collaborate and compete  to use these very sophisticated group and motivational mechanics we see. In terms of education  perhaps most obviously of all  we can transform how we engage people. We can offer people the grand continuity of experience and personal investment. We can break things down into highly calibrated small tasks. We can use calculated randomness. We can reward effort consistently as everything fields together. And we can use the kind of group behaviors that we see evolving when people are at play together  these really quite unprecedentedly complex cooperative mechanisms. Government  well  one thing that comes to mind is the U.S. government  among others  is literally starting to pay people to lose weight. So we're seeing financial reward being used to tackle the great issue of obesity. But again  those rewards could be calibrated so precisely if we were able to use the vast expertise of gaming systems to just jack up that appeal  to take the data  to take the observations  of millions of human hours and plow that feedback into increasing engagement. And in the end  it's this word   engagement   that I want to leave you with. It's about how individual engagement can be transformed by the psychological and the neurological lessons we can learn from watching people that are playing games. But it's also about collective engagement and about the unprecedented laboratory for observing what makes people tick and work and play and engage on a grand scale in games. And if we can look at these things and learn from them and see how to turn them outwards  then I really think we have something quite revolutionary on our hands. Thank you very much. So there are a few things that bring us humans together in the way that an election does. We stand in elections  we vote in elections  we observe elections. Our democracies rely on elections. We all understand why we have elections  and we all leave the house on the same day to go and vote. We cherish the opportunity to have our say  to help decide the future of the country. The fundamental idea is that politicians are given mandate to speak for us  to make decisions on our behalf that affect us all. Without that mandate  they would be corrupt. Well unfortunately  power corrupts  and so people will do lots of things to get power and to stay in power  including doing bad things to elections. You see  even if the idea of the election is perfect  running a countrywide election is a big project  and big projects are messy. Whenever there is an election  it seems like something always goes wrong  someone tries to cheat  or something goes accidentally awry    a ballot box goes missing here  chads are left hanging over here. To make sure as few things as possible go wrong  we have all these procedures around the election. So for example  you come to the polling station  and a poll station worker asks for your ID before giving you a ballot form and asking you to go into a voting booth to fill out your vote. When you come back out  you get to drop your vote into the ballot box where it mixes with all the other votes  so that no one knows how you voted. Well  what I want us to think about for a moment is what happens after that  after you drop your vote into the ballot box. And most people would go home and feel sure that their vote has been counted  because they trust that the election system works. They trust that election workers and election observers do their jobs and do their jobs correctly. The ballot boxes go to counting places. They're unsealed and the votes are poured out and laboriously counted. Most of us have to trust that that happens correctly for our own vote  and we all have to trust that that happens correctly for all the votes in the election. So we have to trust a lot of people. We have to trust a lot of procedures. And sometimes we even have to trust computers. So imagine hundreds of millions of voters casting hundreds of millions of votes  all to be counted correctly and all the things that can possibly go wrong causing all these bad headlines  and you cannot help but feel exhausted at the idea of trying to make elections better. Well in the face of all these bad headlines  researchers have taken a step back and thought about how we can do elections differently. They've zoomed out and looked at the big picture. And the big picture is this  elections should be verifiable. Voters should be able to check that their votes are counted correctly  without breaking election secrecy  which is so very important. And that's the tough part. How do we make an election system completely verifiable while keeping the votes absolutely secret  Well  the way we've come up with uses computers but doesn't depend on them. And the secret is the ballot form. And if you look closely at these ballot forms  you'll notice that the candidate list is in a different order on each one. And that means  if you mark your choices on one of them and then remove the candidate list  I won't be able to tell from the bit remaining what your vote is for. And on each ballot form there is this encrypted value in the form of this  D barcode on the right. And there's some complicated cryptography going on in there  but what's not complicated is voting with one of these forms. So we can let computers do all the complicated cryptography for us  and then we'll use the paper for verification. So this is how you vote. You get one of these ballot forms at random  and then you go into the voting booth  and you mark your choices  and you tear along a perforation. And you shred the candidate list. And the bit that remains  the one with your marks    this is your encrypted vote. So you let a poll station worker scan your encrypted vote. And because it's encrypted  it can be submitted  stored and counted centrally and displayed on a website for anyone to see  including you. So you take this encrypted vote home as your receipt. And after the close of the election  you can check that your vote was counted by comparing your receipt to the vote on the website. And remember  the vote is encrypted from the moment you leave the voting booth  so if an election official wants to find out how you voted  they will not be able to. If the government wants to find out how you voted  they won't be able to. No hacker can break in and find out how you voted. No hacker can break in and change your vote  because then it won't match your receipt. Votes can't go missing because then you won't find yours when you look for it. But the election magic doesn't stop there. Instead  we want to make the whole process so transparent that news media and international observers and anyone who wants to can download all the election data and do the count themselves. They can check that all the votes were counted correctly. They can check that the announced result of the election is the correct one. And these are elections by the people  for the people. So the next step for our democracies are transparent and verifiable elections. Thank you. I guess the story actually has to start maybe back in the the     s  when I was seven or eight years old  watching Jacques Cousteau documentaries on the living room floor with my mask and flippers on. Then after every episode  I had to go up to the bathtub and swim around the bathtub and look at the drain  because that's all there was to look at. And by the time I turned     I pursued a career in marine science  in exploration and diving  and lived in underwater habitats  like this one off the Florida Keys  for    days total. Brian Skerry took this shot. Thanks  Brian. And I've dived in deep sea submersibles around the world. And this one is the deepest diving submarine in the world  operated by the Japanese government. And Sylvia Earle and I were on an expedition in this submarine    years ago in Japan. And on my dive  I went down        feet  to an area that I thought would be pristine wilderness area on the sea floor. But when I got there  I found lots of plastic garbage and other debris. And it was really a turning point in my life  where I started to realize that I couldn't just go have fun doing science and exploration. I needed to put it into a context. I needed to head towards conservation goals. So I began to work with National Geographic Society and others and led expeditions to Antarctica. I led three diving expeditions to Antarctica. Ten years ago was a seminal trip  where we explored that big iceberg  B     the largest iceberg in history  that broke off the Ross Ice Shelf. And we developed techniques to dive inside and under the iceberg  such as heating pads on our kidneys with a battery that we dragged around  so that  as the blood flowed through our kidneys  it would get a little boost of warmth before going back into our bodies. But after three trips to Antarctica  I decided that it might be nicer to work in warmer water. And that same year     years ago  I headed north to the Phoenix Islands. And I'm going to tell you that story here in a moment. But before I do  I just want you to ponder this graph for a moment. You may have seen this in other forms  but the top line is the amount of protected area on land  globally  and it's about    percent. And you can see that it kind of hockey sticks up around the     s and '  s  and it's on kind of a nice trajectory right now. And that's probably because that's when everybody got aware of the environment and Earth Day and all the stuff that happened in the '  s with the Hippies and everything really did  I think  have an affect on global awareness. But the ocean protected area is basically flat line until right about now    it appears to be ticking up. And I do believe that we are at the hockey stick point of the protected area in the ocean. I think we would have gotten there a lot earlier if we could see what happens in the ocean like we can see what happens on land. But unfortunately  the ocean is opaque  and we can't see what's going on. And therefore we're way behind on protection. But scuba diving  submersibles and all the work that we're setting about to do here will help rectify that. So where are the Phoenix Islands  They were the world's largest marine protected area up until last week when the Chagos Archipelago was declared. It's in the mid Pacific. It's about five days from anywhere. If you want to get to the Phoenix Islands  it's five days from Fiji  it's five days from Hawaii  it's five days from Samoa. It's out in the middle of the Pacific  right around the Equator. I had never heard of the islands    years ago  nor the country  Kiribati  that owns them  till two friends of mine who run a liveaboard dive boat in Fiji said   Greg  would you lead a scientific expedition up to these islands  They've never been dived.  And I said   Yeah. But tell me where they are and the country that owns them.  So that's when I first learned of the Islands and had no idea what I was getting into. But I was in for the adventure. Let me give you a little peek here of the Phoenix Islands protected area. It's a very deep water part of our planet. The average depths are about        ft. There's lots of seamounts in the Phoenix Islands  which are specifically part of the protected area. Seamounts are important for biodiversity. There's actually more mountains in the ocean than there are on land. It's an interesting fact. And the Phoenix Islands is very rich in those seamounts. So it's a deep    think about it in a big three dimensional space  very deep three dimensional space with herds of tuna  whales  all kinds of deep sea marine life like we've seen here before. That's the vessel that we took up there for these studies  early on  and that's what the Islands look like    you can see in the background. They're very low to the water  and they're all uninhabited  except one island has about    caretakers on it. And they've been uninhabited for most of time because even in the ancient days  these islands were too far away from the bright lights of Fiji and Hawaii and Tahiti for those ancient Polynesian mariners that were traversing the Pacific so widely. But we got up there  and I had the unique and wonderful scientific opportunity and personal opportunity to get to a place that had never been dived and just get to an island and go   Okay  where are we going to dive  Let's try there   and then falling into the water. Both my personal and my professional life changed. Suddenly  I saw a world that I had never seen before in the ocean    schools of fish that were so dense they dulled the penetration of sunlight from the surface  coral reefs that were continuous and solid and colorful  large fish everywhere  manta rays. It was an ecosystem. Parrotfish spawning    this is about       longnose parrotfish spawning at the entrance to one of the Phoenix Islands. You can see the fish are balled up and then there's a little cloudy area there where they're exchanging the eggs and sperm for reproduction    events that the ocean is supposed to do  but struggles to do in many places now because of human activity. The Phoenix Islands and all the equatorial parts of our planet are very important for tuna fisheries  especially this yellowfin tuna that you see here. Phoenix Islands is a major tuna location. And sharks    we had sharks on our early dives  up to     sharks at once  which is an indication of a very  very healthy  very strong  system. So I thought the scenes of never ending wilderness would go on forever  but they did finally come to an end. And we explored the surface of the Islands as well    very important bird nesting site  some of the most important bird nesting sites in the Pacific  in the world. And we finished our trip. And that's the area again. You can see the Islands    there are eight islands    that pop out of the water. The peaks that don't come out of the water are the seamounts. Remember  a seamount turns into an island when it hits the surface. And what's the context of the Phoenix Islands  Where do these exist  Well they exist in the Republic of Kiribati  and Kiribati is located in the Central Pacific in three island groups. In the west we have the Gilbert Islands. In the center we have the Phoenix Islands  which is the subject that I'm talking about. And then over to the east we have the Line Islands. It's the largest atoll nation in the world. And they have about         people spread out over    islands. They control  .  million cubic miles of ocean  and that's between one and two percent of all the ocean water on the planet. And when I was first going up there  I barely knew the name of this country    years ago  and people would ask me   Why are you going to this place called Kiribati   And it reminded me of that old joke where the bank robber comes out of the courthouse handcuffed  and the reporter yells   Hey  Willy. Why do you rob banks   And he says   cause that's where all the money is.  And I would tell people   Why do I go to Kiribati  Because that's where all the ocean is.  They basically are one nation that controls most of the equatorial waters of the Central Pacific Ocean. They're also a country that is in dire danger. Sea levels are rising  and Kiribati  along with    other nations in the world  will be under water within    to     years due to climate change and the associated sea level rise from thermal expansion and the melting of freshwater into the ocean. The Islands rise only one to two meters above the surface. Some of the islands have already gone under water. And these nations are faced with a real problem. We as a world are faced with a problem. What do we do with displaced fellow Earthlings who no longer have a home on the planet  The president of the Maldives conducted a mock cabinet meeting underwater recently to highlight the dire straits of these countries. So it's something we need to focus on. But back to the Phoenix Islands  which is the subject of this Talk. After I got back  I said  okay  this is amazing  what we found. I'd like to go back and share it with the government of Kiribati  who are over in Tarawa  the westernmost group. So I started contacting them    because they had actually given me a permit to do this    and I said   I want to come up and tell you what we found.  And for some reason they didn't want me to come  or it was hard to find a time and a place  and it took a while  but finally they said   Okay  you can come. But if you come  you have to buy lunch for everybody who comes to the seminar.  So I said   Okay  I'm happy to buy lunch. Just get whatever anybody wants.  So David Obura  a coral reef biologist  and I went to Tarawa  and we presented for two hours on the amazing findings of the Phoenix Islands. And the country never knew this. They never had any data from this area. They'd never had any information from the Phoenix Islands. After the talk  the Minister of Fisheries walked up to me and he said   Greg  do you realize that you are the first scientist who has ever come back and told us what they did   He said   We often issue these permits to do research in our waters  but usually we get a note two or three years later  or a reprint. But you're the first one who's ever come back and told us what you did. And we really appreciate that. And we're buying you lunch today. And are you free for dinner   And I was free for dinner  and I went out to dinner with the Minister of Fisheries in Kiribati. And over the course of dinner  I learned that Kiribati gains most of its revenue    it's a very poor country    but it gains what revenue is has by selling access to foreign nations to take fish out of its waters  because Kiribati does not have the capacity to take the fish itself. And the deal that they strike is the extracting country gives Kiribati five percent of the landed value. So if the United States removes a million dollars' worth of lobsters from a reef  Kiribati gets        dollars. And  you know  it didn't seem like a very good deal to me. So I asked the Minister over dinner  I said   Would you consider a situation where you would still get paid    we do the math and figure out what the value of the resource is    but you leave fish and the sharks and the shrimp in the water   He stopped  and he said   Yes  we would like to do that to deal with our overfishing problem  and I think we would call it a reverse fishing license.  He coined the term  reverse fishing license.  So I said   Yes  a 'reverse fishing license.'  So we walked away from this dinner really not knowing where to go at that point. I went back to the States and started looking around to see if I could find examples where reverse fishing licenses had been issued  and it turned out there were none. There were no oceanic deals where countries were compensated for not fishing. It had occurred on land  in rainforests of South America and Africa  where landowners had been paid not to cut the trees down. And Conservation International had struck some of those deals. So I went to Conservation International and brought them in as a partner and went through the process of valuing the fishery resource  deciding how much Kiribati should be compensated  what the range of the fishes were  brought in a whole bunch of other partners    the government of Australia  the government of New Zealand  the World Bank. The Oak Foundation and National Geographic have been big funders of this as well. And we basically founded the park on the idea of an endowment that would pay the equivalent lost fishing license fees to this very poor country to keep the area intact. Halfway through this process  I met the president of Kiribati  President Anote Tong. He's a really important leader  a real visionary  forward thinking man  and he told me two things when I approached him. He said   Greg  there's two things I'd like you to do. One is  remember I'm a politician  so you've got to go out and work with my ministers and convince the people of Kiribati that this is a good idea. Secondly  I'd like you to create principles that will transcend my own presidency. I don't want to do something like this if it's going to go away after I'm voted out of office.  So we had very strong leadership  very good vision and a lot of science  a lot of lawyers involved. Many  many steps were taken to pull this off. And it was primarily because Kiribati realized that this was in their own self interest to do this. They realized that this was a common cause that they had found with the conservation community. Then in       when this was all going full swing  a coral bleaching event happened in the Phoenix Islands. Here's this resource that we're looking to save  and it turns out it's the hottest heating event that we can find on record. The ocean heated up as it does sometimes  and the hot spot formed and stalled right over the Phoenix Islands for six months. It was over    degrees Celsius for six months and it basically killed    percent of the coral. So suddenly we had this area that we were protecting  but now it appeared to be dead  at least in the coral areas. Of course the deep sea areas and the open ocean areas were fine  but the coral  which everybody likes to look at  was in trouble. Well  the good news is it's recovered and recovering fast  faster than any reef we've seen. This picture was just taken by Brian Skerry a few months ago when we returned to the Phoenix Islands and discovered that  because it is a protected area and has healthy fish populations that keep the algae grazed down and keep the rest of the reef healthy  the coral is booming  is just booming back. It's almost like if a person has multiple diseases  it's hard to get well  you might die  but if you only have one disease to deal with  you can get better. And that's the story with climate change heating. It's the only threat  the only influence that the reef had to deal with. There was no fishing  there was no pollution  there was no coastal development  and the reef is on a full bore recovery. Now I remember that dinner I had with the Minister of Fisheries    years ago when we first brought this up and I got quite animated during the dinner and said   Well  I think that the conservation community might embrace this idea  Minister.  He paused and put his hands together and said   Yes  Greg  but the devil will be in the details   he said. And it certainly was. The last    years have been detail after detail ranging from creating legislation to multiple research expeditions to communication plans  as I said  teams of lawyers  MOUs  creating the Phoenix Islands Trust Board. And we are now in the process of raising the full endowment. Kiribati has frozen extracting activities at its current state while we raise the endowment. We just had our first PIPA Trust Board meeting three weeks ago. So it's a fully functional up and running entity that negotiates the reverse fishing license with the country. And the PIPA Trust Board holds that license and pays the country for this. So it's a very solid  very well thought out  very well grounded system  and it was a bottom up system  and that was very important with this work  from the bottom up to secure this. So the conditions for success here are listed. You can read them yourselves. But I would say the most important one in my mind was working within the market forces of the situation. And that insured that we could move this forward and it would have both the self interest of Kiribati as well as the self interest of the world. And I'll leave you with one final slide  that is  how do we scale this up  How do we realize Sylvia's dream  Where eventually do we take this  Here's the Pacific with large MPAs and large conservation zones on it. And as you can see  we have a patchwork across this ocean. I've just described to you the one story behind that rectangular area in the middle  the Phoenix Islands  but every other green patch on that has its own story. And what we need to do now is look at the whole Pacific Ocean in its entirety and make a network of MPAs across the Pacific so that we have our world's largest ocean protected and self sustaining over time. Thank you very much.  Applause  I have a doppelganger. Dr. Gero is a brilliant but slightly mad scientist in the  Dragonball Z  Android Saga.  If you look very carefully  you see that his skull has been replaced with a transparent Plexiglas dome so that the workings of his brain can be observed and also controlled with light. That's exactly what I do    optical mind control. But in contrast to my evil twin who lusts after world domination  my motives are not sinister. I control the brain in order to understand how it works. Now wait a minute  you may say  how can you go straight to controlling the brain without understanding it first  Isn't that putting the cart before the horse  Many neuroscientists agree with this view and think that understanding will come from more detailed observation and analysis. They say   If we could record the activity of our neurons  we would understand the brain.  But think for a moment what that means. Even if we could measure what every cell is doing at all times  we would still have to make sense of the recorded activity patterns  and that's so difficult  chances are we'll understand these patterns just as little as the brains that produce them. Take a look at what brain activity might look like. In this simulation  each black dot is one nerve cell. The dot is visible whenever a cell fires an electrical impulse. There's        neurons here. So you're looking at roughly one percent of the brain of a cockroach. Your brains are about     million times more complicated. Somewhere  in a pattern like this  is you  your perceptions  your emotions  your memories  your plans for the future. But we don't know where  since we don't know how to read the pattern. We don't understand the code used by the brain. To make progress  we need to break the code. But how  An experienced code breaker will tell you that in order to figure out what the symbols in a code mean  it's essential to be able to play with them  to rearrange them at will. So in this situation too  to decode the information contained in patterns like this  watching alone won't do. We need to rearrange the pattern. In other words  instead of recording the activity of neurons  we need to control it. It's not essential that we can control the activity of all neurons in the brain  just some. The more targeted our interventions  the better. And I'll show you in a moment how we can achieve the necessary precision. And since I'm realistic  rather than grandiose  I don't claim that the ability to control the function of the nervous system will at once unravel all its mysteries. But we'll certainly learn a lot. Now  I'm by no means the first person to realize how powerful a tool intervention is. The history of attempts to tinker with the function of the nervous system is long and illustrious. It dates back at least     years  to Galvani's famous experiments in the late   th century and beyond. Galvani showed that a frog's legs twitched when he connected the lumbar nerve to a source of electrical current. This experiment revealed the first  and perhaps most fundamental  nugget of the neural code  that information is written in the form of electrical impulses. Galvani's approach of probing the nervous system with electrodes has remained state of the art until today  despite a number of drawbacks. Sticking wires into the brain is obviously rather crude. It's hard to do in animals that run around  and there is a physical limit to the number of wires that can be inserted simultaneously. So around the turn of the last century  I started to think   Wouldn't it be wonderful if one could take this logic and turn it upside down   So instead of inserting a wire into one spot of the brain  re engineer the brain itself so that some of its neural elements become responsive to diffusely broadcast signals such as a flash of light. Such an approach would literally  in a flash of light  overcome many of the obstacles to discovery. First  it's clearly a non invasive  wireless form of communication. And second  just as in a radio broadcast  you can communicate with many receivers at once. You don't need to know where these receivers are  and it doesn't matter if these receivers move    just think of the stereo in your car. It gets even better  for it turns out that we can fabricate the receivers out of materials that are encoded in DNA. So each nerve cell with the right genetic makeup will spontaneously produce a receiver that allows us to control its function. I hope you'll appreciate the beautiful simplicity of this concept. There's no high tech gizmos here  just biology revealed through biology. Now let's take a look at these miraculous receivers up close. As we zoom in on one of these purple neurons  we see that its outer membrane is studded with microscopic pores. Pores like these conduct electrical current and are responsible for all the communication in the nervous system. But these pores here are special. They are coupled to light receptors similar to the ones in your eyes. Whenever a flash of light hits the receptor  the pore opens  an electrical current is switched on  and the neuron fires electrical impulses. Because the light activated pore is encoded in DNA  we can achieve incredible precision. This is because  although each cell in our bodies contains the same set of genes  different mixes of genes get turned on and off in different cells. You can exploit this to make sure that only some neurons contain our light activated pore and others don't. So in this cartoon  the bluish white cell in the upper left corner does not respond to light because it lacks the light activated pore. The approach works so well that we can write purely artificial messages directly to the brain. In this example  each electrical impulse  each deflection on the trace  is caused by a brief pulse of light. And the approach  of course  also works in moving  behaving animals. This is the first ever such experiment  sort of the optical equivalent of Galvani's. It was done six or seven years ago by my then graduate student  Susana Lima. Susana had engineered the fruit fly on the left so that just two out of the         cells in its brain expressed the light activated pore. You're familiar with these cells because they are the ones that frustrate you when you try to swat the fly. They trained the escape reflex that makes the fly jump into the air and fly away whenever you move your hand in position. And you can see here that the flash of light has exactly the same effect. The animal jumps  it spreads its wings  it vibrates them  but it can't actually take off because the fly is sandwiched between two glass plates. Now to make sure that this was no reaction of the fly to a flash it could see  Susana did a simple but brutally effective experiment. She cut the heads off of her flies. These headless bodies can live for about a day  but they don't do much. They just stand around and groom excessively. So it seems that the only trait that survives decapitation is vanity. Anyway  as you'll see in a moment  Susana was able to turn on the flight motor of what's the equivalent of the spinal cord of these flies and get some of the headless bodies to actually take off and fly away. They didn't get very far  obviously. Since we took these first steps  the field of optogenetics has exploded. And there are now hundreds of labs using these approaches. And we've come a long way since Galvani's and Susana's first successes in making animals twitch or jump. We can now actually interfere with their psychology in rather profound ways  as I'll show you in my last example  which is directed at a familiar question. Life is a string of choices creating a constant pressure to decide what to do next. We cope with this pressure by having brains  and within our brains  decision making centers that I've called here the  Actor.  The Actor implements a policy that takes into account the state of the environment and the context in which we operate. Our actions change the environment  or context  and these changes are then fed back into the decision loop. Now to put some neurobiological meat on this abstract model  we constructed a simple one dimensional world for our favorite subject  fruit flies. Each chamber in these two vertical stacks contains one fly. The left and the right halves of the chamber are filled with two different odors  and a security camera watches as the flies pace up and down between them. Here's some such CCTV footage. Whenever a fly reaches the midpoint of the chamber where the two odor streams meet  it has to make a decision. It has to decide whether to turn around and stay in the same odor  or whether to cross the midline and try something new. These decisions are clearly a reflection of the Actor's policy. Now for an intelligent being like our fly  this policy is not written in stone but rather changes as the animal learns from experience. We can incorporate such an element of adaptive intelligence into our model by assuming that the fly's brain contains not only an Actor  but a different group of cells  a  Critic   that provides a running commentary on the Actor's choices. You can think of this nagging inner voice as sort of the brain's equivalent of the Catholic Church  if you're an Austrian like me  or the super ego  if you're Freudian  or your mother  if you're Jewish. Now obviously  the Critic is a key ingredient in what makes us intelligent. So we set out to identify the cells in the fly's brain that played the role of the Critic. And the logic of our experiment was simple. We thought if we could use our optical remote control to activate the cells of the Critic  we should be able  artificially  to nag the Actor into changing its policy. In other words  the fly should learn from mistakes that it thought it had made but  in reality  it had not made. So we bred flies whose brains were more or less randomly peppered with cells that were light addressable. And then we took these flies and allowed them to make choices. And whenever they made one of the two choices  chose one odor  in this case the blue one over the orange one  we switched on the lights. If the Critic was among the optically activated cells  the result of this intervention should be a change in policy. The fly should learn to avoid the optically reinforced odor. Here's what happened in two instances  We're comparing two strains of flies  each of them having about     light addressable cells in their brains  shown here in green on the left and on the right. What's common among these groups of cells is that they all produce the neurotransmitter dopamine. But the identities of the individual dopamine producing neurons are clearly largely different on the left and on the right. Optically activating these hundred or so cells into two strains of flies has dramatically different consequences. If you look first at the behavior of the fly on the right  you can see that whenever it reaches the midpoint of the chamber where the two odors meet  it marches straight through  as it did before. Its behavior is completely unchanged. But the behavior of the fly on the left is very different. Whenever it comes up to the midpoint  it pauses  it carefully scans the odor interface as if it was sniffing out its environment  and then it turns around. This means that the policy that the Actor implements now includes an instruction to avoid the odor that's in the right half of the chamber. This means that the Critic must have spoken in that animal  and that the Critic must be contained among the dopamine producing neurons on the left  but not among the dopamine producing neurons on the right. Through many such experiments  we were able to narrow down the identity of the Critic to just    cells. These    cells  as shown here in green  send the output to a brain structure called the  mushroom body   which is shown here in gray. We know from our formal model that the brain structure at the receiving end of the Critic's commentary is the Actor. So this anatomy suggests that the mushroom bodies have something to do with action choice. Based on everything we know about the mushroom bodies  this makes perfect sense. In fact  it makes so much sense that we can construct an electronic toy circuit that simulates the behavior of the fly. In this electronic toy circuit  the mushroom body neurons are symbolized by the vertical bank of blue LEDs in the center of the board. These LED's are wired to sensors that detect the presence of odorous molecules in the air. Each odor activates a different combination of sensors  which in turn activates a different odor detector in the mushroom body. So the pilot in the cockpit of the fly  the Actor  can tell which odor is present simply by looking at which of the blue LEDs lights up. What the Actor does with this information depends on its policy  which is stored in the strengths of the connection  between the odor detectors and the motors that power the fly's evasive actions. If the connection is weak  the motors will stay off and the fly will continue straight on its course. If the connection is strong  the motors will turn on and the fly will initiate a turn. Now consider a situation in which the motors stay off  the fly continues on its path and it suffers some painful consequence such as getting zapped. In a situation like this  we would expect the Critic to speak up and to tell the Actor to change its policy. We have created such a situation  artificially  by turning on the critic with a flash of light. That caused a strengthening of the connections between the currently active odor detector and the motors. So the next time the fly finds itself facing the same odor again  the connection is strong enough to turn on the motors and to trigger an evasive maneuver. I don't know about you  but I find it exhilarating to see how vague psychological notions evaporate and give rise to a physical  mechanistic understanding of the mind  even if it's the mind of the fly. This is one piece of good news. The other piece of good news  for a scientist at least  is that much remains to be discovered. In the experiments I told you about  we have lifted the identity of the Critic  but we still have no idea how the Critic does its job. Come to think of it  knowing when you're wrong without a teacher  or your mother  telling you  is a very hard problem. There are some ideas in computer science and in artificial intelligence as to how this might be done  but we still haven't solved a single example of how intelligent behavior springs from the physical interactions in living matter. I think we'll get there in the not too distant future. Thank you. Well  there's lots to talk about  but I think I'm just going to play to start off.   When I wake up     in the morning     I pour the coffee     I read the paper     And then I slowly     and so softly     do the dishes     So feed the fishes     You sing me happy birthday     Like it's gonna be     your last day     here on Earth   All right. So  I wanted to do something special today. I want to debut a new song that I've been working on in the last five or six months. And there's few things more thrilling than playing a song for the first time in front of an audience  especially when it's half finished. I'm kind of hoping some conversations here might help me finish it. Because it gets into all sorts of crazy realms. And so this is basically a song about loops  but not the kind of loops that I make up here. They're feedback loops. And in the audio world that's when the microphone gets too close to its sound source  and then it gets in this self destructive loop that creates a very unpleasant sound. And I'm going to demonstrate for you. I'm not going to hurt you. Don't worry.   This is a loop  feedback loop     This is a loop  feedback loop     This is a loop  feedback loop     This is a loop  feedback loop     This is a loop  feedback loop     This is a loop  feedback loop     This is a     Feedback  All right. I don't know if that was necessary to demonstrate       but my point is it's the sound of self destruction. And I've been thinking about how that applies across a whole spectrum of realms  from  say  the ecological  okay. There seems to be a rule in nature that if you get too close to where you came from  it gets ugly. So like  you can't feed cows their own brains or you get mad cow disease  and inbreeding and incest and  let's see  what's the other one  Biological    there's autoimmune diseases  where the body attacks itself a little too overzealously and destroys the host  or the person. And then    okay  this is where we get to the song    kind of bridges the gap to the emotional. Because although I've used scientific terms in songs  it's very difficult sometimes to make them lyrical. And there's some things you just don't need to have in songs. So I'm trying to bridge this gap between this idea and this melody. And so  I don't know if you've ever had this  but when I close my eyes sometimes and try to sleep  I can't stop thinking about my own eyes. And it's like your eyes start straining to see themselves. That's what it feels like to me. It's not pleasant. I'm sorry if I put that idea in your head. It's impossible  of course  for your eyes to see themselves  but they seem to be trying. So that's getting a little more closer to a personal experience. Or ears being able to hear themselves    it's just impossible. That's the thing. So  I've been working on this song that mentions these things and then also imagines a person who's been so successful at defending themselves from heartbreak that they're left to do the deed themselves  if that's possible. And that's what the song is asking. All right. It doesn't have a name yet.   Go ahead and congratulate yourself     Give yourself a hand  the hand is your hand     And the eye that eyes itself is your eye     And the ear that hears itself is near     'Cause it's your ear  oh oh     You've done the impossible now     Took yourself apart     You made yourself invulnerable     No one can break your heart     So you wear it out     And you wring it out     And you wear it out     And you break it yourself     Breaking your own  break it yourself     Breaking your own  break it yourself     Breaking your own   Thanks. All right. It's kind of cool. Songwriters can sort of get away with murder. You can throw out crazy theories and not have to back it up with data or graphs or research. But  you know  I think reckless curiosity would be what the world needs now  just a little bit. I'm going to finish up with a song of mine called  Weather Systems.    Quiet     Quiet down  she said     Speak into the back of his head     On the edge of the bed  I can see your blood flow     I can see your     cells grow     Hold still awhile     Don't spill the wine     I can see it all from here     I can see     oh  I     I can see     weather systems     of the world     Weather systems     of the world     Some things you say     are not for sale     I would hold it where     our free agents of some substance are     scared     Hold still a while     Don't spill the wine     I can see it all from here     I can see     oh  I     I can see     weather systems of the world     Weather systems     of the world   Thanks. So this is a story of a place that I now call home. It's a story of public education and of rural communities and of what design might do to improve both. So this is Bertie County  North Carolina  USA. To give you an idea of the  where   So here's North Carolina  and if we zoom in  Bertie County is in the eastern part of the state. It's about two hours east driving time from Raleigh. And it's very flat. It's very swampy. It's mostly farmland. The entire county is home to just        people  and they're very sparsely distributed. So there's only    people per square mile  which comes down to about    people per square kilometer. Bertie County is kind of a prime example in the demise of rural America. We've seen this story all over the country and even in places beyond the American borders. We know the symptoms. It's the hollowing out of small towns. It's downtowns becoming ghost towns. The brain drain    where all of the most educated and qualified leave and never come back. It's the dependence on farm subsidies and under performing schools and higher poverty rates in rural areas than in urban. And Bertie County is no exception to this. Perhaps the biggest thing it struggles with  like many communities similar to it  is that there's no shared  collective investment in the future of rural communities. Only  .  percent of all our philanthropic giving in the U.S. right now benefits rural communities  and yet    percent of our population lives there. So Bertie County is not only very rural  it's incredibly poor. It is the poorest county in the state. It has one in three of its children living in poverty  and it's what is referred to as a  rural ghetto.  The economy is mostly agricultural. The biggest crops are cotton and tobacco  and we're very proud of our Bertie County peanut. The biggest employer is the Purdue chicken processing plant. The county seat is Windsor. This is like Times Square of Windsor that you're looking at right now. It's home to only       people  and like a lot of other small towns it has been hollowed out over the years. There are more buildings that are empty or in disrepair than occupied and in use. You can count the number of restaurants in the county on one hand    Bunn's Barbecue being my absolute favorite. But in the whole county there is no coffee shop  there's no Internet cafe  there's no movie theater  there's no bookstore. There isn't even a Walmart. Racially  the county is about    percent African American  but what happens in the public schools is most of the privileged white kids go to the private Lawrence Academy. So the public school students are about    percent African American. And this is a spread from the local newspaper of the recent graduating class  and you can see the difference is pretty stark. So to say that the public education system in Bertie County is struggling would be a huge understatement. There's basically no pool of qualified teachers to pull from  and only eight percent of the people in the county have a bachelor's degree or higher. So there isn't a big legacy in the pride of education. In fact  two years ago  only    percent of all the third  through eighth graders were passing the state standard in both English and math. So it sounds like I'm painting a really bleak picture of this place  but I promise there is good news. The biggest asset  in my opinion  one of the biggest assets in Bertie County right now is this man  This is Dr. Chip Zullinger  fondly known as Dr. Z. He was brought in in October      as the new superintendent to basically fix this broken school system. And he previously was a superintendent in Charleston  South Carolina and then in Denver  Colorado. He started some of the country's first charter schools in the late '  s in the U.S. And he is an absolute renegade and a visionary  and he is the reason that I now live and work there. So in February of       Dr. Zullinger invited us  Project H Design    which is a non profit design firm that I founded    to come to Bertie and to partner with him on the repair of this school district and to bring a design perspective to the repair of the school district. And he invited us in particular because we have a very specific type of design process    one that results in appropriate design solutions in places that don't usually have access to design services or creative capital. Specifically  we use these six design directives  probably the most important being number two  we design with  not for    in that  when we're doing humanitarian focused design  it's not about designing for clients anymore. It's about designing with people  and letting appropriate solutions emerge from within. So at the time of being invited down there  we were based in San Francisco  and so we were going back and forth for basically the rest of       spending about half our time in Bertie County. And when I say we  I mean Project H  but more specifically  I mean myself and my partner  Matthew Miller  who's an architect and a sort of MacGyver type builder. So fast forward to today  and we now live there. I have strategically cut Matt's head out of this photo  because he would kill me if he knew I was using it because of the sweatsuits. But this is our front porch. We live there. We now call this place home. Over the course of this year that we spent flying back and forth  we realized we had fallen in love with the place. We had fallen in love with the place and the people and the work that we're able to do in a rural place like Bertie County  that  as designers and builders  you can't do everywhere. There's space to experiment and to weld and to test things. We have an amazing advocate in Dr. Zullinger. There's a nobility of real  hands on  dirt under your fingernails work. But beyond our personal reasons for wanting to be there  there is a huge need. There is a total vacuum of creative capital in Bertie County. There isn't a single licensed architect in the whole county. And so we saw an opportunity to bring design as this untouched tool  something that Bertie County didn't otherwise have  and to be sort of the    to usher that in as a new type of tool in their tool kit. The initial goal became using design within the public education system in partnership with Dr. Zullinger    that was why we were there. But beyond that  we recognized that Bertie County  as a community  was in dire need of a fresh perspective of pride and connectedness and of the creative capital that they were so much lacking. So the goal became  yes  to apply design within education  but then to figure out how to make education a great vehicle for community development. So in order to do this  we've taken three different approaches to the intersection of design and education. And I should say that these are three things that we've done in Bertie County  but I feel pretty confident that they could work in a lot of other rural communities around the U.S. and maybe even beyond. So the first of the three is design for education. This is the most kind of direct  obvious intersection of the two things. It's the physical construction of improved spaces and materials and experiences for teachers and students. This is in response to the awful mobile trailers and the outdated textbooks and the terrible materials that we're building schools out of these days. And so this played out for us in a couple different ways. The first was a series of renovations of computer labs. So traditionally  the computer labs  particularly in an under performing school like Bertie County  where they have to benchmark test every other week  the computer lab is a kill and drill testing facility. You come in  you face the wall  you take your test and you leave. So we wanted to change the way that students approach technology  to create a more convivial and social space that was more engaging  more accessible  and also to increase the ability for teachers to use these spaces for technology based instruction. So this is the lab at the high school  and the principal there is in love with this room. Every time he has visitors  it's the first place that he takes them. And this also meant the co creation with some teachers of this educational playground system called the learning landscape. It allows elementary level students to learn core subjects through game play and activity and running around and screaming and being a kid. So this game that the kids are playing here    in this case they were learning basic multiplication through a game called Match Me. And in Match Me  you take the class  divide it into two teams  one team on each side of the playground  and the teacher will take a piece of chalk and just write a number on each of the tires. And then she'll call out a math problem    so let's say four times four    and then one student from each team has to compete to figure out that four times four is    and find the tire with the    on it and sit on it. So the goal is to have all of your teammates sitting on the tires and then your team wins. And the impact of the learning landscape has been pretty surprising and amazing. Some of the classes and teachers have reported higher test scores  a greater comfort level with the material  especially with the boys  that in going outside and playing  they aren't afraid to take on a double digit multiplication problem    and also that the teachers are able to use these as assessment tools to better gauge how their students are understanding new material. So with design for education  I think the most important thing is to have a shared ownership of the solutions with the teachers  so that they have the incentive and the desire to use them. So this is Mr. Perry. He's the assistant superintendent. He came out for one of our teacher training days and won like five rounds of Match Me in a row and was very proud of himself. So the second approach is redesigning education itself. This is the most complex. It's a systems level look at how education is administered and what is being offered and to whom. So in many cases this is not so much about making change as it is creating the conditions under which change is possible and the incentive to want to make change  which is easier said than done in rural communities and in inside the box education systems in rural communities. So for us  this was a graphic public campaign called Connect Bertie. There are thousands of these blue dots all over the county. And this was for a fund that the school district had to put a desktop computer and a broadband Internet connection in every home with a child in the public school system. Right now I should say  there are only    percent of the houses that actually have an in home Internet connection. And the only places to get WiFi are in the school buildings  or at the Bojangles Fried Chicken joint  which I find myself squatting outside of a lot. Aside from  you know  getting people excited and wondering what the heck these blue dots were all over the place  it asked the school system to envision how it might become a catalyst for a more connected community. It asked them to reach outside of the school walls and to think about how they could play a role in the community's development. So the first batch of computers are being installed later this summer  and we're helping Dr. Zullinger develop some strategies around how we might connect the classroom and the home to extend learning beyond the school day. And then the third approach  which is what I'm most excited about  which is where we are now  is  design as education. So  design as education  means that we could actually teach design within public schools  and not design based learning    not like  let's learn physics by building a rocket   but actually learning design thinking coupled with real construction and fabrication skills put towards a local community purpose. It also means that designers are no longer consultants  but we're teachers  and we are charged with growing creative capital within the next generation. And what design offers as an educational framework is an antidote to all of the boring  rigid  verbal instruction that so many of these school districts are plagued by. It's hands on  it's in your face  it requires an active engagement  and it allows kids to apply all the core subject learning in real ways. So we started thinking about the legacy of shop class and how shop class    wood and metal shop class in particular    historically  has been something intended for kids who aren't going to go to college. It's a vocational training path. It's working class  it's blue collar. The projects are things like  let's make a birdhouse for your mom for Christmas. And in recent decades  a lot of the funding for shop class has gone away entirely. So we thought  what if you could bring back shop class  but this time orient the projects around things that the community needed  and to infuse shop class with a more critical and creative design thinking studio process. So we took this kind of nebulous idea and have worked really closely with Dr. Zullinger for the past year on writing this as a one year curriculum offered at the high school level to the junior class. And so this starts in four weeks  at the end of the summer  and my partner and I  Matthew and I  just went through the arduous and totally convoluted process of getting certified as high school teachers to actually run it. And this is what it looks like. So over the course of two semesters  the Fall and the Spring  the students spend three hours a day every single day in our       square foot studio shop space. And during that time  they're doing everything from going out and doing ethnographic research and doing the need finding  coming back into the studio  doing the brainstorming and design visualization to come up with concepts that might work  and then moving into the shop and actually testing them  building them  prototyping them  figuring out if they are going to work and refining that. And then over the summer  they're offered a summer job. They're paid as employees of Project H to be the construction crew with us to build these projects in the community. So the first project  which will be built next summer  is an open air farmers' market downtown  followed by bus shelters for the school bus system in the second year and home improvements for the elderly in the third year. So these are real visible projects that hopefully the students can point to and say   I built that  and I'm proud of it.  So I want you to meet three of our students. This is Ryan. She is    years old. She loves agriculture and wants to be a high school teacher. She wants to go to college  but she wants to come back to Bertie County  because that's where her family is from  where she calls home  and she feels very strongly about giving back to this place that she's been fairly fortunate in. So what Studio H might offer her is a way to develop skills so that she might give back in the most meaningful way. This is Eric. He plays for the football team. He is really into dirtbike racing  and he wants to be an architect. So for him  Studio H offers him a way to develop the skills he will need as an architect  everything from drafting to wood and metal construction to how to do research for a client. And then this is Anthony. He is    years old  loves hunting and fishing and being outside and doing anything with his hands  and so for him  Studio H means that he can stay interested in his education through that hands on engagement. He's interested in forestry  but he isn't sure  so if he ends up not going to college  he will have developed some industry relevant skills. What design and building really offers to public education is a different kind of classroom. So this building downtown  which may very well become the site of our future farmers' market  is now the classroom. And going out into the community and interviewing your neighbors about what kind of food they buy and from where and why    that's a homework assignment. And the ribbon cutting ceremony at the end of the summer when they have built the farmers' market and it's open to the public    that's the final exam. And for the community  what design and building offers is real  visible  built progress. It's one project per year  and it makes the youth the biggest asset and the biggest untapped resource in imagining a new future. So we recognize that Studio H  especially in its first year  is a small story       students  it's two teachers  it's one project in one place. But we feel like this could work in other places. And I really  strongly believe in the power of the small story  because it is so difficult to do humanitarian work at a global scale. Because  when you zoom out that far  you lose the ability to view people as humans. Ultimately  design itself is a process of constant education for the people that we work with and for and for us as designers. And let's face it  designers  we need to reinvent ourselves. We need to re educate ourselves around the things that matter  we need to work outside of our comfort zones more  and we need to be better citizens in our own backyard. So while this is a very small story  we hope that it represents a step in the right direction for the future of rural communities and for the future of public education and hopefully also for the future of design. Thank you. Today I want to talk to you about ethnic conflict and civil war. These are not normally the most cheerful of topics  nor do they generally generate the kind of good news that this conference is about. Yet  not only is there at least some good news to be told about fewer such conflicts now than two decades ago  but what is perhaps more important is that we also have come to a much better understanding of what can be done to further reduce the number of ethnic conflicts and civil wars and the suffering that they inflict. Three things stand out  leadership  diplomacy and institutional design. What I will focus on in my talk is why they matter  how they matter  and what we can all do to make sure that they continue to matter in the right ways  that is  how all of us can contribute to developing and honing the skills of local and global leaders to make peace and to make it last. But let's start at the beginning. Civil wars have made news headlines for many decades now  and ethnic conflicts in particular have been a near constant presence as a major international security threat. For nearly two decades now  the news has been bad and the images have been haunting. In Georgia  after years of stalemate  we saw a full scale resurgence of violence in August      . This quickly escalated into a five day war between Russia and Georgia  leaving Georgia ever more divided. In Kenya  contested presidential elections in         we just heard about them    quickly led to high levels of inter ethnic violence and the killing and displacement of thousands of people. In Sri Lanka  a decades long civil war between the Tamil minority and the Sinhala majority led to a bloody climax in       after perhaps as many as         people had been killed since     . In Kyrgyzstan  just over the last few weeks  unprecedented levels of violence occurred between ethnic Kyrgyz and ethnic Uzbeks. Hundreds have been killed  and more than         displaced  including many ethnic Uzbeks who fled to neighboring Uzbekistan. In the Middle East  conflict between Israelis and Palestinians continues unabated  and it becomes ever more difficult to see how  just how a possible  sustainable solution can be achieved. Darfur may have slipped from the news headlines  but the killing and displacement there continues as well  and the sheer human misery that it creates is very hard to fathom. And in Iraq  finally  violence is on the rise again  and the country has yet to form a government four months after its last parliamentary elections. But hang on  this talk is to be about the good news. So are these now the images of the past  Well  notwithstanding the gloomy pictures from the Middle East  Darfur  Iraq  elsewhere  there is a longer term trend that does represent some good news. Over the past two decades  since the end of the Cold War  there has been an overall decline in the number of civil wars. Since the high in the early     s  with about    such civil wars ongoing  we now have    percent fewer such conflicts today. The number of people killed in civil wars also is much lower today than it was a decade ago or two. But this trend is less unambiguous. The highest level of deaths on the battlefield was recorded between      and       with about        soldiers  policemen and rebels killed every year. The lowest number of combatant casualties occurred in       with just        killed. Despite the up and down since then  the overall trend    and this is the important bit    clearly points downward for the past two decades. The news about civilian casualties is also less bad than it used to be. From over        civilians deliberately killed in civil wars in      and       a decade later  this figure stands at      . This is a decrease by two thirds. This decline would be even more obvious if we factored in the genocide in Rwanda in     . But then         civilians were slaughtered in a matter of just a few months. This certainly is an accomplishment that must never be surpassed. What is also important is to note that these figures only tell part of the story. They exclude people that died as a consequence of civil war  from hunger or disease  for example. And they also do not properly account for civilian suffering more generally. Torture  rape and ethnic cleansing have become highly effective  if often non lethal  weapons in civil war. To put it differently  for the civilians that suffer the consequences of ethnic conflict and civil war  there is no good war and there is no bad peace. Thus  even though every civilian killed  maimed  raped  or tortured is one too many  the fact that the number of civilian casualties is clearly lower today than it was a decade ago  is good news. So  we have fewer conflicts today in which fewer people get killed. And the big question  of course  is why  In some cases  there is a military victory of one side. This is a solution of sorts  but rarely is it one that comes without human costs or humanitarian consequences. The defeat of the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka is perhaps the most recent example of this  but we have seen similar so called military solutions in the Balkans  in the South Caucasus and across most of Africa. At times  they are complimented by negotiated settlements  or at least cease fire agreements  and peacekeepers are deployed. But hardly ever do they represent a resounding success    Bosnia and Herzegovina perhaps more so than Georgia. But for many parts of Africa  a colleague of mine once put it this way   The cease fire on Tuesday night was reached just in time for the genocide to start on Wednesday morning.  But let's look at the good news again. If there's no solution on the battlefield  three factors can account for the prevention of ethnic conflict and civil war  or for sustainable peace afterwards  leadership  diplomacy and institutional design. Take the example of Northern Ireland. Despite centuries of animosity  decades of violence and thousands of people killed       saw the conclusion of an historic agreement. Its initial version was skillfully mediated by Senator George Mitchell. Crucially  for the long term success of the peace process in Northern Ireland  he imposed very clear conditions for the participation and negotiations. Central among them  a commitment to exclusively peaceful means. Subsequent revisions of the agreement were facilitated by the British and Irish governments  who never wavered in their determination to bring peace and stability to Northern Ireland. The core institutions that were put in place in      and their modifications in      and      were highly innovative and allowed all conflict parties to see their core concerns and demands addressed. The agreement combines a power sharing arrangement in Northern Ireland with cross border institutions that link Belfast and Dublin and thus recognizes the so called Irish dimension of the conflict. And significantly  there's also a clear focus on both the rights of individuals and the rights of communities. The provisions in the agreement may be complex  but so is the underlying conflict. Perhaps most importantly  local leaders repeatedly rose to the challenge of compromise  not always fast and not always enthusiastically  but rise in the end they did. Who ever could have imagined Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness jointly governing Northern Ireland as First and Deputy First Minister  But then  is Northern Ireland a unique example  or does this kind of explanation only hold more generally in democratic and developed countries  By no means. The ending of Liberia's long lasting civil war in      illustrates the importance of leadership  diplomacy and institutional design as much as the successful prevention of a full scale civil war in Macedonia in       or the successful ending of the conflict in Aceh in Indonesia in     . In all three cases  local leaders were willing and able to make peace  the international community stood ready to help them negotiate and implement an agreement  and the institutions have lived up to the promise that they held on the day they were agreed. Focusing on leadership  diplomacy and institutional design also helps explain failures to achieve peace  or to make it last. The hopes that were vested in the Oslo Accords did not lead to an end of the Israeli Palestinian conflict. Not all the issues that needed to be resolved were actually covered in the agreements. Rather  local leaders committed to revisiting them later on. Yet instead of grasping this opportunity  local and international leaders soon disengaged and became distracted by the second Intifada  the events of      and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The comprehensive peace agreement for Sudan signed in      turned out to be less comprehensive than envisaged  and its provisions may yet bear the seeds of a full scale return to war between north and south. Changes and shortcomings in leadership  more off than on international diplomacy and institutional failures account for this in almost equal measure. Unresolved boundary issues  squabbles over oil revenues  the ongoing conflict in Darfur  escalating tribal violence in the south and generally weak state capacity across all of Sudan complete a very depressing picture of the state of affairs in Africa's largest country. A final example  Kosovo. The failure to achieve a negotiated solution for Kosovo and the violence  tension and de facto partition that resulted from it have their reasons in many  many different factors. Central among them are three. First  the intransigence of local leaders to settle for nothing less than their maximum demands. Second  an international diplomatic effort that was hampered from the beginning by Western support for Kosovo's independence. And third  a lack of imagination when it came to designing institutions that could have addressed the concerns of Serbs and Albanians alike. By the same token    and here we have some good news again    the very fact that there is a high level  well resourced international presence in Kosovo and the Balkans region more generally and the fact that local leaders on both sides have showed relative restraint  explains why things have not been worse over the past two years since     . So even in situations where outcomes are less than optimal  local leaders and international leaders have a choice  and they can make a difference for the better. A cold war is not as good as a cold peace  but a cold peace is still better than a hot war. Good news is also about learning the right lesson. So what then distinguishes the Israeli Palestinian conflict from that in Northern Ireland  or the civil war in Sudan from that in Liberia  Both successes and failures teach us several critically important things that we need to bear in mind if we want the good news to continue. First  leadership. In the same way in which ethnic conflict and civil war are not natural but man made disasters  their prevention and settlement does not happen automatically either. Leadership needs to be capable  determined and visionary in its commitment to peace. Leaders need to connect to each other and to their followers  and they need to bring them along on what is an often arduous journey into a peaceful future. Second  diplomacy. Diplomacy needs to be well resourced  sustained  and apply the right mix of incentives and pressures on leaders and followers. It needs to help them reach an equitable compromise  and it needs to ensure that a broad coalition of local  regional and international supporters help them implement their agreement. Third  institutional design. Institutional design requires a keen focus on issues  innovative thinking and flexible and well funded implementation. Conflict parties need to move away from maximum demands and towards a compromise that recognizes each other's needs. And they need to think about the substance of their agreement much more than about the labels they want to attach to them. Conflict parties also need to be prepared to return to the negotiation table if the agreement implementation stalls. For me personally  the most critical lesson of all is this  Local commitment to peace is all important  but it is often not enough to prevent or end violence. Yet  no amount of diplomacy or institutional design can make up for local failures and the consequences that they have. Therefore  we must invest in developing leaders  leaders that have the skills  vision and determination to make peace. Leaders  in other words  that people will trust and that they will want to follow even if that means making hard choices. A final thought  Ending civil wars is a process that is fraught with dangers  frustrations and setbacks. It often takes a generation to accomplish  but it also requires us  today's generation  to take responsibility and to learn the right lessons about leadership  diplomacy and institutional design  so that the child soldiers of today can become the children of tomorrow. Thank you. I'm here today to show my photographs of the Lakota. Many of you may have heard of the Lakota  or at least the larger group of tribes called the Sioux. The Lakota are one of many tribes that were moved off their land to prisoner of war camps now called reservations. The Pine Ridge Reservation  the subject of today's slide show  is located about    miles southeast of the Black Hills in South Dakota. It is sometimes referred to as Prisoner of War Camp Number      and it is where the Lakota now live. Now  if any of you have ever heard of AIM  the American Indian Movement  or of Russell Means  or Leonard Peltier  or of the stand off at Oglala  then you know that Pine Ridge is ground zero for Native issues in the U.S. So I've been asked to talk a little bit today about my relationship with the Lakota  and that's a very difficult one for me. Because  if you haven't noticed from my skin color  I'm white  and that is a huge barrier on a Native reservation. You'll see a lot of people in my photographs today  and I've become very close with them  and they've welcomed me like family. They've called me  brother  and  uncle  and invited me again and again over five years. But on Pine Ridge  I will always be what is called  wasichu   and  wasichu  is a Lakota word that means  non Indian   but another version of this word means  the one who takes the best meat for himself.  And that's what I want to focus on    the one who takes the best part of the meat. It means greedy. So take a look around this auditorium today. We are at a private school in the American West  sitting in red velvet chairs with money in our pockets. And if we look at our lives  we have indeed taken the best part of the meat. So let's look today at a set of photographs of a people who lost so that we could gain  and know that when you see these people's faces that these are not just images of the Lakota  they stand for all indigenous people. On this piece of paper is the history the way I learned it from my Lakota friends and family. The following is a time line of treaties made  treaties broken and massacres disguised as battles. I'll begin in     . What is known as the Bureau of Indian Affairs was created within the War Department  setting an early tone of aggression in our dealings with the Native Americans.       The first treaty of Fort Laramie was made  clearly marking the boundaries of the Lakota Nation. According to the treaty  those lands are a sovereign nation. If the boundaries of this treaty had held    and there is a legal basis that they should    then this is what the U.S. would look like today.    years later  the Homestead Act  signed by President Lincoln  unleashed a flood of white settlers into Native lands.       An uprising of Santee Sioux in Minnesota ends with the hanging of    Sioux men  the largest mass execution in U.S. history. The execution was ordered by President Lincoln only two days after he signed the Emancipation Proclamation.       the beginning of the transcontinental railroad    a new era. We appropriated land for trails and trains to shortcut through the heart of the Lakota Nation. The treaties were out the window. In response  three tribes led by the Lakota chief Red Cloud attacked and defeated the U.S. army many times over. I want to repeat that part. The Lakota defeat the U.S. army.       The second Fort Laramie Treaty clearly guarantees the sovereignty of the Great Sioux Nation and the Lakotas' ownership of the sacred Black Hills. The government also promises land and hunting rights in the surrounding states. We promise that the Powder River country will henceforth be closed to all whites. The treaty seemed to be a complete victory for Red Cloud and the Sioux. In fact  this is the only war in American history in which the government negotiated a peace by conceding everything demanded by the enemy.       The transcontinental railroad was completed. It began carrying  among other things  a large number of hunters who began the wholesale killing of buffalo  eliminating a source of food and clothing and shelter for the Sioux.       The Indian Appropriation Act makes all Indians wards of the federal government. In addition  the military issued orders forbidding western Indians from leaving reservations. All western Indians at that point in time were now prisoners of war. Also in       we ended the time of treaty making. The problem with treaties is they allow tribes to exist as sovereign nations  and we can't have that. We had plans.       General George Custer announced the discovery of gold in Lakota territory  specifically the Black Hills. The news of gold creates a massive influx of white settlers into Lakota Nation. Custer recommends that Congress find a way to end the treaties with the Lakota as soon as possible.       The Lakota war begins over the violation of the Fort Laramie Treaty.       On July   th on its way to attack a Lakota village  Custer's  th Cavalry was crushed at the battle of Little Big Horn.       The great Lakota warrior and chief named Crazy Horse surrendered at Fort Robinson. He was later killed while in custody.      is also the year we found a way to get around the Fort Laramie Treaties. A new agreement was presented to Sioux chiefs and their leading men under a campaign known as  sell or starve   Sign the paper  or no food for your tribe. Only    percent of the adult male population signed. The Fort Laramie Treaty called for at least three quarters of the tribe to sign away land. That clause was obviously ignored.       The Dawes Act. Communal ownership of reservation lands ends. Reservations are cut up into     acre sections and distributed to individual Indians with the surplus disposed of. Tribes lost millions of acres. The American dream of individual land ownership turned out to be a very clever way to divide the reservation until nothing was left. The move destroyed the reservations  making it easier to further subdivide and to sell with every passing generation. Most of the surplus land and many of the plots within reservation boundaries are now in the hands of white ranchers. Once again  the fat of the land goes to wasichu.       a date I believe to be the most important in this slide show. This is the year of the Wounded Knee Massacre. On December   th  U.S. troops surrounded a Sioux encampment at Wounded Knee Creek and massacred Chief Big Foot and     prisoners of war  using a new rapid fire weapon that fired exploding shells called a Hotchkiss gun. For this so called  battle      Congressional Medals of Honor for Valor were given to the  th Cavalry. To this day  this is the most Medals of Honor ever awarded for a single battle. More Medals of Honor were given for the indiscriminate slaughter of women and children than for any battle in World War One  World War Two  Korea  Vietnam  Iraq or Afghanistan. The Wounded Knee massacre is considered the end of the Indian wars. Whenever I visit the site of the mass grave at Wounded Knee  I see it not just as a grave for the Lakota or for the Sioux  but as a grave for all indigenous peoples. The holy man  Black Elk  said   I did not know then how much was ended. When I look back now from this high hill of my old age  I can still see the butchered women and children lying heaped and scattered all along the crooked gulch as plain as when I saw them with eyes still young. And I can see that something else died there in the bloody mud and was buried in the blizzard  A people's dream died there  and it was a beautiful dream.  With this event  a new era in Native American history began. Everything can be measured before Wounded Knee and after. Because it was in this moment with the fingers on the triggers of the Hotchkiss guns that the U.S. government openly declared its position on Native rights. They were tired of treaties. They were tired of sacred hills. They were tired of ghost dances. And they were tired of all the inconveniences of the Sioux. So they brought out their cannons.  You want to be an Indian now   they said  finger on the trigger.       the U.S. Indian population reached its low point    less than          compared to an estimated eight million in     . Fast forward.       The longest running court case in U.S. history  the Sioux Nation v. the United States  was ruled upon by the U.S. Supreme Court. The court determined that  when the Sioux were resettled onto reservations and seven million acres of their land were opened up to prospectors and homesteaders  the terms of the second Fort Laramie Treaty had been violated. The court stated that the Black Hills were illegally taken and that the initial offering price plus interest should be paid to the Sioux Nation. As payment for the Black Hills  the court awarded only     million dollars to the Sioux Nation. The Sioux refused the money with the rallying cry   The Black Hills are not for sale.        Statistics about Native population today  more than a century after the massacre at Wounded Knee  reveal the legacy of colonization  forced migration and treaty violations. Unemployment on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation fluctuates between    and    percent. The housing office is unable to build new structures  and existing structures are falling apart. Many are homeless  and those with homes are packed into rotting buildings with up to five families.    percent of homes on Pine Ridge have no electricity. At least    percent of the homes on the reservation are infested with black mold. More than    percent of the population lives below the federal poverty line. The tuberculosis rate on Pine Ridge is approximately eight times higher than the U.S. national average. The infant mortality rate is the highest on this continent and is about three times higher than the U.S. national average. Cervical cancer is five times higher than the U.S. national average. School dropout rate is up to    percent. Teacher turnover is eight times higher than the U.S. national average. Frequently  grandparents are raising their grandchildren because parents  due to alcoholism  domestic violence and general apathy  cannot raise them.    percent of the population over the age of    suffers from diabetes. The life expectancy for men is between    and    years old    roughly the same as in Afghanistan and Somalia. The last chapter in any successful genocide is the one in which the oppressor can remove their hands and say   My God  what are these people doing to themselves  They're killing each other. They're killing themselves while we watch them die.  This is how we came to own these United States. This is the legacy of manifest destiny. Prisoners are still born into prisoner of war camps long after the guards are gone. These are the bones left after the best meat has been taken. A long time ago  a series of events was set in motion by a people who look like me  by wasichu  eager to take the land and the water and the gold in the hills. Those events led to a domino effect that has yet to end. As removed as we the dominant society may feel from a massacre in       or a series of broken treaties     years ago  I still have to ask you the question  how should you feel about the statistics of today  What is the connection between these images of suffering and the history that I just read to you  And how much of this history do you need to own  even  Is any of this your responsibility today  I have been told that there must be something we can do. There must be some call to action. Because for so long I've been standing on the sidelines content to be a witness  just taking photographs. Because the solution seems so far in the past  I needed nothing short of a time machine to access them. The suffering of indigenous peoples is not a simple issue to fix. It's not something everyone can get behind the way they get behind helping Haiti  or ending AIDS  or fighting a famine. The  fix   as it's called  may be much more difficult for the dominant society than  say  a     check or a church trip to paint some graffiti covered houses  or a suburban family donating a box of clothes they don't even want anymore. So where does that leave us  Shrugging our shoulders in the dark  The United States continues on a daily basis to violate the terms of the      and      Fort Laramie Treaties with the Lakota. The call to action I offer today    my TED wish    is this  Honor the treaties. Give back the Black Hills. It's not your business what they do with them. This cell phone started its trajectory in an artisanal mine in the Eastern Congo. It's mined by armed gangs using slaves  child slaves  what the U.N. Security Council calls  blood minerals   then traveled into some components and ended up in a factory in Shinjin in China. That factory    over a dozen people have committed suicide already this year. One man died after working a    hour shift. We all love chocolate. We buy it for our kids. Eighty percent of the cocoa comes from Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana and it's harvested by children. Cote d'Ivoire  we have a huge problem of child slaves. Children have been trafficked from other conflict zones to come and work on the coffee plantations. Heparin    a blood thinner  a pharmaceutical product    starts out in artisanal workshops like this in China  because the active ingredient comes from pigs' intestines. Your diamond    you've all heard  probably seen the movie  Blood Diamond.  This is a mine in Zimbabwe right now. Cotton  Uzbekistan is the second biggest exporter of cotton on Earth. Every year when it comes to the cotton harvest  the government shuts down the schools  puts the kids in buses  buses them to the cotton fields to spend three weeks harvesting the cotton. It's forced child labor on an institutional scale. And all of those products probably end their lives in a dump like this one in Manila. These places  these origins  represent governance gaps. That's the politest description I have for them. These are the dark pools where global supply chains begin    the global supply chains  which bring us our favorite brand name products. Some of these governance gaps are run by rogue states. Some of them are not states anymore at all. They're failed states. Some of them are just countries who believe that deregulation or no regulation is the best way to attract investment  promote trade. Either way  they present us with a huge moral and ethical dilemma. I know that none of us want to be accessories after the fact of a human rights abuse in a global supply chain. But right now  most of the companies involved in these supply chains don't have any way of assuring us that nobody had to mortgage their future  nobody had to sacrifice their rights to bring us our favorite brand name product. Now  I didn't come here to depress you about the state of the global supply chain. We need a reality check. We need to recognize just how serious a deficit of rights we have. This is an independent republic  probably a failed state. It's definitely not a democratic state. And right now  that independent republic of the supply chain is not being governed in a way that would satisfy us  that we can engage in ethical trade or ethical consumption. Now  that's not a new story. You've seen the documentaries of sweatshops making garments all over the world  even in developed countries. You want to see the classic sweatshop  meet me at Madison Square Garden  I'll take you down the street  and I'll show you a Chinese sweatshop. But take the example of heparin. It's a pharmaceutical product. You expect that the supply chain that gets it to the hospital  probably squeaky clean. The problem is that the active ingredient in there    as I mentioned earlier    comes from pigs. The main American manufacturer of that active ingredient decided a few years ago to relocate to China because it's the world's biggest supplier of pigs. And their factory in China    which probably is pretty clean    is getting all of the ingredients from backyard abattoirs  where families slaughter pigs and extract the ingredient. So a couple of years ago  we had a scandal which killed about    people around the world  because of contaminants that crept into the heparin supply chain. Worse  some of the suppliers realized that they could substitute a product which mimicked heparin in tests. This substitute cost nine dollars a pound  whereas real heparin  the real ingredient  cost     dollars a pound. A no brainer. The problem was that it killed more people. And so you're asking yourself   How come the U.S. Food and Drug Administration allowed this to happen  How did the Chinese State Agency for Food and Drugs allow this to happen   And the answer is quite simple  the Chinese define these facilities as chemical facilities  not pharmaceutical facilities  so they don't audit them. And the USFDA has a jurisdictional problem. This is offshore. They actually do conduct a few investigations overseas    about a dozen a year    maybe    in a good year. There are     of these facilities producing active ingredients in China alone. In fact  about    percent of the active ingredients in medicines now come from offshore  particularly China and India  and we don't have a governance system. We don't have a regulatory system able to ensure that that production is safe. We don't have a system to ensure that human rights  basic dignity  are ensured. So at a national level    and we work in about    different countries    at a national level we've got a serious breakdown in the ability of governments to regulate production on their own soil. And the real problem with the global supply chain is that it's supranational. So governments who are failing  who are dropping the ball at a national level  have even less ability to get their arms around the problem at an international level. And you can just look at the headlines. Take Copenhagen last year    complete failure of governments to do the right thing in the face of an international challenge. Take the G   meeting a couple of weeks ago    stepped back from its commitments of just a few months ago. You can take any one of the major global challenges we've discussed this week and ask yourself  where is the leadership from governments to step up and come up with solutions  responses  to those international problems  And the simple answer is they can't. They're national. Their voters are local. They have parochial interests. They can't subordinate those interests to the greater global public good. So  if we're going to ensure the delivery of the key public goods at an international level    in this case  in the global supply chain    we have to come up with a different mechanism. We need a different machine. Fortunately  we have some examples. In the     s  there were a whole series of scandals concerning the production of brand name goods in the U.S.    child labor  forced labor  serious health and safety abuses. And eventually President Clinton  in       convened a meeting at the White House  invited industry  human rights NGOs  trade unions  the Department of Labor  got them all in a room and said   Look  I don't want globalization to be a race to the bottom. I don't know how to prevent that  but I'm at least going to use my good offices to get you folks together to come up with a response.  So they formed a White House task force  and they spent about three years arguing about who takes how much responsibility in the global supply chain. Companies didn't feel it was their responsibility. They don't own those facilities. They don't employ those workers. They're not legally liable. Everybody else at the table said   Folks  that doesn't cut it. You have a custodial duty  a duty of care  to make sure that that product gets from wherever to the store in a way that allows us to consume it  without fear of our safety  or without having to sacrifice our conscience to consume that product.  So they agreed   Okay  what we'll do is we agree on a common set of standards  code of conduct. We'll apply that throughout our global supply chain regardless of ownership or control. We'll make it part of the contract.  And that was a stroke of absolute genius  because what they did was they harnessed the power of the contract  private power  to deliver public goods. And let's face it  the contract from a major multinational brand to a supplier in India or China has much more persuasive value than the local labor law  the local environmental regulations  the local human rights standards. Those factories will probably never see an inspector. If the inspector did come along  it would be amazing if they were able to resist the bribe. Even if they did their jobs  and they cited those facilities for their violations  the fine would be derisory. But you lose that contract for a major brand name  that's the difference between staying in business or going bankrupt. That makes a difference. So what we've been able to do is we've been able to harness the power and the influence of the only truly transnational institution in the global supply chain  that of the multinational company  and get them to do the right thing  get them to use that power for good  to deliver the key public goods. Now of course  this doesn't come naturally to multinational companies. They weren't set up to do this. They're set up to make money. But they are extremely efficient organizations. They have resources  and if we can add the will  the commitment  they know how to deliver that product. Now  getting there is not easy. Those supply chains I put up on the screen earlier  they're not there. You need a safe space. You need a place where people can come together  sit down without fear of judgment  without recrimination  to actually face the problem  agree on the problem and come up with solutions. We can do it. The technical solutions are there. The problem is the lack of trust  the lack of confidence  the lack of partnership between NGOs  campaign groups  civil society organizations and multinational companies. If we can put those two together in a safe space  get them to work together  we can deliver public goods right now  or in extremely short supply. This is a radical proposition  and it's crazy to think that if you're a    year old Bangladeshi girl leaving your rural village to go and work in a factory in Dhaka               dollars a month    your best chance of enjoying rights at work is if that factory is producing for a brand name company which has got a code of conduct and made that code of conduct part of the contract. It's crazy. Multinationals are protecting human rights. I know there's going to be disbelief. You'll say   How can we trust them   Well  we don't. It's the old arms control phrase   Trust  but verify.  So we audit. We take their supply chain  we take all the factory names  we do a random sample  we send inspectors on an unannounced basis to inspect those facilities  and then we publish the results. Transparency is absolutely critical to this. You can call yourself responsible  but responsibility without accountability often doesn't work. So what we're doing is  we're not only enlisting the multinationals  we're giving them the tools to deliver this public good    respect for human rights    and we're checking. You don't need to believe me. You shouldn't believe me. Go to the website. Look at the audit results. Ask yourself  is this company behaving in a socially responsible way  Can I buy that product without compromising my ethics  That's the way the system works. I hate the idea that governments are not protecting human rights around the world. I hate the idea that governments have dropped this ball and I can't get used to the idea that somehow we can't get them to do their jobs. I've been at this for    years  and in that time I've seen the ability  the commitment  the will of government to do this decline  and I don't see them making a comeback right now. So we started out thinking this was a stopgap measure. We're now thinking that  in fact  this is probably the start of a new way of regulating and addressing international challenges. Call it network governance. Call it what you will. The private actors  companies and NGOs  are going to have to get together to face the major challenges we are going to face. Just look at pandemics    swine flu  bird flu  H N . Look at the health systems in so many countries. Do they have the resources to face up to a serious pandemic  No. Could the private sector and NGOs get together and marshal a response  Absolutely. What they lack is that safe space to come together  agree and move to action. That's what we're trying to provide. I know as well that this often seems like an overwhelming level of responsibility for people to assume.  You want me to deliver human rights throughout my global supply chain. There are thousands of suppliers in there.  It seems too daunting  too dangerous  for any company to take on. But there are companies. We have       companies who are members. Some of them are very  very large companies. The sporting goods industry  in particular  stepped up to the plate and have done it. The example  the role model  is there. And whenever we discuss one of these problems that we have to address    child labor in cottonseed farms in India    this year we will monitor        cottonseed farms in India. It seems overwhelming. The numbers just make you want to zone out. But we break it down to some basic realities. And human rights comes down to a very simple proposition  can I give this person their dignity back  Poor people  people whose human rights have been violated    the crux of that is the loss of dignity  the lack of dignity. It starts with just giving people back their dignity. I was sitting in a slum outside Gurgaon just next to Delhi  one of the flashiest  brightest new cities popping up in India right now  and I was talking to workers who worked in garment sweatshops down the road  and I asked them what message they would like me to take to the brands. They didn't say money. They said   The people who employ us treat us like we are less than human  like we don't exist. Please ask them to treat us like human beings.  That's my simple understanding of human rights. That's my simple proposition to you  my simple plea to every decision maker in this room  everybody out there. We can all make a decision to come together and pick up the balls and run with the balls that governments have dropped. If we don't do it  we're abandoning hope  we're abandoning our essential humanity  and I know that's not a place we want to be  and we don't have to be there. So I appeal to you. Join us  come into that safe space  and let's start to make this happen. Thank you very much. Do you ever feel completely overwhelmed when you're faced with a complex problem  Well  I hope to change that in less than three minutes. So  I hope to convince you that complex doesn't always equal complicated. So for me  a well crafted baguette  fresh out of the oven  is complex  but a curry onion green olive poppy cheese bread is complicated. I'm an ecologist  and I study complexity. I love complexity. And I study that in the natural world  the interconnectedness of species. So here's a food web  or a map of feeding links between species that live in Alpine Lakes in the mountains of California. And this is what happens to that food web when it's stocked with non native fish that never lived there before. All the grayed out species disappear. Some are actually on the brink of extinction. And lakes with fish have more mosquitos  even though they eat them. These effects were all unanticipated  and yet we're discovering they're predictable. So I want to share with you a couple key insights about complexity we're learning from studying nature that maybe are applicable to other problems. First is the simple power of good visualization tools to help untangle complexity and just encourage you to ask questions you didn't think of before. For example  you could plot the flow of carbon through corporate supply chains in a corporate ecosystem  or the interconnections of habitat patches for endangered species in Yosemite National Park. The next thing is that if you want to predict the effect of one species on another  if you focus only on that link  and then you black box the rest  it's actually less predictable than if you step back  consider the entire system    all the species  all the links    and from that place  hone in on the sphere of influence that matters most. And we're discovering  with our research  that's often very local to the node you care about within one or two degrees. So the more you step back  embrace complexity  the better chance you have of finding simple answers  and it's often different than the simple answer that you started with. So let's switch gears and look at a really complex problem courtesy of the U.S. government. This is a diagram of the U.S. counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan. It was front page of the New York Times a couple months ago. Instantly ridiculed by the media for being so crazy complicated. And the stated goal was to increase popular support for the Afghan government. Clearly a complex problem  but is it complicated  Well  when I saw this in the front page of the Times  I thought   Great. Finally something I can relate to. I can sink my teeth into this.  So let's do it. So here we go for the first time ever  a world premiere view of this spaghetti diagram as an ordered network. The circled node is the one we're trying to influence    popular support for the government. And so now we can look one degrees  two degrees  three degrees away from that node and eliminate three quarters of the diagram outside that sphere of influence. Within that sphere  most of those nodes are not actionable  like the harshness of the terrain  and a very small minority are actual military actions. Most are non violent and they fall into two broad categories  active engagement with ethnic rivalries and religious beliefs and fair  transparent economic development and provisioning of services. I don't know about this  but this is what I can decipher from this diagram in    seconds. When you see a diagram like this  I don't want you to be afraid. I want you to be excited. I want you to be relieved. Because simple answers may emerge. We're discovering in nature that simplicity often lies on the other side of complexity. So for any problem  the more you can zoom out and embrace complexity  the better chance you have of zooming in on the simple details that matter most. Thank you. We've got a real problem with math education right now. Basically  no one's very happy. Those learning it think it's disconnected  uninteresting and hard. Those trying to employ them think they don't know enough. Governments realize that it's a big deal for our economies  but don't know how to fix it. And teachers are also frustrated. Yet math is more important to the world than at any point in human history. So at one end we've got falling interest in education in math  and at the other end we've got a more mathematical world  a more quantitative world than we ever have had. So what's the problem  why has this chasm opened up  and what can we do to fix it  Well actually  I think the answer is staring us right in the face  Use computers. I believe that correctly using computers is the silver bullet for making math education work. So to explain that  let me first talk a bit about what math looks like in the real world and what it looks like in education. See  in the real world math isn't necessarily done by mathematicians. It's done by geologists  engineers  biologists  all sorts of different people    modeling and simulation. It's actually very popular. But in education it looks very different    dumbed down problems  lots of calculating  mostly by hand. Lots of things that seem simple and not difficult like in the real world  except if you're learning it. And another thing about math  math sometimes looks like math    like in this example here    and sometimes it doesn't    like  Am I drunk   And then you get an answer that's quantitative in the modern world. You wouldn't have expected that a few years back. But now you can find out all about    unfortunately  my weight is a little higher than that  but    all about what happens. So let's zoom out a bit and ask  why are we teaching people math  What's the point of teaching people math  And in particular  why are we teaching them math in general  Why is it such an important part of education as a sort of compulsory subject  Well  I think there are about three reasons  technical jobs so critical to the development of our economies  what I call  everyday living     to function in the world today  you've got to be pretty quantitative  much more so than a few years ago  figure out your mortgages  being skeptical of government statistics  those kinds of things    and thirdly  what I would call something like logical mind training  logical thinking. Over the years we've put so much in society into being able to process and think logically. It's part of human society. It's very important to learn that math is a great way to do that. So let's ask another question. What is math  What do we mean when we say we're doing math  or educating people to do math  Well  I think it's about four steps  roughly speaking  starting with posing the right question. What is it that we want to ask  What is it we're trying to find out here  And this is the thing most screwed up in the outside world  beyond virtually any other part of doing math. People ask the wrong question  and surprisingly enough  they get the wrong answer  for that reason  if not for others. So the next thing is take that problem and turn it from a real world problem into a math problem. That's stage two. Once you've done that  then there's the computation step. Turn it from that into some answer in a mathematical form. And of course  math is very powerful at doing that. And then finally  turn it back to the real world. Did it answer the question  And also verify it    crucial step. Now here's the crazy thing right now. In math education  we're spending about perhaps    percent of the time teaching people to do step three by hand. Yet  that's the one step computers can do better than any human after years of practice. Instead  we ought to be using computers to do step three and using the students to spend much more effort on learning how to do steps one  two and four    conceptualizing problems  applying them  getting the teacher to run them through how to do that. See  crucial point here  math is not equal to calculating. Math is a much broader subject than calculating. Now it's understandable that this has all got intertwined over hundreds of years. There was only one way to do calculating and that was by hand. But in the last few decades that has totally changed. We've had the biggest transformation of any ancient subject that I could ever imagine with computers. Calculating was typically the limiting step  and now often it isn't. So I think in terms of the fact that math has been liberated from calculating. But that math liberation didn't get into education yet. See  I think of calculating  in a sense  as the machinery of math. It's the chore. It's the thing you'd like to avoid if you can  like to get a machine to do. It's a means to an end  not an end in itself  and automation allows us to have that machinery. Computers allow us to do that    and this is not a small problem by any means. I estimated that  just today  across the world  we spent about     average world lifetimes teaching people how to calculate by hand. That's an amazing amount of human endeavor. So we better be damn sure    and by the way  they didn't even have fun doing it  most of them    so we better be damn sure that we know why we're doing that and it has a real purpose. I think we should be assuming computers for doing the calculating and only doing hand calculations where it really makes sense to teach people that. And I think there are some cases. For example  mental arithmetic. I still do a lot of that  mainly for estimating. People say   Is such and such true   And I'll say   Hmm  not sure.  I'll think about it roughly. It's still quicker to do that and more practical. So I think practicality is one case where it's worth teaching people by hand. And then there are certain conceptual things that can also benefit from hand calculating  but I think they're relatively small in number. One thing I often ask about is ancient Greek and how this relates. See  the thing we're doing right now is we're forcing people to learn mathematics. It's a major subject. I'm not for one minute suggesting that  if people are interested in hand calculating or in following their own interests in any subject however bizarre    they should do that. That's absolutely the right thing  for people to follow their self interest. I was somewhat interested in ancient Greek  but I don't think that we should force the entire population to learn a subject like ancient Greek. I don't think it's warranted. So I have this distinction between what we're making people do and the subject that's sort of mainstream and the subject that  in a sense  people might follow with their own interest and perhaps even be spiked into doing that. So what are the issues people bring up with this  Well one of them is  they say  you need to get the basics first. You shouldn't use the machine until you get the basics of the subject. So my usual question is  what do you mean by  basics   Basics of what  Are the basics of driving a car learning how to service it  or design it for that matter  Are the basics of writing learning how to sharpen a quill  I don't think so. I think you need to separate the basics of what you're trying to do from how it gets done and the machinery of how it gets done and automation allows you to make that separation. A hundred years ago  it's certainly true that to drive a car you kind of needed to know a lot about the mechanics of the car and how the ignition timing worked and all sorts of things. But automation in cars allowed that to separate  so driving is now a quite separate subject  so to speak  from engineering of the car or learning how to service it. So automation allows this separation and also allows    in the case of driving  and I believe also in the future case of maths    a democratized way of doing that. It can be spread across a much larger number of people who can really work with that. So there's another thing that comes up with basics. People confuse  in my view  the order of the invention of the tools with the order in which they should use them for teaching. So just because paper was invented before computers  it doesn't necessarily mean you get more to the basics of the subject by using paper instead of a computer to teach mathematics. My daughter gave me a rather nice anecdote on this. She enjoys making what she calls  paper laptops.  So I asked her one day   You know  when I was your age  I didn't make these. Why do you think that was   And after a second or two  carefully reflecting  she said   No paper   If you were born after computers and paper  it doesn't really matter which order you're taught with them in  you just want to have the best tool. So another one that comes up is  Computers dumb math down.  That somehow  if you use a computer  it's all mindless button pushing  but if you do it by hand  it's all intellectual. This one kind of annoys me  I must say. Do we really believe that the math that most people are doing in school practically today is more than applying procedures to problems they don't really understand  for reasons they don't get  I don't think so. And what's worse  what they're learning there isn't even practically useful anymore. Might have been    years ago  but it isn't anymore. When they're out of education  they do it on a computer. Just to be clear  I think computers can really help with this problem  actually make it more conceptual. Now  of course  like any great tool  they can be used completely mindlessly  like turning everything into a multimedia show  like the example I was shown of solving an equation by hand  where the computer was the teacher    show the student how to manipulate and solve it by hand. This is just nuts. Why are we using computers to show a student how to solve a problem by hand that the computer should be doing anyway  All backwards. Let me show you that you can also make problems harder to calculate. See  normally in school  you do things like solve quadratic equations. But you see  when you're using a computer  you can just substitute. You can make it a quartic equation. Make it kind of harder  calculating wise. Same principles applied    calculations  harder. And problems in the real world look nutty and horrible like this. They've got hair all over them. They're not just simple  dumbed down things that we see in school math. And think of the outside world. Do we really believe that engineering and biology and all of these other things that have so benefited from computers and maths have somehow conceptually gotten reduced by using computers  I don't think so    quite the opposite. So the problem we've really got in math education is not that computers might dumb it down  but that we have dumbed down problems right now. Well  another issue people bring up is somehow that hand calculating procedures teach understanding. So if you go through lots of examples  you can get the answer  you can understand how the basics of the system work better. I think there is one thing that I think very valid here  which is that I think understanding procedures and processes is important. But there's a fantastic way to do that in the modern world. It's called programming. Programming is how most procedures and processes get written down these days  and it's also a great way to engage students much more and to check they really understand. If you really want to check you understand math then write a program to do it. So programming is the way I think we should be doing that. So to be clear  what I really am suggesting here is we have a unique opportunity to make maths both more practical and more conceptual  simultaneously. I can't think of any other subject where that's recently been possible. It's usually some kind of choice between the vocational and the intellectual. But I think we can do both at the same time here. And we open up so many more possibilities. You can do so many more problems. What I really think we gain from this is students getting intuition and experience in far greater quantities than they've ever got before. And experience of harder problems    being able to play with the math  interact with it  feel it. We want people who can feel the math instinctively. That's what computers allow us to do. Another thing it allows us to do is reorder the curriculum. Traditionally it's been by how difficult it is to calculate  but now we can reorder it by how difficult it is to understand the concepts  however hard the calculating. So calculus has traditionally been taught very late. Why is this  Well  it's damn hard doing the calculations  that's the problem. But actually many of the concepts are amenable to a much younger age group. This was an example I built for my daughter. And very  very simple. We were talking about what happens when you increase the number of sides of a polygon to a very large number. And of course  it turns into a circle. And by the way  she was also very insistent on being able to change the color  an important feature for this demonstration. You can see that this is a very early step into limits and differential calculus and what happens when you take things to an extreme    and very small sides and a very large number of sides. Very simple example. That's a view of the world that we don't usually give people for many  many years after this. And yet  that's a really important practical view of the world. So one of the roadblocks we have in moving this agenda forward is exams. In the end  if we test everyone by hand in exams  it's kind of hard to get the curricula changed to a point where they can use computers during the semesters. And one of the reasons it's so important    so it's very important to get computers in exams. And then we can ask questions  real questions  questions like  what's the best life insurance policy to get     real questions that people have in their everyday lives. And you see  this isn't some dumbed down model here. This is an actual model where we can be asked to optimize what happens. How many years of protection do I need  What does that do to the payments and to the interest rates and so forth  Now I'm not for one minute suggesting it's the only kind of question that should be asked in exams  but I think it's a very important type that right now just gets completely ignored and is critical for people's real understanding. So I believe  there is  critical reform we have to do in computer based math. We have got to make sure that we can move our economies forward  and also our societies  based on the idea that people can really feel mathematics. This isn't some optional extra. And the country that does this first will  in my view  leapfrog others in achieving a new economy even  an improved economy  an improved outlook. In fact  I even talk about us moving from what we often call now the  knowledge economy  to what we might call a  computational knowledge economy   where high level math is integral to what everyone does in the way that knowledge currently is. We can engage so many more students with this  and they can have a better time doing it. And let's understand  this is not an incremental sort of change. We're trying to cross the chasm here between school math and the real world math. And you know if you walk across a chasm  you end up making it worse than if you didn't start at all    bigger disaster. No  what I'm suggesting is that we should leap off  we should increase our velocity so it's high  and we should leap off one side and go the other    of course  having calculated our differential equation very carefully. So I want to see a completely renewed  changed math curriculum built from the ground up  based on computers being there  computers that are now ubiquitous almost. Calculating machines are everywhere and will be completely everywhere in a small number of years. Now I'm not even sure if we should brand the subject as math  but what I am sure is it's the mainstream subject of the future. Let's go for it  and while we're about it  let's have a bit of fun  for us  for the students and for TED here. Thanks. Delighted to be here and to talk to you about a subject dear to my heart  which is beauty. I do the philosophy of art  aesthetics  actually  for a living. I try to figure out intellectually  philosophically  psychologically  what the experience of beauty is  what sensibly can be said about it and how people go off the rails in trying to understand it. Now this is an extremely complicated subject  in part because the things that we call beautiful are so different. I mean just think of the sheer variety    a baby's face  Berlioz's  Harold in Italy   movies like  The Wizard of Oz  or the plays of Chekhov  a central California landscape  a Hokusai view of Mt. Fuji   Der Rosenkavalier   a stunning match winning goal in a World Cup soccer match  Van Gogh's  Starry Night   a Jane Austen novel  Fred Astaire dancing across the screen. This brief list includes human beings  natural landforms  works of art and skilled human actions. An account that explains the presence of beauty in everything on this list is not going to be easy. I can  however  give you at least a taste of what I regard as the most powerful theory of beauty we yet have. And we get it not from a philosopher of art  not from a postmodern art theorist or a bigwig art critic. No  this theory comes from an expert on barnacles and worms and pigeon breeding  and you know who I mean  Charles Darwin. Of course  a lot of people think they already know the proper answer to the question   What is beauty   It's in the eye of the beholder. It's whatever moves you personally. Or  as some people  especially academics prefer  beauty is in the culturally conditioned eye of the beholder. People agree that paintings or movies or music are beautiful because their cultures determine a uniformity of aesthetic taste. Taste for both natural beauty and for the arts travel across cultures with great ease. Beethoven is adored in Japan. Peruvians love Japanese woodblock prints. Inca sculptures are regarded as treasures in British museums  while Shakespeare is translated into every major language of the Earth. Or just think about American jazz or American movies    they go everywhere. There are many differences among the arts  but there are also universal  cross cultural aesthetic pleasures and values. How can we explain this universality  The best answer lies in trying to reconstruct a Darwinian evolutionary history of our artistic and aesthetic tastes. We need to reverse engineer our present artistic tastes and preferences and explain how they came to be engraved in our minds by the actions of both our prehistoric  largely pleistocene environments  where we became fully human  but also by the social situations in which we evolved. This reverse engineering can also enlist help from the human record preserved in prehistory. I mean fossils  cave paintings and so forth. And it should take into account what we know of the aesthetic interests of isolated hunter gatherer bands that survived into the   th and the   th centuries. Now  I personally have no doubt whatsoever that the experience of beauty  with its emotional intensity and pleasure  belongs to our evolved human psychology. The experience of beauty is one component in a whole series of Darwinian adaptations. Beauty is an adaptive effect  which we extend and intensify in the creation and enjoyment of works of art and entertainment. As many of you will know  evolution operates by two main primary mechanisms. The first of these is natural selection    that's random mutation and selective retention    along with our basic anatomy and physiology    the evolution of the pancreas or the eye or the fingernails. Natural selection also explains many basic revulsions  such as the horrid smell of rotting meat  or fears  such as the fear of snakes or standing close to the edge of a cliff. Natural selection also explains pleasures    sexual pleasure  our liking for sweet  fat and proteins  which in turn explains a lot of popular foods  from ripe fruits through chocolate malts and barbecued ribs. The other great principle of evolution is sexual selection  and it operates very differently. The peacock's magnificent tail is the most famous example of this. It did not evolve for natural survival. In fact  it goes against natural survival. No  the peacock's tail results from the mating choices made by peahens. It's quite a familiar story. It's women who actually push history forward. Darwin himself  by the way  had no doubts that the peacock's tail was beautiful in the eyes of the peahen. He actually used that word. Now  keeping these ideas firmly in mind  we can say that the experience of beauty is one of the ways that evolution has of arousing and sustaining interest or fascination  even obsession  in order to encourage us toward making the most adaptive decisions for survival and reproduction. Beauty is nature's way of acting at a distance  so to speak. I mean  you can't expect to eat an adaptively beneficial landscape. It would hardly do to eat your baby or your lover. So evolution's trick is to make them beautiful  to have them exert a kind of magnetism to give you the pleasure of simply looking at them. Consider briefly an important source of aesthetic pleasure  the magnetic pull of beautiful landscapes. People in very different cultures all over the world tend to like a particular kind of landscape  a landscape that just happens to be similar to the pleistocene savannas where we evolved. This landscape shows up today on calendars  on postcards  in the design of golf courses and public parks and in gold framed pictures that hang in living rooms from New York to New Zealand. It's a kind of Hudson River school landscape featuring open spaces of low grasses interspersed with copses of trees. The trees  by the way  are often preferred if they fork near the ground  that is to say  if they're trees you could scramble up if you were in a tight fix. The landscape shows the presence of water directly in view  or evidence of water in a bluish distance  indications of animal or bird life as well as diverse greenery and finally    get this    a path or a road  perhaps a riverbank or a shoreline  that extends into the distance  almost inviting you to follow it. This landscape type is regarded as beautiful  even by people in countries that don't have it. The ideal savanna landscape is one of the clearest examples where human beings everywhere find beauty in similar visual experience. But  someone might argue  that's natural beauty. How about artistic beauty  Isn't that exhaustively cultural  No  I don't think it is. And once again  I'd like to look back to prehistory to say something about it. It is widely assumed that the earliest human artworks are the stupendously skillful cave paintings that we all know from Lascaux and Chauvet. Chauvet caves are about        years old  along with a few small  realistic sculptures of women and animals from the same period. But artistic and decorative skills are actually much older than that. Beautiful shell necklaces that look like something you'd see at an arts and crafts fair  as well as ochre body paint  have been found from around         years ago. But the most intriguing prehistoric artifacts are older even than this. I have in mind the so called Acheulian hand axes. The oldest stone tools are choppers from the Olduvai Gorge in East Africa. They go back about two and a half million years. These crude tools were around for thousands of centuries  until around  .  million years ago when Homo erectus started shaping single  thin stone blades  sometimes rounded ovals  but often in what are to our eyes an arresting  symmetrical pointed leaf or teardrop form. These Acheulian hand axes    they're named after St. Acheul in France  where finds were made in   th century    have been unearthed in their thousands  scattered across Asia  Europe and Africa  almost everywhere Homo erectus and Homo ergaster roamed. Now  the sheer numbers of these hand axes shows that they can't have been made for butchering animals. And the plot really thickens when you realize that  unlike other pleistocene tools  the hand axes often exhibit no evidence of wear on their delicate blade edges. And some  in any event  are too big to use for butchery. Their symmetry  their attractive materials and  above all  their meticulous workmanship are simply quite beautiful to our eyes  even today. So what were these ancient    I mean  they're ancient  they're foreign  but they're at the same time somehow familiar. What were these artifacts for  The best available answer is that they were literally the earliest known works of art  practical tools transformed into captivating aesthetic objects  contemplated both for their elegant shape and their virtuoso craftsmanship. Hand axes mark an evolutionary advance in human history    tools fashioned to function as what Darwinians call  fitness signals     that is to say  displays that are performances like the peacock's tail  except that  unlike hair and feathers  the hand axes are consciously cleverly crafted. Competently made hand axes indicated desirable personal qualities    intelligence  fine motor control  planning ability  conscientiousness and sometimes access to rare materials. Over tens of thousands of generations  such skills increased the status of those who displayed them and gained a reproductive advantage over the less capable. You know  it's an old line  but it has been shown to work     Why don't you come up to my cave  so I can show you my hand axes   Except  of course  what's interesting about this is that we can't be sure how that idea was conveyed  because the Homo erectus that made these objects did not have language. It's hard to grasp  but it's an incredible fact. This object was made by a hominid ancestor  Homo erectus or Homo ergaster  between        and         years before language. Stretching over a million years  the hand axe tradition is the longest artistic tradition in human and proto human history. By the end of the hand axe epic  Homo sapiens    as they were then called  finally    were doubtless finding new ways to amuse and amaze each other by  who knows  telling jokes  storytelling  dancing  or hairstyling. Yes  hairstyling    I insist on that. For us moderns  virtuoso technique is used to create imaginary worlds in fiction and in movies  to express intense emotions with music  painting and dance. But still  one fundamental trait of the ancestral personality persists in our aesthetic cravings  the beauty we find in skilled performances. From Lascaux to the Louvre to Carnegie Hall  human beings have a permanent innate taste for virtuoso displays in the arts. We find beauty in something done well. So the next time you pass a jewelry shop window displaying a beautifully cut teardrop shaped stone  don't be so sure it's just your culture telling you that that sparkling jewel is beautiful. Your distant ancestors loved that shape and found beauty in the skill needed to make it  even before they could put their love into words. Is beauty in the eye of the beholder  No  it's deep in our minds. It's a gift handed down from the intelligent skills and rich emotional lives of our most ancient ancestors. Our powerful reaction to images  to the expression of emotion in art  to the beauty of music  to the night sky  will be with us and our descendants for as long as the human race exists. Thank you. Mountain biking in Israel is something that I do with great passion and commitment. And when I'm on my bike  I feel that I connect with the profound beauty of Israel  and I feel that I'm united with this country's history and biblical law. And also  for me  biking is a matter of empowerment. When I reach the summit of a steep mountain in the middle of nowhere  I feel young  invincible  eternal. It's as if I'm connecting with some legacy or with some energy far greater than myself. You can see my fellow riders at the end of the picture  looking at me with some concern. And here is another picture of them. Unfortunately  I cannot show their faces  neither can I disclose their true names  and that's because my fellow riders are juvenile inmates  offenders spending time in a correction facility about    minutes' ride from here    well  like everything in Israel. And I've been riding with these kids once a week  every Tuesday  rain or shine  for the last four years and by now  they've become a very big part of my life. This story began four years ago. The correction facility where they are locked up happens to be right in the middle of one of my usual trips  and it's surrounded by barbed wires and electric gates and armed guards. So on one of these rides  I talked my way into the compound and went to see the warden. I told the warden that I wanted to start a mountain biking club in this place and that basically I wanted to take the kids from here to there. And I told him   Let's find a way in which I'll be able to take out    kids once a week to ride with in the summer in the country.  And the warden was quite amused  and he told me he thought that I was a nut and he told me   This place is a correction facility. These guys are serious offenders. They are supposed to be locked up. They aren't supposed to be out at large.  And yet  we began to talk about it  and one thing led to another. And I can't see myself going into a state prison in New Jersey and making such a proposition  but this being Israel  the warden somehow made it happen. And so two months later  we found ourselves  at large     myself     juvenile inmates and a wonderful fellow named Russ  who became a very good friend of mine and my partner in this project. And in the next few weeks  I had the tremendous pleasure of introducing these kids to the world of total freedom  a world consisting of magnificent vistas like these    everything you see here is obviously in Israel    as well as close encounters with all sorts of small creatures coming in all sorts of sizes  colors  shapes  forms and so on. In spite of all this splendor  the beginning was extremely frustrating. Every small obstacle  every slight uphill  would cause these fellows to stop in their tracks and give up. So we had a lot of this going on. I found out that they had a very hard time dealing with frustration and difficulties    not because they were physically unfit. But that's one reason why they ended up where they were. And I became increasingly more and more agitated  because I was there not only to be with them  but also to ride and create a team and I didn't know what to do. Now  let me give you an example. We're going downhill in some rocky terrain  and the front tire of Alex gets caught in one of these crevasses here. So he crashes down  and he gets slightly injured  but this does not prevent him from jumping up and then starting to jump up and down on his bike and curse violently. Then he throws his helmet in the air. His backpack goes ballistic in some other direction. And then he runs to the nearest tree and starts to break branches and throw rocks and curse like I've never heard. And I'm just standing there  watching this scene with a complete disbelief  not knowing what to do. I'm used to algorithms and data structures and super motivated students  and nothing in my background prepared me to deal with a raging  violent adolescent in the middle of nowhere. And you have to realize that these incidents did not happen in convenient locations. They happened in places like this  in the Judean Desert     kilometers away from the nearest road. And what you don't see in this picture is that somewhere between these riders there  there's a teenager sitting on a rock  saying   I'm not moving from here. Forget it. I've had it.  Well  that's a problem because one way or another  you have to get this guy moving because it's getting dark soon and dangerous. It took me several such incidents to figure out what I was supposed to do. At the beginning  it was a disaster. I tried harsh words and threats and they took me nowhere. That's what they had all their lives. And at some point I found out  when a kid like this gets into a fit  the best thing that you can possibly do is stay as close as possible to this kid  which is difficult  because what you really want to do is go away. But that's what he had all his life  people walking away from him. So what you have to do is stay close and try to reach in and pet his shoulder or give him a piece of chocolate. So I would say   Alex  I know that it's terribly difficult. Why don't you rest for a few minutes and then we'll go on.   Go away you maniac psychopath. Why would you bring us to this goddamn place   And I would say   Relax  Alex. Here's a piece of chocolate.  And Alex would go   Arrrrggg   Because you have to understand that on these rides we are constantly hungry    and after the rides also. And who is this guy  Alex  to begin with  He's a    year old. When he was eight  someone put him on a boat in Odessa and sent him  shipped him to Israel on his own. And he ended up in south Tel Aviv and did not have the good luck to be picked up by a  unclear  and roamed the streets and became a prominent gang member. And he spent the last    years of his life in two places only  the slums and the state prison  where he spent the last two years before he ended up sitting on this rock there. And so this kid was probably abused  abandoned  ignored  betrayed by almost every adult along the way. So  for such a kid  when an adult that he learns to respect stays close to him and doesn't walk away from him in any situation  irrespective of how he behaves  it's a tremendous healing experience. It's an act of unconditional acceptance  something that he never had. I want to say a few words about vision. When I started this program four years ago  I had this original plan of creating a team of winning underdogs. I had an image of Lance Armstrong in my mind. And it took me exactly two months of complete frustration to realize that this vision was misplaced  and that there was another vision supremely more important and more readily available. It all of a sudden dawned on me  in this project  that the purpose of these rides should actually be to expose the kids to one thing only  love. Love to the country  to the uphill and the downhill  to all the incredible creatures that surround us    the animals  the plants  the insects    love and respect to other fellow members in your team  in your biking team  and most importantly  love and respect to yourself  which is something that they badly miss. Together with the kids  I also went through a remarkable transformation. Now  I come from a cutthroat world of science and high technology. I used to think that reason and logic and relentless drive were the only ways to make things happen. And before I worked with the kids  anything that I did with them  or anything that I did with myself  was supposed to be perfect  ideal  optimal  but after working with them for some time  I discovered the great virtues of empathy and flexibility and being able to start with some vision  and if the vision doesn't work  well nothing happened. All you have to do is play with it  change it a little bit  and come up with something that does help  that does work. So right now  I feel more like these are my principles  and if you don't like them  I have others. And one of these principles is focus. Before each ride we sit together with the kids  and we give them one word to think about during the ride. You have to focus their attention on something because so many things happen. So these are words like  teamwork  or  endurance  or even complicated concepts like  resource allocation  or  perspective   a word that they don't understand. You know  perspective is one of these critically important life coping strategies that mountain biking can really teach you. I tell kids when they struggle through some uphill and feel like they cannot take it anymore  it really helps to ignore the immediate obstacles and raise your head and look around and see how the vista around you grows. It literally propels you upwards. That's what perspective is all about. Or you can also look back in time and realize that you've already conquered steeper mountains before. And that's how they develop self esteem. Now  let me give you an example of how it works. You stand with your bike at the beginning of February. It's very cold  and you're standing in one of these rainy days  and it's drizzling and cold and chilly  and you're standing in  let's say  Yokneam. And you look up at the sky through a hole in the clouds you see the monastery at the top of the Muhraka    that's where you're supposed to climb now    and you say   There's no way that I could possibly get there.  And yet  two hours later you find yourself standing on the roof of this monastery  smeared with mud  blood and sweat. And you look down at Yokneam  everything is so small and tiny. And you say   Hey  Alex. Look at this parking lot where we started. It's that big. I can't believe that I did it.  And that's the point when you start loving yourself. And so we talked about these special words that we teach them. And at the end of each ride  we sit together and share moments in which those special words of the day popped up and made a difference  and these discussions can be extremely inspiring. In one of them  one of the kids once said   When we were riding on this ridge overlooking the Dead Sea    and he's talking about this spot here     I was reminded of the day when I left my village in Ethiopia and went away together with my brother. We walked     kilometers until we reached Sudan. This was the first place where we got some water and supplies.  And he goes on saying  and everyone looks at him like a hero  probably for the first time in his life. And he says    because I also have volunteers riding with me  adults  who are sitting there listening to him    and he says   And this was just the beginning of our ordeal until we ended up in Israel. And only now   he says   I'm beginning to understand where I am  and I actually like it.  Now I remember  when he said it  I felt goosebumps on my body  because he said it overlooking the Moab Mountains here in the background. That's where Joshua descended and crossed the Jordan and led the people of Israel into the land of Canaan       years ago in this final leg of the journey from Africa. And so  perspective and context and history play key roles in the way I plan my rides with the kids. We visit Kibbutzim that were established by Holocaust survivors. We explore ruins of Palestinian villages  and we discuss how they became ruins. And we go through numerous remnants of Jewish settlements  Nabatic settlements  Canaanite settlements    three   four  five thousand years old. And through this tapestry  which is the history of this country  the kids acquire what is probably the most important value in education  and that is the understanding that life is complex  and there's no black and white. And by appreciating complexity  they become more tolerant  and tolerance leads to hope. I ride with these kids once a week  every Tuesday. Here's a picture I took last Tuesday    less than a week ago    and I ride with them tomorrow also. In every one of these rides I always end up standing in one of these incredible locations  taking in this incredible landscape around me  and I feel blessed and fortunate that I'm alive  and that I sense every fiber in my aching body. And I feel blessed and fortunate that    years ago I had the courage to resign my tenured position at NYU and return to my home country where I can do these incredible rides with this group of troubled kids coming from Ethiopia and Morocco and Russia. And I feel blessed and fortunate that every week  every Tuesday    and actually every Friday also    I can once again celebrate in the marrow of my bones the very essence of living in Israel on the edge. Thank you. I grew up in a very small village in Canada  and I'm an undiagnosed dyslexic. I had a really hard time in school. In fact  my mother told me eventually that I was the little kid in the village who cried all the way to school. I ran away. I left when I was    years old to go to Bali  and there I met my incredible wife  Cynthia  and together  over    years  we built an amazing jewelry business. It was a fairy tale  and then we retired. Then she took me to see a film that I really didn't want to see. It ruined my life     The Inconvenient Truth  and Mr. Gore. I have four kids  and even if part of what he says is true  they're not going to have the life that I had. And I decided at that moment that I would spend the rest of my life doing whatever I could to improve their possibilities. So here's the world  and here we are in Bali. It's a tiny  little island       miles by    miles. It has an intact Hindu culture. Cynthia and I were there. We had had a wonderful life there  and we decided to do something unusual. We decided to give back locally. And here it is  it's called the Green School. I know it doesn't look like a school  but it is something we decided to do  and it is extremely  extremely green. The classrooms have no walls. The teacher is writing on a bamboo blackboard. The desks are not square. At Green School  the children are smiling    an unusual thing for school  especially for me. And we practice holism. And for me it's just the idea that  if this little girl graduates as a whole person  chances are she'll demand a whole world    a whole world    to live on. Our children spend     days going to school in a box. The people that built my school also built the prison and the insane asylum out of the same materials. So if this gentleman had had a holistic education  would he be sitting there  Would he have had more possibilities in his life  The classrooms have natural light. They're beautiful. They're bamboo. The breeze passes through them. And when the natural breeze isn't enough  the kids deploy bubbles  but not the kind of bubbles you know. These bubbles are made from natural cotton and rubber from the rubber tree. So we basically turned the box into a bubble. And these kids know that painless climate control may not be part of their future. We pay the bill at the end of the month  but the people that are really going to pay the bill are our grandchildren. We have to teach the kids that the world is not indestructible. These kids did a little graffiti on their desks  and then they signed up for two extra courses. The first one was called sanding and the second one was called re waxing. But since that happened  they own those desks. They know they can control their world. We're on the grid. We're not proud of it. But an amazing alternative energy company in Paris is taking us off the grid with solar. And this thing is the second vortex to be built in the world  in a two and a half meter drop on a river. When the turbine drops in  it will produce       watts of electricity  day and night. And you know what these are. There's nowhere to flush. And as long as we're taking our waste and mixing it with a huge amount of water    you're all really smart  just do the math. How many people times how much water. There isn't enough water. These are compost toilets  and nobody at the school wanted to know about them  especially the principal. And they work. People use them. People are okay. It's something you should think about doing. Not many things didn't work. The beautiful canvas and rubber skylights got eaten by the sun in six months. We had to replace them with recyclable plastic. The teachers dragged giant PVC whiteboards into the classrooms. So we had some good ideas  we took old automobile windshields  put paper behind them and created the first alternative to the whiteboard. Green School sits in south central Bali  and it's on    acres of rolling garden. There's an amazing river traveling through it  and you can see there how we manage to get across the river. I met a father the other day  he looked a little crazed. I said   Welcome to Green School.  He said   I've been on an airplane for    hours.  I asked him   Why   He said   I had a dream once about a green school  and I saw a picture of this green school  I got on an airplane. In August I'm bringing my sons.  This was a great thing. But more than that  people are building green houses around Green School  so their kids can walk to school on the paths. And people are bringing their green industries  hopefully their green restaurants  to the Green School. It's becoming a community. It's becoming a green model. We had to look at everything. No petrochemicals in the pavement. No pavement. These are volcanic stones laid by hand. There are no sidewalks. The sidewalks are gravel. They flood when it rains  but they're green. This is the school buffalo. He's planning to eat that fence for dinner. All the fences at Green School are green. And when the kindergarten kids recently moved their gate  they found out the fence was made out of tapioca. They took the tapioca roots up to the kitchen  sliced them thinly and made delicious chips. Landscaping. We manage to keep the garden that was there running right up to the edge of each of the classrooms. We dropped them gently in. We made space for these guys who are Bali's last black pigs. And the school cow is trying to figure out how to replace the lawnmower on the playing field. These young ladies are living in a rice culture  but they know something that few people know in a rice culture. They know how to plant organic rice  they know how to look after it  they know how to harvest and they know how to cook it. They're part of the rice cycle and these skills will be valuable for them in their future. This young man is picking organic vegetables. We feed     people lunch every day and it's not a normal lunch. There's no gas. Local Balinese women cook the food on sawdust burners using secrets that only their grandmothers know. The food is incredible. Green School is a place of pioneers  local and global. And it's a kind of microcosm of the globalized world. The kids are from    countries. When I see them together  I know that they're working out how to live in the future. Green School is going into its third year with     children. It's a school where you do learn reading    one of my favorites    writing    I was bad at it    arithmetic. But you also learn other things. You learn bamboo building. You practice ancient Balinese arts. This is called mud wrestling in the rice fields. The kids love it. The mothers aren't quite convinced. We've done a lot of outrageous things in our lives  and we said  okay  local  what does  local  mean  Local means that    percent of the population of the school has to be Balinese  and this was a really big commitment. And we were right. And people are coming forward from all over the world to support the Balinese Scholarship Fund  because these kids will be Bali's next green leaders. The teachers are as diverse as the student body  and the amazing thing is that volunteers are popping up. A man came from Java with a new kind of organic agriculture. A woman came from Africa with music. And together these volunteers and the teachers are deeply committed to creating a new generation of global  green leaders. The Green School effect    we don't know what it is. We need someone to come and study it. But what's happening  our learning different kids    dyslexic    we've renamed them prolexic    are doing well in these beautiful  beautiful classrooms. And all the kids are thriving. And how did we do all this  On giant grass. It's bamboo. It comes out of the ground like a train. It grows as high as a coconut tree in two months and three years later it can be harvested to build buildings like this. It's as strong and dense as teak and it will hold up any roof. When the architects came  they brought us these things  and you've probably seen things like this. The yellow box was called the administration complex. We squashed it  we rethought it  but mainly we renamed it  the heart of school   and that changed everything forever. It's a double helix. It has administrators in it and many  many other things. And the problem of building it    when the Balinese workers saw long reams of plans  they looked at them and said   What's this   So we built big models. We had them engineered by the engineers. And Balinese carpenters like this measured them with their bamboo rulers  selected the bamboo and built the buildings using age old techniques  mostly by hand. It was chaos. And the Balinese carpenters want to be as modern as we do  so they use metal scaffolding to build the bamboo building and when the scaffolding came down  we realized that we had a cathedral  a cathedral to green  and a cathedral to green education. The heart of school has seven kilometers of bamboo in it. From the time the foundations were finished  in three months it had roofs and floors. It may not be the biggest bamboo building in the world  but many people believe that it's the most beautiful. Is this doable in your community  We believe it is. Green School is a model we built for the world. It's a model we built for Bali. And you just have to follow these simple  simple rules  be local  let the environment lead and think about how your grandchildren might build. So  Mr. Gore  thank you. You ruined my life  but you gave me an incredible future. And if you're interested in being involved in finishing Green School and building the next    around the world  please come and see us. Thank you. Today I'm going to take you on a voyage to some place so deep  so dark  so unexplored that we know less about it than we know about the dark side of the moon. It's a place of myth and legend. It's a place marked on ancient maps as  here be monsters.  It is a place where each new voyage of exploration brings back new discoveries of creatures so wondrous and strange that our forefathers would have considered them monstrous indeed. Instead  they just make me green with envy that my colleague from IUCN was able to go on this journey to the south of Madagascar seamounts to actually take photographs and to see these wondrous creatures of the deep. We are talking about the high seas. The  high seas  is a legal term  but in fact  it covers    percent of the planet. With an average depth of the oceans of       meters  in fact  the high seas covers and provides nearly    percent of the habitat for life on this Earth. It is  in theory  the global commons  belonging to us all. But in reality  it is managed by and for those who have the resources to go out and exploit it. So today I'm going to take you on a voyage to cast light on some of the outdated myths and legends and assumptions that have kept us as the true stakeholders in the high seas in the dark. We're going to voyage to some of these special places that we've been discovering in the past few years to show why we really need to care. And then finally  we're going to try to develop and pioneer a new perspective on high seas governance that's rooted in ocean basin wide conservation  but framed in an arena of global norms of precaution and respect. So here is a picture of the high seas as seen from above    that area in the darker blue. To me  as an international lawyer  this scared me far more than any of the creatures or the monsters we may have seen  for it belies the notion that you can actually protect the ocean  the global ocean  that provides us all with carbon storage  with heat storage  with oxygen  if you can only protect    percent. This is indeed the true heart of the planet. Some of the problems that we have to confront are that the current international laws    for example  shipping    provide more protection to the areas closest to shore. For example  garbage discharge  something you would think just simply goes away  but the laws regulating ship discharge of garbage actually get weaker the further you are from shore. As a result  we have garbage patches the size of twice Texas. It's unbelievable. We used to think the solution to pollution was dilution  but that has proved to be no longer the case. So what we have learned from social scientists and economists like Elinor Ostrom  who are studying the phenomenon of management of the commons on a local scale  is that there are certain prerequisites that you can put into place that enable you to manage and access open space for the good of one and all. And these include a sense of shared responsibility  common norms that bind people together as a community. Conditional access  You can invite people in  but they have to be able to play by the rules. And of course  if you want people to play by the rules  you still need an effective system of monitoring and enforcement  for as we've discovered  you can trust  but you also need to verify. What I'd also like to convey is that it is not all doom and gloom that we are seeing in the high seas. For a group of very dedicated individuals    scientists  conservationists  photographers and states    were able to actually change a tragic trajectory that was destroying fragile seascapes such as this coral garden that you see in front of you. That is  we're able to save it from a fate of deep sea bottom trawling. And how did we do that  Well  as I said  we had a group of photographers that went out on board ships and actually photographed the activities in process. But we also spent many hours in the basements of the United Nations  trying to work with governments to make them understand what was going on so far away from land that few of us had ever even imagined that these creatures existed. So within three years  from      to       we were able to get norm in place that actually changed the paradigm of how fishers went about deep sea bottom trawling. Instead of  go anywhere  do anything you want   we actually created a regime that required prior assessment of where you're going and a duty to prevent significant harm. In       when the U.N. reviewed progress  they discovered that almost     million square kilometers of seabed had been protected. This does not mean that it's the final solution  or that this even provides permanent protection. But what it does mean is that a group of individuals can form a community to actually shape the way high seas are governed  to create a new regime. So I'm looking optimistically at our opportunities for creating a true  blue perspective for this beautiful planet. Sylvia's wish provides us with that leverage  that access to the heart of human beings  you might say  who have rarely seen places beyond their own toes  but are now hopefully going to become interested in the full life cycle of creatures like these sea turtles  who indeed spend most of their time in the high seas. Today  we're just going to voyage to a small sampling of some of these special areas  just to give you an idea of the flavor of the riches and wonders they do contain. The Sargasso Sea  for example  is not a sea bounded by coastlines  but it is bounded by oceanic currents that contain and envelope this wealth of sargassum that grows and aggregates there. It's also known as the spawning ground for eels from Northern European and Northern American rivers that are now so dwindling in numbers that they've actually stopped showing up in Stockholm  and five showed up in the U.K. just recently. But the Sargasso Sea  the same way it aggregates sargassum weed  actually is pulling in the plastic from throughout the region. This picture doesn't exactly show the plastics that I would like it to show  because I haven't been out there myself. But there has just been a study that was released in February that showed there are         pieces of plastic per square kilometer now floating in the surface of the Sargasso Sea  and that is affecting the habitat for the many species in their juvenile stages who come to the Sargasso Sea for its protection and its food. The Sargasso Sea is also a wondrous place for the aggregation of these unique species that have developed to mimic the sargassum habitat. It also provides a special habitat for these flying fish to lay their eggs. But what I'd like to get from this picture is that we truly do have an opportunity to launch a global initiative for protection. Thus  the government of Bermuda has recognized the need and its responsibility as having some of the Sargasso Sea within its national jurisdiction    but the vast majority is beyond    to help spearhead a movement to achieve protection for this vital area. Spinning down to someplace a little bit cooler than here right now  the Ross Sea in the Southern Ocean. It's actually a bay. It's considered high seas  because the continent has been put off limits to territorial claims. So anything in the water is treated as if it's the high seas. But what makes the Ross Sea important is the vast sea of pack ice that in the spring and summer provides a wealth of phytoplankton and krill that supports what  till recently  has been a virtually intact near shore ecosystem. But unfortunately  CCAMLR  the regional commission in charge of conserving and managing fish stocks and other living marine resources  is unfortunately starting to give in to fishing interests and has authorized the expansion of toothfish fisheries in the region. The captain of a New Zealand vessel who was just down there is reporting a significant decline in the number of the Ross Sea killer whales  who are directly dependent on the Antarctic toothfish as their main source of food. So what we need to do is to stand up boldly  singly and together  to push governments  to push regional fisheries management organizations  to declare our right to declare certain areas off limits to high seas fishing  so that the freedom to fish no longer means the freedom to fish anywhere and anytime. Coming closer to here  the Costa Rica Dome is a recently discovered area    potentially year round habitat for blue whales. There's enough food there to last them the summer and the winter long. But what's unusual about the Costa Rica Dome is  in fact  it's not a permanent place. It's an oceanographic phenomenon that shifts in time and space on a seasonal basis. So  in fact  it's not permanently in the high seas. It's not permanently in the exclusive economic zones of these five Central American countries  but it moves with the season. As such  it does create a challenge to protect  but we also have a challenge protecting the species that move along with it. We can use the same technologies that fishers use to identify where the species are  in order to close the area when it's most vulnerable  which may  in some cases  be year round. Getting closer to shore  where we are  this was in fact taken in the Galapagos. Many species are headed through this region  which is why there's been so much attention put into conservation of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape. This is the initiative that's been coordinated by Conservation International with a variety of partners and governments to actually try to bring integrated management regime throughout the area. That is  it provides a wonderful example of where you can go with a real regional initiative. It's protecting five World Heritage sites. Unfortunately  the World Heritage Convention does not recognize the need to protect areas beyond national jurisdiction  at present. So a place like the Costa Rica Dome could not technically qualify the time it's in the high seas. So what we've been suggesting is that we either need to amend the World Heritage Convention  so that it can adopt and urge universal protection of these World Heritage sites  or we need to change the name and call it Half the World Heritage Convention. But what we also know is that species like these sea turtles do not stay put in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape. These happen to go down to a vast South Pacific Gyre  where they spend most of their time and often end up getting hooked like this  or as bycatch. So what I'd really like to suggest is that we need to scale up. We need to work locally  but we also need to work ocean basin wide. We have the tools and technologies now to enable us to take a broader ocean basin wide initiative. We've heard about the Tagging of Pacific Predators project  one of the    Census of Marine Life projects. It's provided us data like this  of tiny  little sooty shearwaters that make the entire ocean basin their home. They fly        kilometers in less than a year. So we have the tools and treasures coming from the Census of Marine Life. And its culminating year that's going to be launched in October. So stay tuned for further information. What I find so exciting is that the Census of Marine Life has looked at more than the tagging of pacific predators  it's also looked in the really unexplored mid water column  where creatures like this flying sea cucumber have been found. And fortunately  we've been able  as IUCN  to team up with the Census of Marine Life and many of the scientists working there to actually try to translate much of this information to policymakers. We have the support of governments now behind us. We've been revealing this information through technical workshops. And the exciting thing is that we do have sufficient information to move ahead to protect some of these significant hope spots  hotspots. At the same time we're saying   Yes  we need more. We need to move forward.  But many of you have said  if you get these marine protected areas  or a reasonable regime for high seas fisheries management in place  how are you going to enforce it  Which leads me to my second passion besides ocean science  which is outer space technology. I wanted to be an astronaut  so I've constantly followed what are the tools available to monitor Earth from outer space    and that we have incredible tools like we've been learning about  in terms of being able to follow tagged species throughout their life cycles in the open ocean. We can also tag and track fishing vessels. Many already have transponders on board that allow us to find out where they are and even what they're doing. But not all the vessels have those to date. It does not take too much rocket science to actually try to create new laws to mandate  if you're going to have the privilege of accessing our high seas resources  we need to know    someone needs to know    where you are and what you're doing. So it brings me to my main take home message  which is we can avert a tragedy of the commons. We can stop the collision course of    percent of the planet with the high seas. But we need to think broad scale. We need to think globally. We need to change how we actually go about managing these resources. We need to get the new paradigm of precaution and respect. At the same time  we need to think locally  which is the joy and marvel of Sylvia's hope spot wish  is that we can shine a spotlight on many of these previously unknown areas  and to bring people to the table  if you will  to actually make them feel part of this community that truly has a stake in their future management. And third is that we need to look at ocean basin wide management. Our species are ocean basin wide. Many of the deep sea communities have genetic distribution that goes ocean basin wide. We need to better understand  but we also need to start to manage and protect. And in order to do that  you also need ocean basin management regimes. That is  we have regional management regimes within the exclusive economic zone  but we need to scale these up  we need to build their capacity  so they're like the Southern Ocean  where they do have the two pronged fisheries and conservation organization. So with that  I would just like to sincerely thank and honor Sylvia Earle for her wish  for it is helping us to put a face on the high seas and the deep seas beyond national jurisdiction. It's helping to bring an incredible group of talented people together to really try to solve and penetrate these problems that have created our obstacles to management and rational use of this area that was once so far away and remote. So on this tour  I hope I provided you with a new perspective of the high seas  one  that it is our home too  and that we need to work together if we are to make this a sustainable ocean future for us all. Thank you. So  a funny thing happened on my way to becoming a brilliant  world class neuropsychologist  I had a baby. And that's not to say I ever went on to become a brilliant  world class neuropsychologist. Sorry  TED. But I did go on to be a reasonably astute  arguably world class worrier. One of my girlfriends in graduate school  Marie  said   Kim  I figured it out. It's not that you're more neurotic than everyone else  it's just that you're more honest about how neurotic you are.  So in the spirit of full disclosure  I brought some pictures to share. Awwww. I'll just say  July. Zzzzzzip for safety. Water wings    an inch of water. And then  finally  all suited up for the    minute drive to Copper Mountain. So you can get kind of a feel for this. So my baby  Vander  is eight years old now. And  despite being cursed with my athletic inability  he plays soccer. He's interested in playing football. He wants to learn how to ride a unicycle. So why would I worry  Because this is what I do. This is what I teach. It's what I study. It's what I treat. And I know that kids get concussed every year. In fact  more than four million people sustain a concussion every year  and these data are just among kids under    who were seen in emergency rooms. And so when kids sustain a concussion  we talk about them getting dinged or getting their bell rung  but what is it that we're really talking about  Let's take a look. All right.  Starsky and Hutch   arguably  yes. So a car accident. Forty miles an hour into a fixed barrier       Gs. A heavy weight boxer punches you straight in the face       Gs. In case you missed it  we'll look again. So look to the right hand side of the screen. What would you say  How many Gs  Close. Seventy two. Would it be crazy to know      Gs. The average concussive impact is    Gs. Now  when the kid on the right doesn't get up  we know they've had a concussion. But how about the kid on the left  or the athlete that leaves the field of play  How do we know if he or she has sustained a concussion  How do we know that legislation that would require that they be pulled from play  cleared for return to play  applies to them  The definition of concussion doesn't actually require a loss of consciousness. It requires only a change in consciousness  and that can be any one of a number of symptoms  including feeling foggy  feeling dizzy  hearing a ringing in your ear  being more impulsive or hostile than usual. So given all of that and given how darn neurotic I am  how do I get any sleep at all  Because I know our brains are resilient. They're designed to recover from an injury. If  God forbid  any of us left here tonight and sustained a concussion  most of us would go on to fully recover inside of a couple hours to a couple of weeks. But kids are more vulnerable to brain injury. In fact  high school athletes are three times more likely to sustain catastrophic injuries relative even to their college age peers  and it takes them longer to return to a symptom free baseline. After that first injury  their risk for second injury is exponentially greater. From there  their risk for a third injury  greater still  and so on. And here's the really alarming part  we don't fully understand the long term impact of multiple injuries. You guys may be familiar with this research that's coming out of the NFL. In a nutshell  this research suggests that among retired NFL players with three or more career concussions  the incidents of early onset dementing disease is much greater than it is for the general population. So you've all seen that    New York Times  you've seen it. What you may not be familiar with is that this research was spearheaded by NFL wives who said   Isn't it weird that my    year old husband is forever losing his keys  Isn't it weird that my    year old husband is forever losing the car  Isn't it weird that my    year old husband is forever losing his way home in the car  from the driveway   So I may have forgotten to mention that my son is an only child. So it's going to be really important that he be able to drive me around some day. So how do we guarantee the safety of our kids  How can we     percent guarantee the safety of our kids  Let me tell you what I've come up with. If only. My little boy's right there  and he's like   She's not kidding. She's totally not kidding.  So in all seriousness  should my kid play football  Should your kid play football  I don't know. But I do know there are three things you can do. The first  study up. You have to be familiar with the issues we're talking about today. There are some great resources out there. The CDC has a program  Heads Up. It's at CDC.gov. Heads Up is specific to concussion in kids. The second is a resource I'm personally really proud of. We've just rolled this out in the last couple months    CO Kids With Brain Injury. This is a great resource for student athletes  teachers  parents  professionals  athletic and coaching staff. It's a great place to start if you have questions. The second thing is  speak up. Just two weeks ago  a bill introduced by Senator Kefalas that would have required athletes  kids under     to wear a helmet when they're riding their bike died in committee. It died in large part because it lacked constituent buy in  it lacked stakeholder traction. Now I'm not here to tell you what kind of legislation you should or shouldn't support  but I am going to tell you that  if it matters to you  your legislators need to know that. Speak up also with coaching staff. Ask about what kind of protective equipment is available. What's the budget for protective equipment  How old it is  Maybe offer to spearhead a fundraiser to buy new gear    which brings us to suit up. Wear a helmet. The only way to prevent a bad outcome is to prevent that first injury from happening. Recently  one of my graduate students  Tom said   Kim  I've decided to wear a bike helmet on my way to class.  And Tom knows that that little bit of foam in a bike helmet can reduce the G force of impact by half. Now I thought that it was because I have this totally compelling helmet crusade  right  this epiphany of Tom's. As it turns out  it occurred to Tom that a     helmet is a good way to protect a          graduate education. So  should Vander play football  I can't say no  but I can guarantee that every time he leaves the house that kid's wearing a helmet    like to the car  or at school. So whether athlete  scholar  over protected kid  neurotic mom  or otherwise  here's my baby  Vander  reminding you to mind your matter. Thank you. I woke up in the middle of the night with the sound of heavy explosion. It was deep at night. I do not remember what time it was. I just remember the sound was so heavy and so very shocking. Everything in my room was shaking    my heart  my windows  my bed  everything. I looked out the windows and I saw a full half circle of explosion. I thought it was just like the movies  but the movies had not conveyed them in the powerful image that I was seeing full of bright red and orange and gray  and a full circle of explosion. And I kept on staring at it until it disappeared. I went back to my bed  and I prayed  and I secretly thanked God that that missile did not land on my family's home  that it did not kill my family that night. Thirty years have passed  and I still feel guilty about that prayer  for the next day  I learned that that missile landed on my brother's friend's home and killed him and his father  but did not kill his mother or his sister. His mother showed up the next week at my brother's classroom and begged seven year old kids to share with her any picture they may have of her son  for she had lost everything. This is not a story of a nameless survivor of war  and nameless refugees  whose stereotypical images we see in our newspapers and our TV with tattered clothes  dirty face  scared eyes. This is not a story of a nameless someone who lived in some war  who we do not know their hopes  their dreams  their accomplishments  their families  their beliefs  their values. This is my story. I was that girl. I am another image and vision of another survivor of war. I am that refugee  and I am that girl. You see  I grew up in war torn Iraq  and I believe that there are two sides of wars and we've only seen one side of it. We only talk about one side of it. But there's another side that I have witnessed as someone who lived in it and someone who ended up working in it. I grew up with the colors of war    the red colors of fire and blood  the brown tones of earth as it explodes in our faces and the piercing silver of an exploded missile  so bright that nothing can protect your eyes from it. I grew up with the sounds of war    the staccato sounds of gunfire  the wrenching booms of explosions  ominous drones of jets flying overhead and the wailing warning sounds of sirens. These are the sounds you would expect  but they are also the sounds of dissonant concerts of a flock of birds screeching in the night  the high pitched honest cries of children and the thunderous  unbearable silence.  War   a friend of mine said   is not about sound at all. It is actually about silence  the silence of humanity.  I have since left Iraq and founded a group called Women for Women International that ends up working with women survivors of wars. In my travels and in my work  from Congo to Afghanistan  from Sudan to Rwanda  I have learned not only that the colors and the sounds of war are the same  but the fears of war are the same. You know  there is a fear of dying  and do not believe any movie character where the hero is not afraid. It is very scary to go through that feeling of  I am about to die  or  I could die in this explosion.  But there's also the fear of losing loved ones  and I think that's even worse. It's too painful. You don't want to think about it. But I think the worst kind of fear is the fear    as Samia  a Bosnian woman  once told me  who survived the four years besiege of Sarajevo  she said   The fear of losing the 'I' in me  the fear of losing the 'I' in me.  That's what my mother in Iraq used to tell me. It's like dying from inside out. A Palestinian woman once told me   It is not about the fear of one death   she said   sometimes I feel I die    times in one day   as she was describing the marches of soldiers and the sounds of their bullets. She said   But it's not fair  because there is only one life  and there should only be one death.  We have been only seeing one side of war. We have only been discussing and consumed with high level preoccupations over troop levels  drawdown timelines  surges and sting operations  when we should be examining the details of where the social fabric has been most torn  where the community has improvised and survived and shown acts of resilience and amazing courage just to keep life going. We have been so consumed with seemingly objective discussions of politics  tactics  weapons  dollars and casualties. This is the language of sterility. How casually we treat casualties in the context of this topic. This is where we conceive of rape and casualties as inevitabilities. Eighty percent of refugees around the world are women and children. Oh. Ninety percent of modern war casualties are civilians. Seventy five percent of them are women and children. How interesting. Oh  half a million women in Rwanda get raped in     days. Or  as we speak now  hundreds of thousands of Congolese women are getting raped and mutilated. How interesting. These just become numbers that we refer to. The front of wars is increasingly non human eyes peering down on our perceived enemies from space  guiding missiles toward unseen targets  while the human conduct of the orchestra of media relations in the event that this particular drone attack hits a villager instead of an extremist. It is a chess game. You learn to play an international relations school on your way out and up to national and international leadership. Checkmate. We are missing a completely other side of wars. We are missing my mother's story  who made sure with every siren  with every raid  with every cut off of electricity  she played puppet shows for my brothers and I  so we would not be scared of the sounds of explosions. We are missing the story of Fareeda  a music teacher  a piano teacher  in Sarajevo  who made sure that she kept the music school open every single day in the four years of besiege in Sarajevo and walked to that school  despite the snipers shooting at that school and at her  and kept the piano  the violin  the cello playing the whole duration of the war  with students wearing their gloves and hats and coats. That was her fight. That was her resistance. We are missing the story of Nehia  a Palestinian woman in Gaza who  the minute there was a cease fire in the last year's war  she left out of home  collected all the flour and baked as much bread for every neighbor to have  in case there is no cease fire the day after. We are missing the stories of Violet  who  despite surviving genocide in the church massacre  she kept on going on  burying bodies  cleaning homes  cleaning the streets. We are missing stories of women who are literally keeping life going in the midst of wars. Do you know    do you know that people fall in love in war and go to school and go to factories and hospitals and get divorced and go dancing and go playing and live life going  And the ones who are keeping that life are women. There are two sides of war. There is a side that fights  and there is a side that keeps the schools and the factories and the hospitals open. There is a side that is focused on winning battles  and there is a side that is focused on winning life. There is a side that leads the front line discussion  and there is a side that leads the back line discussion. There is a side that thinks that peace is the end of fighting  and there is a side that thinks that peace is the arrival of schools and jobs. There is a side that is led by men  and there is a side that is led by women. And in order for us to understand how do we build lasting peace  we must understand war and peace from both sides. We must have a full picture of what that means. In order for us to understand what actually peace means  we need to understand  as one Sudanese woman once told me   Peace is the fact that my toenails are growing back again.  She grew up in Sudan  in Southern Sudan  for    years of war  where it killed one million people and displaced five million refugees. Many women were taken as slaves by rebels and soldiers  as sexual slaves who were forced also to carry the ammunition and the water and the food for the soldiers. So that woman walked for    years  so she would not be kidnapped again. And only when there was some sort of peace  her toenails grew back again. We need to understand peace from a toenail's perspective. We need to understand that we cannot actually have negotiations of ending of wars or peace without fully including women at the negotiating table. I find it amazing that the only group of people who are not fighting and not killing and not pillaging and not burning and not raping  and the group of people who are mostly    though not exclusively    who are keeping life going in the midst of war  are not included in the negotiating table. And I do argue that women lead the back line discussion  but there are also men who are excluded from that discussion. The doctors who are not fighting  the artists  the students  the men who refuse to pick up the guns  they are  too  excluded from the negotiating tables. There is no way we can talk about a lasting peace  building of democracy  sustainable economies  any kind of stabilities  if we do not fully include women at the negotiating table. Not one  but    percent. There is no way we can talk about the building of stability if we don't start investing in women and girls. Did you know that one year of the world's military spending equals     years of the U.N. budget and equals       years of the U.N. budget allocated for women  If we just reverse that distribution of funds  perhaps we could have a better lasting peace in this world. And last  but not least  we need to invest in peace and women  not only because it is the right thing to do  not only because it is the right thing to do  for all of us to build sustainable and lasting peace today  but it is for the future. A Congolese woman  who was telling me about how her children saw their father killed in front of them and saw her raped in front of them and mutilated in front of them  and her children saw their nine year old sibling killed in front of them  how they're doing okay right now. She got into Women for Women International's program. She got a support network. She learned about her rights. We taught her vocational and business skills. We helped her get a job. She was earning     dollars. She was doing okay. She was sending them to school. Have a new home. She said   But what I worry about the most is not any of that. I worry that my children have hate in their hearts  and when they want to grow up  they want to fight again the killers of their father and their brother.  We need to invest in women  because that's our only chance to ensure that there is no more war in the future. That mother has a better chance to heal her children than any peace agreement can do. Are there good news  Of course  there are good news. There are lots of good news. To start with  these women that I told you about are dancing and singing every single day  and if they can  who are we not to dance  That girl that I told you about ended up starting Women for Women International Group that impacted one million people  sent    million dollars  and I started this from zero  nothing  nada   unclear . They are women who are standing on their feet in spite of their circumstances  not because of it. Think of how the world can be a much better place if  for a change  we have a better equality  we have equality  we have a representation and we understand war  both from the front line and the back line discussion. Rumi  a   th century Sufi poet  says   Out beyond the worlds of right doings and wrong doings  there is a field. I will meet you there. When the soul lies down in that grass  the world is too full to talk about. Ideas  language  even the phrase 'each other' no longer makes any sense.  I humbly add    humbly add    that out beyond the worlds of war and peace  there is a field  and there are many women and men  who  are meeting there. Let us make this field a much bigger place. Let us all meet in that field. Thank you. So I'm going to talk about work  specifically  why people can't seem to get work done at work  which is a problem we all kind of have. But let's sort of start at the beginning. So  we have companies and non profits and charities and all these groups that have employees or volunteers of some sort. And they expect these people who work for them to do great work    I would hope  at least. At least good work  hopefully  at least it's good work    hopefully great work. And so what they typically do is they decide that all these people need to come together in one place to do that work. So a company  or a charity  or an organization of any kind  unless you're working in Africa  if you're really lucky to do that    most people have to go to an office every day. And so these companies  they build offices. They go out and they buy a building  or they rent a building  or they lease some space  and they fill this space with stuff. They fill it with tables  or desks  chairs  computer equipment  software  Internet access  maybe a fridge  maybe a few other things  and they expect their employees  or their volunteers  to come to that location every day to do great work. It seems like it's perfectly reasonable to ask that. However  if you actually talk to people and even question yourself  and you ask yourself  where do you really want to go when you really need to get something done  You'll find out that people don't say what businesses think they would say. If you ask people the question  Where do you need to go when you need to get something done  Typically  you get three different kinds of answers. One is kind of a place or a location or a room. Another one is a moving object  and a third is a time. So here are some examples. I've been asking people this question for about    years   Where do you go when you really need to get something done   I'll hear things like  the porch  the deck  the kitchen. I'll hear things like an extra room in the house  the basement  the coffee shop  the library. And then you'll hear things like the train  a plane  a car    so  the commute. And then you'll hear people say   Well  it doesn't really matter where I am  as long as it's early in the morning or late at night or on the weekends.  You almost never hear someone say   The office.  But businesses are spending all this money on this place called the office  and they're making people go to it all the time  yet people don't do work in the office. What is that about  Why is that  Why is that happening  And what you find out is  if you dig a little bit deeper  you find out that people    this is what happens  People go to work  and they're basically trading in their work day for a series of  work moments     that's what happens at the office. You don't have a work day anymore. You have work moments. It's like the front door of the office is like a Cuisinart  and you walk in and your day is shredded to bits  because you have    minutes here     minutes there  and something else happens  you're pulled off your work  then you have    minutes  then it's lunch  then you have something else to do ... Then you've got    minutes  and someone pulls you aside and asks you a question  and before you know it  it's   p.m.  and you look back on the day  and you realize that you didn't get anything done. We've all been through this. We probably went through it yesterday or the day before  or the day before that. You look back on your day  and you're like   I got nothing done today. I was at work. I sat at my desk. I used my expensive computer. I used the software they told me to use. I went to these meetings I was asked to go to. I did these conference calls. I did all this stuff. But I didn't actually do anything. I just did tasks. I didn't actually get meaningful work done.  And what you find is that  especially with creative people    designers  programmers  writers  engineers  thinkers    that people really need long stretches of uninterrupted time to get something done. You cannot ask somebody to be creative in    minutes and really think about a problem. You might have a quick idea  but to be in deep thought about a problem and really consider a problem carefully  you need long stretches of uninterrupted time. And even though the work day is typically eight hours  how many people here have ever had eight hours to themselves at the office  How about seven hours  Six  Five  Four  When's the last time you had three hours to yourself at the office  Two hours  One  maybe  Very  very few people actually have long stretches of uninterrupted time at an office. And this is why people choose to do work at home  or they might go to the office  but they might go to the office really early in the day  or late at night when no one's around  or they stick around after everyone's left  or go in on the weekends  or they get work done on the plane  in the car or in the train  because there are no distractions. Now there are different kinds of distractions  but not the really bad distractions  which I'll talk about in a minute. And this whole phenomenon of having short bursts of time to get things done reminds me of another thing that doesn't work when you're interrupted  and that is sleep. I think that sleep and work are very closely related    not because you can work while you're sleeping and sleep while you're working. That's not really what I mean. I'm talking specifically about the fact that sleep and work are phase based  or stage based  events. Sleep is about sleep phases  or stages    some people call them different things. There are five of them  and in order to get to the really deep ones  the meaningful ones  you have to go through the early ones. If you're interrupted while you're going through the early ones    if someone bumps you in bed  or there's a sound  or whatever happens    you don't just pick up where you left off. If you're interrupted and woken up  you have to start again. So you have to go back a few phases and start again. And what ends up happening    you might have days like this where you wake up at eight or seven in the morning  or whenever you get up  and you're like   I didn't sleep very well. I did the sleep thing    I went to bed  I laid down  but I didn't really sleep.  People say you go  to  sleep  but you don't go to sleep  you go towards sleep  it takes a while. You've got to go through phases and stuff  and if you're interrupted  you don't sleep well. So does anyone here expect someone to sleep well if they're interrupted all night  I don't think anyone would say yes. Why do we expect people to work well if they're being interrupted all day at the office  How can we possibly expect people to do their job if they go to the office and are interrupted  That doesn't really seem like it makes a lot of sense  to me. So what are the interruptions that happen at the office but not at other places  Because in other places  you can have interruptions like the TV  or you could go for a walk  or there's a fridge downstairs  or you've got your own couch  or whatever you want to do. If you talk to certain managers  they'll tell you that they don't want their employees to work at home because of these distractions. They'll sometimes also say   If I can't see the person  how do I know they're working   which is ridiculous  but that's one of the excuses that managers give. And I'm one of these managers. I understand. I know how this goes. We all have to improve on this sort of thing. But oftentimes they'll cite distractions   I can't let someone work at home. They'll watch TV  or do this other thing.  It turns out those aren't the things that are distracting  Because those are voluntary distractions. You decide when you want to be distracted by the TV  when you want to turn something on  or when you want to go downstairs or go for a walk. At the office  most of the interruptions and distractions that really cause people not to get work done are involuntary. So let's go through a couple of those. Now  managers and bosses will often have you think that the real distractions at work are things like Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and other websites  and in fact  they'll go so far as to actually ban these sites at work. Some of you may work at places where you can't get to certain sites. I mean  is this China  What the hell is going on here  You can't go to a website at work  and that's the problem  That's why people aren't getting work done  because they're on Facebook and Twitter  That's kind of ridiculous. It's a total decoy. Today's Facebook and Twitter and YouTube  these things are just modern day smoke breaks. No one cared about letting people take a smoke break for    minutes    years ago  so why does anyone care if someone goes to Facebook or Twitter or YouTube here and there  Those aren't the real problems in the office. The real problems are what I like to call the M Ms  the Managers and the Meetings. Those are the real problems in the modern office today. And this is why things don't get done at work  it's because of the M Ms. Now what's interesting is  if you listen to all the places that people talk about doing work  like at home  in the car  on a plane  late at night  or early in the morning  you don't find managers and meetings. You find a lot of other distractions  but not managers and meetings. So these are the things that you don't find elsewhere  but you do find at the office. And managers are basically people whose job it is to interrupt people. That's pretty much what managers are for. They're for interrupting people. They don't really do the work  so they make sure everyone else is doing work  which is an interruption. We have lots of managers in the world now  and a lot of people in the world  and a lot of interruptions by these managers. They have to check in   Hey  how's it going  Show me what's up.  This sort of thing. They keep interrupting you at the wrong time  while you're actually trying to do something they're paying you to do  they tend to interrupt you. That's kind of bad. But what's even worse is the thing that managers do most of all  which is call meetings. And meetings are just toxic  terrible  poisonous things during the day at work. We all know this to be true  and you would never see a spontaneous meeting called by employees. It doesn't work that way. The manager calls the meeting so the employees can all come together  and it's an incredibly disruptive thing to do to people    to say   Hey look  we're going to bring    people together right now and have a meeting. I don't care what you're doing  you've got to stop doing it  so you can have this meeting.  I mean  what are the chances that all    people are ready to stop  What if they're thinking about something important  or doing important work  All of a sudden you tell them they have to stop doing that to do something else. So they go into a meeting room  they get together  and they talk about stuff that doesn't really matter  usually. Because meetings aren't work. Meetings are places to go to talk about things you're supposed to be doing later. But meetings also procreate. So one meeting tends to lead to another meeting  which leads to another meeting. There's often too many people in the meetings  and they're very  very expensive to the organization. Companies often think of a one hour meeting as a one hour meeting  but that's not true  unless there's only one person. If there are    people  it's a    hour meeting  not a one hour meeting. It's    hours of productivity taken from the rest of the organization to have this one hour meeting  which probably should have been handled by two or three people talking for a few minutes. But instead  there's a long scheduled meeting  because meetings are scheduled the way software works  which is in increments of    minutes  or    minutes  or an hour. You don't schedule an eight hour meeting with Outlook  you can't. You can go    minutes or    minutes or    minutes or an hour. And so we tend to fill these times up when things should go really quickly. So meetings and managers are two major problems in businesses today  especially at offices. These things don't exist outside of the office. So I have some suggestions to remedy the situation. What can managers do    enlightened managers  hopefully    what can they do to make the office a better place for people to work  so it's not the last resort  but it's the first resort  so that people start to say   When I really want to get stuff done  I go to the office.  Because the offices are well equipped  everything is there for them to do the work. But they don't want to go there right now  so how do we change that  I have three suggestions to share with you. I have about three minutes  so that'll fit perfectly. We've all heard of the Casual Friday thing. I don't know if people still do that. But how about  No talk Thursdays   Pick one Thursday once a month  and cut it in half  just the afternoon    I'll make it easy for you. So just the afternoon  one Thursday. First Thursday of the month  just the afternoon  nobody in the office can talk to each other. Just silence  that's it. And what you'll find is that a tremendous amount of work gets done when no one talks to each other. This is when people actually get stuff done  is when no one's bothering them or interrupting them. Giving someone four hours of uninterrupted time is the best gift you can give anybody at work. It's better than a computer  better than a new monitor  better than new software  or whatever people typically use. Giving them four hours of quiet time at the office is going to be incredibly valuable. If you try that  I think you'll agree  and hopefully you can do it more often. So maybe it's every other week  or every week  once a week  afternoons no one can talk to each other. That's something that you'll find will really  really work. Another thing you can try  is switching from active communication and collaboration  which is like face to face stuff    tapping people on the shoulder  saying hi to them  having meetings  and replace that with more passive models of communication  using things like email and instant messaging  or collaboration products  things like that. Now some people might say email is really distracting  I.M. is really distracting  and these other things are really distracting  but they're distracting at a time of your own choice and your own choosing. You can quit the email app  you can't quit your boss. You can quit I.M.  you can't hide your manager. You can put these things away  and then you can be interrupted on your own schedule  at your own time  when you're available  when you're ready to go again. Because work  like sleep  happens in phases. So you'll be going up  doing some work  and then you'll come down from that work  and then maybe it's time to check that email or I.M. There are very  very few things that are that urgent  that need to happen  that need to be answered right this second. So if you're a manager  start encouraging people to use more things like I.M. and email and other things that someone can put away and then get back to you on their own schedule. And the last suggestion I have is that  if you do have a meeting coming up  if you have the power  just cancel it. Just cancel that next meeting. Today's Friday  usually people have meetings on Monday. Just don't have it. I don't mean move it  I mean just erase it from memory  it's gone. And you'll find out that everything will be just fine. All these discussions and decisions you thought you had to make at this one time at   a.m. on Monday  just forget about them  and things will be fine. People will have a more open morning  they can actually think. You'll find out all these things you thought you had to do  you don't actually have to do. So those are just three quick suggestions I wanted to give you guys to think about. I hope that some of these ideas were at least provocative enough for managers and bosses and business owners and organizers and people who are in charge of other people  to think about laying off a little bit  and giving people more time to get work done. I think it'll all pay off in the end. So  thanks for listening. Thank you very much. I have a few pictures  and I'll talk a little bit about how I'm able to do what I do. All these houses are built from between    and    percent recycled material  stuff that was headed to the mulcher  the landfill  the burn pile. It was all just gone. This is the first house I built. This double front door here with the three light transom that was headed to the landfill. Have a little turret there. And then these buttons on the corbels here. Right there    those are hickory nuts. And these buttons there    those are chicken eggs. Of course  first you have breakfast  and then you fill the shell full of Bondo and paint it and nail it up  and you have an architectural button in just a fraction of the time. Then  this is a look at the inside. You can see the three light transom there with the eyebrow windows    certainly an architectural antique headed to the landfill. Even the lockset is probably worth     dollars. Everything in the kitchen was salvaged. There's a      O'Keefe   Merritt stove  if you like to cook    cool stove. This is going up into the turret. I got that staircase for    dollars  including delivery to my lot. Then  looking up in the turret  you see there are bulges and pokes and sags and so forth. Well  if that ruins your life  well then you shouldn't live there. This is a laundry chute  and this right here is a shoe last. And those are those cast iron things you see at antique shops. So I had one of those  so I made some low tech gadgetry  there  where you just stomp on the shoe last and then the door flies open  you throw your laundry down. And then if you're smart enough  it goes on a basket on top of the washer. If not  it goes into the toilet. This is a bathtub I made  made out of scrap two by four here. Started with a rim there and then glued and nailed it up into a flat  corbelled it up and flipped it over  then did the two profiles on this side. It's a two person tub. After all  it's not just a question of hygiene  but there's a possibility of recreation as well. Then  this faucet here is just a piece of Osage Orange. It looks a little phallic  but after all  it's a bathroom. Then  this is a house based on a Budweiser can. It doesn't look like a can of beer  but the design take offs are absolutely unmistakable. The barley hops design worked up into the eaves  then the dentil work comes directly off the can's red  white  blue and silver. Then  these corbeles going down underneath the eaves are that little design that comes off the can. I just put a can on a copier and kept enlarging it until I got the size I want. Then  on the can it says   This is the famous Budweiser beer  we know of no other beer  blah  blah  blah.  So we changed that and put   This is the famous Budweiser house. We don't know of any other house   and so forth and so on. Then  this is a deadbolt. It's a fence from a     s shaper  which is a very angry woodworking machine. And they gave me the fence  but they didn't give me the shaper  so we made a deadbolt out of it. That'll keep bull elephants out  I promise. And sure enough  we've had no problems with bull elephants. The shower is intended to simulate a glass of beer. We've got bubbles going up there  then suds at the top with lumpy tiles. Where do you get lumpy tiles  Well  of course  you don't. But I get a lot of toilets  and so you just dispatch a toilet with a hammer  and then you have lumpy tiles. And then the faucet  there  is a beer tap. Then  this panel of glass is the same panel of glass that occurs in every middle class front door in America. We're getting tired of it. It's kind of cliched now. So if you put it in the front door  your design fails. So don't put it in the front door  put it somewhere else. It's a pretty panel of glass. But then if you put it in the front door  people say   Oh  you're trying to be like those guys  and you didn't make it.  So don't put it there. Then  another bathroom upstairs. This light up here is the same light that occurs in every middle class foyer in America. Don't put it in the foyer. Put it in the shower  or in the closet  but not in the foyer. Then  somebody gave me a bidet  so it got a bidet. This little house here  those branches there are made out of Bois D'arc or Osage Orange  and these pictures will keep scrolling as I talk a little bit. In order to do what I do  you have to understand what causes waste in the building industry. Our housing has become a commodity  and I'll talk a little bit about that. But the first cause of waste is probably even buried in our DNA. Human beings have a need for maintaining consistency of the apperceptive mass. What does that mean  What it means is  for every perception we have  it needs to tally with the one like it before  or we don't have continuity  and we become a little bit disoriented. So I can show you an object you've never seen before. Oh  that's a cell phone. But you've never seen this one before. What you're doing is sizing up the pattern of structural features here  and then you go through your databanks    brrrr  cell phone. Oh  that's a cell phone. If I took a bite out of it  you'd go   Wait a second. That's not a cell phone. That's one of those new chocolate cell phones.  And you'd have to start a new category  right between cell phones and chocolate. That's how we process information. So you translate that to the building industry  if we have a wall of windowpanes and one pane is cracked  we go   Oh  dear. That's cracked. Let's repair it. Let's take it out. Throw it away so nobody can use it and put a new one in.  Because that's what you do with a cracked pane. Never mind that it doesn't affect our lives at all. It only rattles that expected pattern and unity of structural features. However  if we took a small hammer  and we added cracks to all the other windows  then we have a pattern. Because Gestalt Psychology emphasizes recognition of pattern over parts that comprise a pattern. We'll go   Ooh  that's nice.  So  that serves me every day. Repetition creates pattern. If I have a hundred of these  a hundred of those  it doesn't make any difference what these and those are. If I can repeat anything  I have the possibility of a pattern from hickory nuts and chicken eggs  shards of glass  branches. It doesn't make any difference. That causes a lot of waste in the building industry. Second is  Friedrich Nietzsche along about      wrote a book titled  The Birth of Tragedy.  And in there he said that cultures tend to swing between one of two perspectives. On the one hand  we have an Apollonian perspective  which is very crisp and premeditated and intellectualized and perfect. On the other end of the spectrum  we have a Dionysian perspective  which is more given to the passions and intuition  tolerant of organic texture and human gesture. So the way the Apollonian personality takes a picture  or hangs a picture  is they'll get out a transit and a laser level and a micrometer.  Okay  honey. A thousandth of an inch to the left. That's where we want the picture. Right. Perfect.  Predicated on plumb level  square and centered. The Dionysian personality takes the picture and goes ... That's the difference. I feature blemish. I feature organic process. Dead center John Dewey. Apollonian mindset creates mountains of waste. If something isn't perfect  if it doesn't line up with that premeditated model  dumpster.  Oops  scratch  dumpster.   Oops  this   oops  that.  Landfill. Landfill. Landfill.  The third thing is arguably    the Industrial Revolution started in the Renaissance with the rise of humanism  then got a little jump start along about the French Revolution. By the middle of the   th century  it's in full flower. And we have dumaflages and gizmos and contraptions that will do anything that we  up to that point  had to do my hand. So now we have standardized materials. Well  trees don't grow two inches by four inches  eight  ten and twelve feet tall. We create mountains of waste. And they're doing a pretty good job there in the forest  working all the byproduct of their industry    with OSB and particle board and so forth and so on    but it does no good to be responsible at the point of harvest in the forest if consumers are wasting the harvest at the point of consumption  and that's what's happening. And so if something isn't standard   Oops  dumpster.   Oops  this.  Oops  warped.  If you buy a two by four and it's not straight  you can take it back.  Oh  I'm so sorry  sir. We'll get you a straight one.  Well I feature all those warped things because repetition creates pattern  and it's from a Dionysian perspective. The fourth thing is labor is disproportionately more expensive than materials. Well  that's just a myth. And here's a story  Jim Tulles  one of the guys I trained  I said   Jim  it's time now. I got a job for you as a foreman on a framing crew. It's time for you to go.   Dan  I just don't think I'm ready.   Jim  now it's time. You're the down  oh.  So we hired on. And he was out there with his tape measure going through the trash heap  looking for header material  which is the board that goes over a door  thinking he'd impress his boss    that's how we taught him to do it. And the superintendent walked up and said   What are you doing    Oh  just looking for some header material   waiting for that kudos. He said   No  no. I'm not paying you to go through the trash. Get back to work.  And he had the wherewithal to say  he said   You know  if you were paying me     dollars an hour  I can see how you might say that  but right now  I'm saving you five dollars a minute. Do the math.   Good call  Tulles. From now on  you guys hit this pile first.  And the irony is that he wasn't very good at math. But once in a while you get access to the control room  and then you can kind of mess with the dials. And that's what happened there. The fifth thing is that maybe  after       years  Plato is still having his way with us in his notion of perfect forms. He said that we have in our noggin the perfect idea of what we want  and we force environmental resources to accommodate that. So we all have in our head the perfect house  the American dream  which is a house  the dream house. The problem is we can't afford it. So we have the American dream look alike  which is a mobile home. Now there's a blight on the planet. It's a chattel mortgage  just like furniture  just like a car. You write the check  and instantly it depreciates    percent. After a year  you can't get insurance on everything you have in it  only on    percent. Wired with    gauge wire typically. Nothing wrong with that  unless you ask it to do what    gauge wire's supposed to do  and that's what happens. It out gasses formaldehyde so much so that there is a federal law in place to warn new mobile home buyers of the formaldehyde atmosphere danger. Are we just being numbingly stupid  The walls are this thick. The whole thing has the structural value of corn.  So I thought Palm Harbor Village was over there.   No  no. We had a wind last night. It's gone now.  Then when they degrade  what do you do with them  Now  all that  that Apollonian  Platonic model  is what the building industry is predicated on  and there are a number of things that exacerbate that. One is that all the professionals  all the tradesmen  vendors  inspectors  engineers  architects all think like this. And then it works its way back to the consumer  who demands the same model. It's a self fulfilling prophecy. We can't get out of it. Then here come the marketeers and the advertisers.  Woo. Woohooo.  We buy stuff we didn't know we needed. All we have to do is look at what one company did with carbonated prune juice. How disgusting. But you know what they did  They hooked a metaphor into it and said   I drink Dr. Pepper ...  And pretty soon  we're swilling that stuff by the lake ful  by the billions of gallons. It doesn't even have real prunes. Doesn't even keep you regular. My oh my  that makes it worse. And we get sucked into that faster than anything. Then a man named Jean Paul Sartre wrote a book titled  Being and Nothingness.  It's a pretty quick read. You can snap through it in maybe two years if you read eight hours a day. In there he talked about the divided self. He said human beings act differently when they know they're alone than when they know somebody else is around. So if I'm eating spaghetti  and I know I'm alone  I can eat like a backhoe. I can wipe my mouth on my sleeve  napkin on the table  chew with my mouth open  make little noises  scratch wherever I want. But as soon as you walk in  I go   Ooh. Spaghetti sauce there.  Napkin in my lap  half bites  chew with my mouth closed  no scratching. Now what I'm doing is fulfilling your expectations of how I should live my life. I feel that expectation  and so I accommodate it  and I'm living my life according to what you expect me to do. That happens in the building industry as well. That's why all of our subdivisions look the same. Sometimes we even have these formalized cultural expectations. I'll bet all your shoes match. Sure enough  we all buy into that  and with gated communities  we have a formalized expectation with a homeowners association. Sometimes those guys are Nazis  my oh my. That exacerbates and continues this model. The last thing is gregariousness. Human beings are a social species. We like to hang together in groups  just like wildebeests  just like lions. Wildebeests don't hang with lions because lions eat wildebeests. Human beings are like that. We do what that group does that we're trying to identify with. And so you see this in junior high a lot. Those kids  they'll work all summer long  kill themselves  so that they can afford one pair of designer jeans. So along about September they can stride in and go   I'm important today. See  look  don't touch my designer jeans. I see you don't have designer jeans. You're not one of the beautiful people. See  I'm one of the beautiful people. See my jeans   Right there is reason enough to have uniforms. And so that happens in the building industry as well. We have confused Maslow's hierarchy of needs just a little bit. On the bottom tier we have basic needs    shelter  clothing  food  water  mating and so forth. Second  security. Third  relationships. Fourth  status  self esteem    that is  vanity. And we're taking vanity and shoving it down here. And so we end up with vain decisions and we can't even afford our mortgage. We can't even afford to eat anything except beans. That is  our housing has become a commodity. And it takes a little bit of nerve to dive into those primal  terrifying parts of ourselves and make our own decisions and not make our housing a commodity  but make it something that bubbles up from seminal sources. That takes a little bit of nerve  and  darn it  once in a while you fail. But that's okay. If failure destroys you  then you can't do this. I fail all the time  every day  and I've had some whopping failures  I promise  big  public  humiliating  embarrassing failures. Everybody points and laughs  and they say   He tried it a fifth time and it still didn't work. What a moron.  Early on  contractors come by and say   Dan  you're a cute little bunny  but you know  this just isn't going to work. What don't you do this  and why don't you do that   And your instinct is to say   Why don't you suck an egg   But you don't say that  because they're the guys you're targeting. And so what we've done    and this isn't just in housing. It's in clothing and food and our transportation needs  our energy    we sprawl just a little bit. And when I get a little bit of press  I hear from people all over the world. And we may have invented excess  but the problem of waste is worldwide. We're in trouble. And I don't wear ammo belts crisscrossing my chest and a red bandana  but we're clearly in trouble. And what we need to do is reconnect with those really primal parts of ourselves and make some decisions and say   You know  I think I would like to put CDs across the wall there. What do you think  honey   If it doesn't work  take it down. What we need to do is reconnect with who we really are  and that's thrilling indeed. Thank you very much. Hello. My name is Birke Baehr  and I'm    years old. I came here today to talk about what's wrong with our food system. First of all  I would like to say that I'm really amazed at how easily kids are led to believe all the marketing and advertising on TV  at public schools and pretty much everywhere else you look. It seems to me like corporations are always trying to get kids  like me  to get their parents to buy stuff that really isn't good for us or the planet. Little kids  especially  are attracted by colorful packaging and plastic toys. I must admit  I used to be one of them. I also used to think that all of our food came from these happy  little farms where pigs rolled in mud and cows grazed on grass all day. What I discovered was this is not true. I began to look into this stuff on the Internet  in books and in documentary films  in my travels with my family. I discovered the dark side of the industrialized food system. First  there's genetically engineered seeds and organisms. That is when a seed is manipulated in a laboratory to do something not intended by nature    like taking the DNA of a fish and putting it into the DNA of a tomato. Yuck. Don't get me wrong  I like fish and tomatoes  but this is just creepy. The seeds are then planted  then grown. The food they produce have been proven to cause cancer and other problems in lab animals  and people have been eating food produced this way since the     s. And most folks don't even know they exist. Did you know rats that ate genetically engineered corn had developed signs of liver and kidney toxicity  These include kidney inflammation and lesions and increased kidney weight. Yet almost all the corn we eat has been altered genetically in some way. And let me tell you  corn is in everything. And don't even get me started on the Confined Animal Feeding Operations called CAFOS. Conventional farmers use chemical fertilizers made from fossil fuels that they mix with the dirt to make plants grow. They do this because they've stripped the soil from all nutrients from growing the same crop over and over again. Next  more harmful chemicals are sprayed on fruits and vegetables  like pesticides and herbicides  to kill weeds and bugs. When it rains  these chemicals seep into the ground  or run off into our waterways  poisoning our water too. Then they irradiate our food  trying to make it last longer  so it can travel thousands of miles from where it's grown to the supermarkets. So I ask myself  how can I change  How can I change these things  This is what I found out. I discovered that there's a movement for a better way. Now a while back  I wanted to be an NFL football player. I decided that I'd rather be an organic farmer instead. Thank you. And that way I can have a greater impact on the world. This man  Joel Salatin  they call him a lunatic farmer because he grows against the system. Since I'm home schooled  I went to go hear him speak one day. This man  this  lunatic farmer   doesn't use any pesticides  herbicides  or genetically modified seeds. And so for that  he's called crazy by the system. I want you to know that we can all make a difference by making different choices  by buying our food directly from local farmers  or our neighbors who we know in real life. Some people say organic or local food is more expensive  but is it really  With all these things I've been learning about the food system  it seems to me that we can either pay the farmer  or we can pay the hospital. Now I know definitely which one I would choose. I want you to know that there are farms out there    like Bill Keener in Sequatchie Cove Farm in Tennessee    whose cows do eat grass and whose pigs do roll in the mud  just like I thought. Sometimes I go to Bill's farm and volunteer  so I can see up close and personal where the meat I eat comes from. I want you to know that I believe kids will eat fresh vegetables and good food if they know more about it and where it really comes from. I want you to know that there are farmers' markets in every community popping up. I want you to know that me  my brother and sister actually like eating baked kale chips. I try to share this everywhere I go. Not too long ago  my uncle said that he offered my six year old cousin cereal. He asked him if he wanted organic Toasted O's or the sugarcoated flakes    you know  the one with the big striped cartoon character on the front. My little cousin told his dad that he would rather have the organic Toasted O's cereal because Birke said he shouldn't eat sparkly cereal. And that  my friends  is how we can make a difference one kid at a time. So next time you're at the grocery store  think local  choose organic  know your farmer and know your food. Thank you. Well  the subject of difficult negotiation reminds me of one of my favorite stories from the Middle East  of a man who left to his three sons     camels. To the first son  he left half the camels  to the second son  he left a third of the camels  and to the youngest son  he left a ninth of the camels. The three sons got into a negotiation       doesn't divide by two. It doesn't divide by three. It doesn't divide by nine. Brotherly tempers started to get strained. Finally  in desperation  they went and they consulted a wise old woman. The wise old woman thought about their problem for a long time  and finally she came back and said   Well  I don't know if I can help you  but at least  if you want  you can have my camel.  So then  they had    camels. The first son took his half    half of    is nine. The second son took his third    a third of    is six. The youngest son took his ninth    a ninth of    is two. You get   . They had one camel left over. They gave it back to the wise old woman. Now  if you think about that story for a moment  I think it resembles a lot of the difficult negotiations we get involved in. They start off like    camels  no way to resolve it. Somehow  what we need to do is step back from those situations  like that wise old woman  look at the situation through fresh eyes and come up with an   th camel. Finding that   th camel in the world's conflicts has been my life passion. I basically see humanity a bit like those three brothers. We're all one family. We know that scientifically  thanks to the communications revolution  all the tribes on the planet    all        tribes    are in touch with each other. And it's a big family reunion. And yet  like many family reunions  it's not all peace and light. There's a lot of conflict  and the question is  How do we deal with our differences  How do we deal with our deepest differences  given the human propensity for conflict and the human genius at devising weapons of enormous destruction  That's the question. As I've spent the last better part of three decades  almost four  traveling the world  trying to work  getting involved in conflicts ranging from Yugoslavia to the Middle East to Chechnya to Venezuela    some of the most difficult conflicts on the face of the planet    I've been asking myself that question. And I think I've found  in some ways  what is the secret to peace. It's actually surprisingly simple. It's not easy  but it's simple. It's not even new. It may be one of our most ancient human heritages. The secret to peace is us. It's us who act as a surrounding community around any conflict  who can play a constructive role. Let me give you just a story  an example. About    years ago  I was in South Africa  working with the parties in that conflict  and I had an extra month  so I spent some time living with several groups of San Bushmen. I was curious about them  about the way in which they resolve conflict. Because  after all  within living memory  they were hunters and gatherers  living pretty much like our ancestors lived for maybe    percent of the human story. And all the men have these poison arrows that they use for hunting    absolutely fatal. So how do they deal with their differences  Well  what I learned is  whenever tempers rise in those communities  someone goes and hides the poison arrows out in the bush  and then everyone sits around in a circle like this  and they sit and they talk and they talk. It may take two days  three days  four days  but they don't rest until they find a resolution or better yet    a reconciliation. And if tempers are still too high  then they send someone off to visit some relatives  as a cooling off period. Well  that system is  I think  probably the system that kept us alive to this point  given our human tendencies. That system  I call  the third side.  Because if you think about it  normally when we think of conflict  when we describe it  there's always two sides    it's Arabs versus Israelis  labor versus management  husband versus wife  Republicans versus Democrats. But what we don't often see is that there's always a third side  and the third side of the conflict is us  it's the surrounding community  it's the friends  the allies  the family members  the neighbors. And we can play an incredibly constructive role. Perhaps the most fundamental way in which the third side can help is to remind the parties of what's really at stake. For the sake of the kids  for the sake of the family  for the sake of the community  for the sake of the future  let's stop fighting for a moment and start talking. Because  the thing is  when we're involved in conflict  it's very easy to lose perspective. It's very easy to react. Human beings    we're reaction machines. And as the saying goes  when angry  you will make the best speech you will ever regret. And so the third side reminds us of that. The third side helps us go to the balcony  which is a metaphor for a place of perspective  where we can keep our eyes on the prize. Let me tell you a little story from my own negotiating experience. Some years ago  I was involved as a facilitator in some very tough talks between the leaders of Russia and the leaders of Chechnya. There was a war going on  as you know. And we met in the Hague  in the Peace Palace  in the same room where the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal was taking place. And the talks got off to a rather rocky start when the vice president of Chechnya began by pointing at the Russians and said   You should stay right here in your seats  because you're going to be on trial for war crimes.  And then he turned to me and said   You're an American. Look at what you Americans are doing in Puerto Rico.  And my mind started racing   Puerto Rico  What do I know about Puerto Rico   I started reacting. But then  I tried to remember to go to the balcony. And then when he paused and everyone looked at me for a response  from a balcony perspective  I was able to thank him for his remarks and say   I appreciate your criticism of my country and I take it as a sign that we're among friends and can speak candidly to one another.   And what we're here to do is not to talk about Puerto Rico or the past. We're here to see if we can figure out a way to stop the suffering and the bloodshed in Chechnya.  The conversation got back on track. That's the role of the third side  to help the parties go to the balcony. Now let me take you  for a moment  to what's widely regarded as the world's most difficult conflict  or the most impossible conflict  the Middle East. Question is  where's the third side there  How could we possibly go to the balcony  Now  I don't pretend to have an answer to the Middle East conflict  but I think I've got a first step    literally  a first step    something that any one of us could do as third siders. Let me just ask you one question first. How many of you in the last years have ever found yourself worrying about the Middle East and wondering what anyone could do  Just out of curiosity  how many of you  OK  so the great majority of us. And here  it's so far away. Why do we pay so much attention to this conflict  Is it the number of deaths  There are a hundred times more people who die in a conflict in Africa than in the Middle East. No  it's because of the story  because we feel personally involved in that story. Whether we're Christians  Muslims or Jews  religious or non religious  we feel we have a personal stake in it. Stories matter  as an anthropologist  I know that. Stories are what we use to transmit knowledge. They give meaning to our lives. That's what we tell here at TED  we tell stories. Stories are the key. And so my question is    yes  let's try and resolve the politics there in the Middle East  but let's also take a look at the story. Let's try to get at the root of what it's all about. Let's see if we can apply the third side to it. What would that mean  What is the story there  Now  as anthropologists  we know that every culture has an origin story. What's the origin story of the Middle East  In a phrase  it's  Four thousand years ago  a man and his family walked across the Middle East  and the world has never been the same since. That man  of course  was Abraham. And what he stood for was unity  the unity of the family  he's the father of us all. But it's not just what he stood for  it's what his message was. His basic message was unity too  the interconnectedness of it all  the unity of it all. And his basic value was respect  was kindness toward strangers. That's what he's known for  his hospitality. So in that sense  he's the symbolic third side of the Middle East. He's the one who reminds us that we're all part of a greater whole. Now  think about that for a moment. Today  we face the scourge of terrorism. What is terrorism  Terrorism is basically taking an innocent stranger and treating them as an enemy whom you kill in order to create fear. What's the opposite of terrorism  It's taking an innocent stranger and treating them as a friend whom you welcome into your home  in order to sow and create understanding or respect  or love. So what if  then  you took the story of Abraham  which is a third side story  what if that could be    because Abraham stands for hospitality    what if that could be an antidote to terrorism  What if that could be a vaccine against religious intolerance  How would you bring that story to life  Now  it's not enough just to tell a story. That's powerful  but people need to experience the story. They need to be able to live the story. How would you do that  And that was my thinking of how would you do that. And that's what comes to the first step here. Because the simple way to do that is  you go for a walk. You go for a walk in the footsteps of Abraham. You retrace the footsteps of Abraham. Because walking has a real power. You know  as an anthropologist  walking is what made us human. It's funny    when you walk  you walk side by side  in the same common direction. Now if I were to come to you face to face and come this close to you  you would feel threatened. But if I walk shoulder to shoulder  even touching shoulders  it's no problem. Who fights while they walk  That's why in negotiations  often  when things get tough  people go for walks in the woods. So the idea came to me of  what about inspiring a path  a route    think the Silk Route  think the Appalachian Trail    that followed in the footsteps of Abraham  People said   That's crazy. You can't. You can't retrace the footsteps of Abraham    it's too insecure  you've got to cross all these borders  it goes across    different countries in the Middle East  because it unites them all.  And so we studied the idea at Harvard. We did our due diligence. And then a few years ago  a group of us  about    of us from    different countries  decided to see if we could retrace the footsteps of Abraham  going from his initial birthplace in the city of Urfa in Southern Turkey  Northern Mesopotamia. And we then took a bus and took some walks and went to Harran  where  in the Bible  he sets off on his journey. Then we crossed the border into Syria  went to Aleppo  which  turns out  is named after Abraham. We went to Damascus  which has a long history associated with Abraham. We then came to Northern Jordan  to Jerusalem    which is all about Abraham    to Bethlehem  and finally  to the place where he's buried  in Hebron. So effectively  we went from womb to tomb. We showed it could be done. It was an amazing journey. Let me ask you a question. How many of you have had the experience of being in a strange neighborhood or strange land  and a total stranger  perfect stranger  comes up to you and shows you some kindness    maybe invites you into their home  gives you a drink  gives you a coffee  gives you a meal  How many of you have ever had that experience  That's the essence of the Abraham Path. That's what you discover as you go into these villages in the Middle East where you expect hostility  and you get the most amazing hospitality  all associated with Abraham   In the name of Father Ibrahim  let me offer you some food.  So what we discovered is that Abraham is not just a figure out of a book for those people  he's alive  he's a living presence. And to make a long story short  in the last couple of years now  thousands of people have begun to walk parts of the path of Abraham in the Middle East  enjoying the hospitality of the people there. They've begun to walk in Israel and Palestine  in Jordan  in Turkey  in Syria. It's an amazing experience. Men  women  young people  old people    more women than men  actually  interestingly. For those who can't walk  who are unable to get there right now  people started to organize walks in cities  in their own communities. In Cincinnati  for instance  they organized a walk from a church to a mosque to a synagogue and all had an Abrahamic meal together. It was Abraham Path Day. In S o Paulo  Brazil  it's become an annual event for thousands of people to run in a virtual Abraham Path Run  uniting the different communities. The media love it  they really adore it. They lavish attention on it because it's visual and it spreads the idea  this idea of Abrahamic hospitality  of kindness towards strangers. And just a couple weeks ago  there was an NPR story on it. Last month  there was a piece in the Manchester Guardian about it  two whole pages. And they quoted a villager who said   This walk connects us to the world.  He said   It was like a light that went on in our lives    it brought us hope.  And so that's what it's about. But it's not just about psychology  it's about economics. Because as people walk  they spend money. And this woman right here  Um Ahmad  is a woman who lives on the path in Northern Jordan. She's desperately poor. She's partially blind  her husband can't work  she's got seven kids. But what she can do is cook. And so she's begun to cook for some groups of walkers who come through the village and have a meal in her home. They sit on the floor    she doesn't even have a tablecloth. She makes the most delicious food  that's fresh from the herbs in the surrounding countryside. And so more and more walkers have come  and lately she's begun to earn an income to support her family. And so she told our team there  she said   You have made me visible in a village where people were once ashamed to look at me.  That's the potential of the Abraham Path. There are literally hundreds of those kinds of communities across the Middle East  across the path. The potential is basically to change the game. And to change the game  you have to change the frame  the way we see things    to change the frame from hostility to hospitality  from terrorism to tourism. And in that sense  the Abraham Path is a game changer. Let me just show you one thing. I have a little acorn here that I picked up while I was walking on the path earlier this year. Now  the acorn is associated with the oak tree  of course    grows into an oak tree  which is associated with Abraham. The path right now is like an acorn  it's still in its early phase. What would the oak tree look like  When I think back to my childhood  a good part of which I spent  after being born here in Chicago  I spent in Europe. If you had been in the ruins of  say  London in       or Berlin  and you had said   Sixty years from now  this is going to be the most peaceful  prosperous part of the planet   people would have thought you were certifiably insane. But they did it  thanks to a common identity  Europe  and a common economy. So my question is  if it can be done in Europe  why not in the Middle East  Why not  thanks to a common identity  which is the story of Abraham  and thanks to a common economy that would be based  in good part  on tourism  So let me conclude  then  by saying that in the last    years  as I've worked in some of the most dangerous  difficult and intractable conflicts around the planet  I have yet to see one conflict that I felt could not be transformed. It's not easy  of course. But it's possible. It was done in South Africa. It was done in Northern Ireland. It could be done anywhere. It simply depends on us. It depends on us taking the third side. So let me invite you to consider taking the third side  even as a very small step. We're about to take a break in a moment. Just go up to someone who's from a different culture  a different country  a different ethnicity    some difference    and engage them in a conversation. Listen to them. That's a third side act. That's walking Abraham's Path. After a TED Talk  why not a TED Walk  So let me just leave you with three things. One is  the secret to peace is the third side. The third side is us. Each of us  with a single step  can take the world  can bring the world a step closer to peace. There's an old African proverb that goes   When spiderwebs unite  they can halt even the lion.  If we're able to unite our third side webs of peace  we can even halt the lion of war. Thank you very much. Okay  I'm going to show you again something about our diets. And I would like to know what the audience is  and so who of you ever ate insects  That's quite a lot. But still  you're not representing the overall population of the Earth. Because there's    percent out there that really eats insects. But this is quite good. Why not eat insects  Well first  what are insects  Insects are animals that walk around on six legs. And here you see just a selection. There's six million species of insects on this planet  six million species. There's a few hundreds of mammals    six million species of insects. In fact  if we count all the individual organisms  we would come at much larger numbers. In fact  of all animals on Earth  of all animal species     percent walks on six legs. But if we would count all the individuals  and we take an average weight of them  it would amount to something like     to       kilograms for each of you and me on Earth. That means that in terms of biomass  insects are more abundant than we are  and we're not on a planet of men  but we're on a planet of insects. Insects are not only there in nature  but they also are involved in our economy  usually without us knowing. There was an estimation  a conservative estimation  a couple of years ago that the U.S. economy benefited by    billion dollars per year. It's a number    very large    a contribution to the economy of the United States for free. And so I looked up what the economy was paying for the war in Iraq in the same year. It was    billion U.S. dollars. Well we know that that was not a cheap war. So insects  just for free  contribute to the economy of the United States with about the same order of magnitude  just for free  without everyone knowing. And not only in the States  but in any country  in any economy. What do they do  They remove dung  they pollinate our crops. A third of all the fruits that we eat are all a result of insects taking care of the reproduction of plants. They control pests  and they're food for animals. They're at the start of food chains. Small animals eat insects. Even larger animals eat insects. But the small animals that eat insects are being eaten by larger animals  still larger animals. And at the end of the food chain  we are eating them as well. There's quite a lot of people that are eating insects. And here you see me in a small  provincial town in China  Lijiang    about two million inhabitants. If you go out for dinner  like in a fish restaurant  where you can select which fish you want to eat  you can select which insects you would like to eat. And they prepare it in a wonderful way. And here you see me enjoying a meal with caterpillars  locusts  bee pupae    delicacies. And you can eat something new everyday. There's more than       species of insects that are being eaten all around the globe. That's quite a bit more than just a few mammals that we're eating  like a cow or a pig or a sheep. More than       species    an enormous variety. And now you may think  okay  in this provincial town in China they're doing that  but not us. Well we've seen already that quite some of you already ate insects maybe occasionally  but I can tell you that every one of you is eating insects  without any exception. You're eating at least     grams per year. What are you eating  Tomato soup  peanut butter  chocolate  noodles    any processed food that you're eating contains insects  because insects are here all around us  and when they're out there in nature they're also in our crops. Some fruits get some insect damage. Those are the fruits  if they're tomato  that go to the tomato soup. If they don't have any damage  they go to the grocery. And that's your view of a tomato. But there's tomatoes that end up in a soup  and as long as they meet the requirements of the food agency  there can be all kinds of things in there  no problem. In fact  why would we put these balls in the soup  there's meat in there anyway  In fact  all our processed foods contain more proteins than we would be aware of. So anything is a good protein source already. Now you may say   Okay  so we're eating     grams just by accident.  We're even doing this on purpose. In a lot of food items that we have    I have only two items here on the slide    pink cookies or surimi sticks or  if you like  Campari    a lot of our food products that are of a red color are dyed with a natural dye. The surimi sticks  of  crabmeat  or is being sold as crab meat  is white fish that's being dyed with cochineal. Cochineal is a product of an insect that lives off these cacti. It's being produced in large amounts      to     metric tons per year in the Canary Islands in Peru  and it's big business. One gram of cochineal costs about    euros. One gram of gold is    euros. So it's a very precious thing that we're using to dye our foods. Now the situation in the world is going to change for you and me  for everyone on this Earth. The human population is growing very rapidly and is growing exponentially. Where  at the moment  we have something between six and seven billion people  it will grow to about nine billion in     . That means that we have a lot more mouths to feed  and this is something that worries more and more people. There was an FAO conference last October that was completely devoted to this. How are we going to feed this world  And if you look at the figures up there  it says that we have a third more mouths to feed  but we need an agricultural production increase of    percent. And that's especially because this world population is increasing  and it's increasing  not only in numbers  but we're also getting wealthier  and anyone that gets wealthier starts to eat more and also starts to eat more meat. And meat  in fact  is something that costs a lot of our agricultural production. Our diet consists   in  some part  of animal proteins  and at the moment  most of us here get it from livestock  from fish  from game. And we eat quite a lot of it. In the developed world it's on average    kilograms per person per year  which goes up to     in the United States and a bit lower in some other countries  but on average    kilograms per person per year. In the developing world it's much lower. It's    kilograms per person per year. But it's increasing enormously. In China in the last    years  it increased from    to     and it's still increasing. So if a third of the world population is going to increase its meat consumption from    to    on average  and a third of the world population is living in China and in India  we're having an enormous demand on meat. And of course  we are not there to say that's only for us  it's not for them. They have the same share that we have. Now to start with  I should say that we are eating way too much meat in the Western world. We could do with much  much less    and I know  I've been a vegetarian for a long time  and you can easily do without anything. You'll get proteins in any kind of food anyway. But then there's a lot of problems that come with meat production  and we're being faced with that more and more often. The first problem that we're facing is human health. Pigs are quite like us. They're even models in medicine  and we can even transplant organs from a pig to a human. That means that pigs also share diseases with us. And a pig disease  a pig virus  and a human virus can both proliferate  and because of their kind of reproduction  they can combine and produce a new virus. This has happened in the Netherlands in the     s during the classical swine fever outbreak. You get a new disease that can be deadly. We eat insects    they're so distantly related from us that this doesn't happen. So that's one point for insects. And there's the conversion factor. You take    kilograms of feed  you can get one kilogram of beef  but you can get nine kilograms of locust meat. So if you would be an entrepreneur  what would you do  With    kilograms of input  you can get either one or nine kg. of output. So far we're taking the one  or up to five kilograms of output. We're not taking the bonus yet. We're not taking the nine kilograms of output yet. So that's two points for insects. And there's the environment. If we take    kilograms of food    and it results in one kilogram of beef  the other nine kilograms are waste  and a lot of that is manure. If you produce insects  you have less manure per kilogram of meat that you produce. So less waste. Furthermore  per kilogram of manure  you have much  much less ammonia and fewer greenhouse gases when you have insect manure than when you have cow manure. So you have less waste  and the waste that you have is not as environmental malign as it is with cow dung. So that's three points for insects. Now there's a big  if   of course  and it is if insects produce meat that is of good quality. Well there have been all kinds of analyses and in terms of protein  or fat  or vitamins  it's very good. In fact  it's comparable to anything we eat as meat at the moment. And even in terms of calories  it is very good. One kilogram of grasshoppers has the same amount of calories as    hot dogs  or six Big Macs. So that's four points for insects. I can go on  and I could make many more points for insects  but time doesn't allow this. So the question is  why not eat insects  I gave you at least four arguments in favor. We'll have to. Even if you don't like it  you'll have to get used to this because at the moment     percent of all our agricultural land is being used to produce livestock. That's not only the land where the livestock is walking and feeding  but it's also other areas where the feed is being produced and being transported. We can increase it a bit at the expense of rainforests  but there's a limitation very soon. And if you remember that we need to increase agricultural production by    percent  we're not going to make it that way. We could much better change from meat  from beef  to insects. And then    percent of the world already eats insects  so we are just a minority    in a country like the U.K.  the USA  the Netherlands  anywhere. On the left hand side  you see a market in Laos where they have abundantly present all kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night. On the right hand side you see a grasshopper. So people there are eating them  not because they're hungry  but because they think it's a delicacy. It's just very good food. You can vary enormously. It has many benefits. In fact  we have delicacy that's very much like this grasshopper  shrimps  a delicacy being sold at a high price. Who wouldn't like to eat a shrimp  There are a few people who don't like shrimp  but shrimp  or crabs  or crayfish  are very closely related. They are delicacies. In fact  a locust is a  shrimp  of the land  and it would make very good into our diet. So why are we not eating insects yet  Well that's just a matter of mindset. We're not used to it  and we see insects as these organisms that are very different from us. That's why we're changing the perception of insects. And I'm working very hard with my colleague  Arnold van Huis  in telling people what insects are  what magnificent things they are  what magnificent jobs they do in nature. And in fact  without insects  we would not be here in this room  because if the insects die out  we will soon die out as well. If we die out  the insects will continue very happily. So we have to get used to the idea of eating insects. And some might think  well they're not yet available. Well they are. There are entrepreneurs in the Netherlands that produce them  and one of them is here in the audience  Marian Peeters  who's in the picture. I predict that later this year  you'll get them in the supermarkets    not visible  but as animal protein in the food. And maybe by       you'll buy them just knowing that this is an insect that you're going to eat. And they're being made in the most wonderful ways. A Dutch chocolate maker. So there's even a lot of design to it. Well in the Netherlands  we have an innovative Minister of Agriculture  and she puts the insects on the menu in her restaurant in her ministry. And when she got all the Ministers of Agriculture of the E.U. over to the Hague recently  she went to a high class restaurant  and they ate insects all together. It's not something that is a hobby of mine. It's really taken off the ground. So why not eat insects  You should try it yourself. A couple of years ago  we had       people all together in a square in Wageningen town  and they ate insects at the same moment  and this was still big  big news. I think soon it will not be big news anymore when we all eat insects  because it's just a normal way of doing. So you can try it yourself today  and I would say  enjoy. And I'm going to show to Bruno some first tries  and he can have the first bite. Bruno Giussani  Look at them first. Look at them first. Marcel Dicke  It's all protein. BG  That's exactly the same  one  you saw in the video actually. And it looks delicious. They just make it  with  nuts or something. MD  Thank you. I'm here today to share with you an extraordinary journey   extraordinarily rewarding journey  actually   which brought me into training rats to save human lives by detecting landmines and tuberculosis. As a child  I had two passions. One was a passion for rodents. I had all kinds of rats  mice  hamsters  gerbils  squirrels. You name it  I bred it  and I sold them to pet shops. I also had a passion for Africa. Growing up in a multicultural environment  we had African students in the house  and I learned about their stories  so different backgrounds  dependency on imported know how  goods  services  exuberant cultural diversity. Africa was truly fascinating for me. I became an industrial engineer  engineer in product development  and I focused on appropriate detection technologies  actually the first appropriate technologies for developing countries. I started working in the industry  but I wasn't really happy to contribute to a material consumer society in a linear  extracting and manufacturing mode. I quit my job to focus on the real world problem  landmines. We're talking '   now. Princess Diana is announcing on TV that landmines form a structural barrier to any development  which is really true. As long as these devices are there  or there is suspicion of landmines  you can't really enter into the land. Actually  there was an appeal worldwide for new detectors sustainable in the environments where they're needed to produce  which is mainly in the developing world. We chose rats. Why would you choose rats  Because  aren't they vermin  Well  actually rats are  in contrary to what most people think about them  rats are highly sociable creatures. And actually  our product    what you see here. There's a target somewhere here. You see an operator  a trained African with his rats in front who actually are left and right. There  the animal finds a mine. It scratches on the soil. And the animal comes back for a food reward. Very  very simple. Very sustainable in this environment. Here  the animal gets its food reward. And that's how it works. Very  very simple. Now why would you use rats  Rats have been used since the '  s last century  in all kinds of experiments. Rats have more genetic material allocated to olfaction than any other mammal species. They're extremely sensitive to smell. Moreover  they have the mechanisms to map all these smells and to communicate about it. Now how do we communicate with rats  Well don't talk rat  but we have a clicker  a standard method for animal training  which you see there. A clicker  which makes a particular sound with which you can reinforce particular behaviors. First of all  we associate the click sound with a food reward  which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe. Once the animal knows click  food  click  food  click  food    so click is food    we bring it in a cage with a hole  and actually the animal learns to stick the nose in the hole under which a target scent is placed  and to do that for five seconds    five seconds  which is long for a rat. Once the animal knows this  we make the task a bit more difficult. It learns how to find the target smell in a cage with several holes  up to    holes. Then the animal learns to walk on a leash in the open and find targets. In the next step  animals learn to find real mines in real minefields. They are tested and accredited according to International Mine Action Standards  just like dogs have to pass a test. This consists of     square meters. There's a number of mines placed blindly  and the team of trainer and their rat have to find all the targets. If the animal does that  it gets a license as an accredited animal to be operational in the field    just like dogs  by the way. Maybe one slight difference  we can train rats at a fifth of the price of training the mining dog. This is our team in Mozambique  one Tanzanian trainer  who transfers the skills to these three Mozambican fellows. And you should see the pride in the eyes of these people. They have a skill  which makes them much less dependent on foreign aid. Moreover  this small team together with  of course  you need the heavy vehicles and the manual de miners to follow up. But with this small investment in a rat capacity  we have demonstrated in Mozambique that we can reduce the cost price per square meter up to    percent of what is currently normal    two dollars per square meter  we do it at   .    and we can still bring that price down. Question of scale. If you can bring in more rats  we can actually make the output even bigger. We have a demonstration site in Mozambique. Eleven African governments have seen that they can become less dependent by using this technology. They have signed the pact for peace and treaty in the Great Lakes region  and they endorse hero rats to clear their common borders of landmines. But let me bring you to a very different problem. And there's about       people last year that walked on a landmine  but worldwide last year  almost  .  million died from tuberculosis as a first cause of infection. Especially in Africa where T.B. and HIV are strongly linked  there is a huge common problem. Microscopy  the standard WHO procedure  reaches from    to    percent reliability. In Tanzania    the numbers don't lie       percent of people    T.B. patients    get diagnosed with T.B. before they die. It means that  if you have T.B.  you have more chance that you won't be detected  but will just die from T.B. secondary infections and so on. And if  however  you are detected very early  diagnosed early  treatment can start  and even in HIV positives  it makes sense. You can actually cure T.B.  even in HIV positives. So in our common language  Dutch  the name for T.B. is  tering   which  etymologically  refers to the smell of tar. Already the old Chinese and the Greek  Hippocrates  have actually published  documented  that T.B. can be diagnosed based on the volatiles exuding from patients. So what we did is we collected some samples    just as a way of testing    from hospitals  trained rats on them and see if this works  and wonder  well  we can reach    percent sensitivity     percent specificity using multiple rats in a row. This is how it works  and really  this is a generic technology. We're talking now explosives  tuberculosis  but can you imagine  you can actually put anything under there. So how does it work  You have a cassette with    samples. You put these    samples at once in the cage. An animal only needs two hundredths of a second to discriminate the scent  so it goes extremely fast. Here it's already at the third sample. This is a positive sample. It gets a click sound and comes for the food reward. And by doing so  very fast  we can have like a second line opinion to see which patients are positive  which are negative. Just as an indication  whereas a microscopist can process    samples in a day  a rat can process the same amount of samples in seven minutes only. A cage like this    A cage like this    provided that you have rats  and we have now currently    tuberculosis rats    a cage like this  operating throughout the day  can process       samples. Can you imagine the potential offspring applications    environmental detection of pollutants in soils  customs applications  detection of illicit goods in containers and so on. But let's stick first to tuberculosis. I just want to briefly highlight  the blue rods are the scores of microscopy only at the five clinics in Dar es Salaam on a population of         people  where        reported to get a test done. Microscopy for       patients. And by just presenting the samples once more to the rats and looping those results back  we were able to increase case detection rates by over    percent. Throughout last year  we've been    depending on which intervals you take    we've been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in Dar es Salaam between    and    percent. So this is really considerable. Knowing that a missed patient by microscopy infects up to    people  healthy people  per year  you can be sure that we have saved lots of lives. At least our hero rats have saved lots of lives. The way forward for us is now to standardize this technology. And there are simple things like  for instance  we have a small laser in the sniffer hole where the animal has to stick for five seconds. So  to standardize this. Also  to standardize the pellets  the food rewards  and to semi automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people. To conclude  there are also other applications at the horizon. Here is a first prototype of our camera rat  which is a rat with a rat backpack with a camera that can go under rubble to detect for victims after earthquake and so on. This is in a prototype stage. We don't have a working system here yet. To conclude  I would actually like to say  you may think this is about rats  these projects  but in the end it is about people. It is about empowering vulnerable communities to tackle difficult  expensive and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks  and doing that with a local resource  plenty available. So something completely different is to keep on challenging your perception about the resources surrounding you  whether they are environmental  technological  animal  or human. And to respectfully harmonize with them in order to foster a sustainable world. Thank you very much. Restaurants and the food industry in general are pretty much the most wasteful industry in the world. For every calorie of food that we consume here in Britain today     calories are taken to produce it. That's a lot. I want to take something rather humble to discuss. I found this in the farmers' market today  and if anybody wants to take it home and mash it later  you're very welcome to. The humble potato    and I've spent a long time     years  preparing these. And it pretty much goes through eight different forms in its lifetime. First of all  it's planted  and that takes energy. It grows and is nurtured. It's then harvested. It's then distributed  and distribution is a massive issue. It's then sold and bought  and it's then delivered to me. I basically take it  prepare it  and then people consume it    hopefully they enjoy it. The last stage is basically waste  and this is is pretty much where everybody disregards it. There are different types of waste. There's a waste of time  there's a waste of space  there's a waste of energy  and there's a waste of waste. And every business I've been working on over the past five years  I'm trying to lower each one of these elements. Okay  so you ask what a sustainable restaurant looks like. Basically a restaurant just like any other. This is the restaurant  Acorn House. Front and back. So let me run you through a few ideas. Floor  sustainable  recyclable. Chairs  recycled and recyclable. Tables  Forestry Commission. This is Norwegian Forestry Commission wood. This bench  although it was uncomfortable for my mom    she didn't like sitting on it  so she went and bought these cushions for me from a local jumble sale    reusing  a job that was pretty good. I hate waste  especially walls. If they're not working  put a shelf on it  which I did  and that shows all the customers my products. The whole business is run on sustainable energy. This is powered by wind. All of the lights are daylight bulbs. Paint is all low volume chemical  which is very important when you're working in the room all the time. I was experimenting with these    I don't know if you can see it    but there's a work surface there. And that's a plastic polymer. And I was thinking  well I'm trying to think nature  nature  nature. But I thought  no  no  experiment with resins  experiment with polymers. Will they outlive me  They probably might. Right  here's a reconditioned coffee machine. It actually looks better than a brand new one    so looking good there. Now reusing is vital. And we filter our own water. We put them in bottles  refrigerate them  and then we reuse that bottle again and again and again. Here's a great little example. If you can see this orange tree  it's actually growing in a car tire  which has been turned inside out and sewn up. It's got my compost in it  which is growing an orange tree  which is great. This is the kitchen  which is in the same room. I basically created a menu that allowed people to choose the amount and volume of food that they wanted to consume. Rather than me putting a dish down  they were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted. Okay  it's a small kitchen. It's about five square meters. It serves     people a day. We generate quite a lot of waste. This is the waste room. You can't get rid of waste. But this story's not about eliminating it  it's about minimizing it. In here  I have produce and boxes that are unavoidable. I put my food waste into this dehydrating  desiccating macerator    turns food into an inner material  which I can store and then compost later. I compost it in this garden. All of the soil you can see there is basically my food  which is generated by the restaurant  and it's growing in these tubs  which I made out of storm felled trees and wine casks and all kinds of things. Three compost bins    go through about    kilos of raw vegetable waste a week    really good  makes fantastic compost. A couple of wormeries in there too. And actually one of the wormeries was a big wormery. I had a lot of worms in it. And I tried taking the dried food waste  putting it to the worms  going   There you go  dinner.  It was like vegetable jerky  and killed all of them. I don't know how many worms  were  in there  but I've got some heavy karma coming  I tell you. What you're seeing here is a water filtration system. This takes the water out of the restaurant  runs it through these stone beds    this is going to be mint in there    and I sort of water the garden with it. And I ultimately want to recycle that  put it back into the loos  maybe wash hands with it  I don't know. So  water is a very important aspect. I started meditating on that and created a restaurant called Waterhouse. If I could get Waterhouse to be a no carbon restaurant that is consuming no gas to start with  that would be great. I managed to do it. This restaurant looks a little bit like Acorn House    same chairs  same tables. They're all English and a little bit more sustainable. But this is an electrical restaurant. The whole thing is electric  the restaurant and the kitchen. And it's run on hydroelectricity  so I've gone from air to water. Now it's important to understand that this room is cooled by water  heated by water  filters its own water  and it's powered by water. It literally is Waterhouse. The air handling system inside it    I got rid of air conditioning because I thought there was too much consumption going on there. This is basically air handling. I'm taking the temperature of the canal outside  pumping it through the heat exchange mechanism  it's turning through these amazing sails on the roof  and that  in turn  is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant  cooling them  or heating them  as the need may be. And this is an English willow air diffuser  and that's softly moving that air current through the room. Very advanced  no air conditioning    I love it. In the canal  which is just outside the restaurant  there is hundreds of meters of coil piping. This takes the temperature of the canal and turns it into this four degrees of heat exchange. I have no idea how it works  but I paid a lot of money for it. And what's great is one of the chefs who works in that restaurant lives on this boat    it's off grid  it generates all its own power. He's growing all his own fruit  and that's fantastic. There's no accident in names of these restaurants. Acorn House is the element of wood  Waterhouse is the element of water  and I'm thinking  well  I'm going to be making five restaurants based on the five Chinese medicine acupuncture specialities. I've got water and wood. I'm just about to do fire. I've got metal and earth to come. So you've got to watch your space for that. Okay. So this is my next project. Five weeks old  it's my baby  and it's hurting real bad. The People's Supermarket. So basically  the restaurants only really hit people who believed in what I was doing anyway. What I needed to do was get food out to a broader spectrum of people. So people    i.e.  perhaps  more working class    or perhaps people who actually believe in a cooperative. This is a social enterprise  not for profit cooperative supermarket. It really is about the social disconnect between food  communities in urban settings and their relationship to rural growers    connecting communities in London to rural growers. Really important. So I'm committing to potatoes  I'm committing to milk  I'm committing to leeks and broccoli    all very important stuff. I've kept the tiles  I've kept the floors  I've kept the trunking  I've got in some recycled fridges  I've got some recycled tills  I've got some recycled trolleys. I mean  the whole thing is is super sustainable. In fact  I'm trying and I'm going to make this the most sustainable supermarket in the world. That's zero food waste. And no one's doing that just yet. In fact  Sainsbury's  if you're watching  let's have a go. Try it on. I'm going to get there before you. So nature doesn't create waste doesn't create waste as such. Everything in nature is used up in a closed continuous cycle with waste being the end of the beginning  and that's been something that's been nurturing me for some time  and it's an important statement to understand. If we don't stand up and make a difference and think about sustainable food  think about the sustainable nature of it  then we may fail. But  I wanted to get up and show you that we can do it if we're more responsible. Environmentally conscious businesses are doable. They're here. You can see I've done three so far  I've got a few more to go. The idea is embryonic. I think it's important. I think that if we reduce  reuse  refuse and recycle    right at the end there    recycling is the last point I want to make  but it's the four R's  rather than the three R's    then I think we're going to be on our way. So these three are not perfect    they're ideas. I think that there are many problems to come  but with help  I'm sure I'm going to find solutions. And I hope you all take part. Thank you very much.  Applause  It sure used to be a lot easier to be from Iceland  because until a couple of years ago  people knew hardly anything about us  and I could basically come out here and say only good things about us. But in the last couple of years we've become infamous for a couple of things. First  of course  the economic meltdown. It actually got so bad that somebody put our country up for sale on eBay. Ninety nine pence was the starting price and no reserve. Then there was the volcano that interrupted the travel plans of almost all of you and many of your friends  including President Obama. By the way  the pronunciation is  Eyjafjallajokull.  None of your media got it right. But I'm not here to share these stories about these two things exactly. I'm here to tell you the story of Audur Capital  which is a financial firm founded by me and Kristin    who you see in the picture    in the spring of       just over a year before the economic collapse hit. Why would two women who were enjoying successful careers in investment banking in the corporate sector leave to found a financial services firm  Well let it suffice to say that we felt a bit overwhelmed with testosterone. And I'm not here to say that men are to blame for the crisis and what happened in my country. But I can surely tell you that in my country  much like on Wall Street and the city of London and elsewhere  men were at the helm of the game of the financial sector  and that kind of lack of diversity and sameness leads to disastrous problems. So we decided  a bit fed up with this world and also with the strong feeling in our stomach that this wasn't sustainable  to found a financial services firm based on our values  and we decided to incorporate feminine values into the world of finance. Raised quite a few eyebrows in Iceland. We weren't known as the typical  women  women in Iceland up until then. So it was almost like coming out of the closet to actually talk about the fact that we were women and that we believed that we had a set of values and a way of doing business that would be more sustainable than what we had experienced until then. And we got a great group of people to join us    principled people with great skills  and investors with a vision and values to match ours. And together we got through the eye of the financial storm in Iceland without taking any direct losses to our equity or to the funds of our clients. And although I want to thank the talented people of our company foremost for that    and also there's a factor of luck and timing    we are absolutely convinced that we did this because of our values. So let me share with you our values. We believe in risk awareness. What does that mean  We believe that you should always understand the risks that you're taking  and we will not invest in things we don't understand. Not a complicated thing. But in       at the height of the sub prime and all the complicated financial structures  it was quite opposite to the reckless risk taking behaviors that we saw on the market. We also believe in straight talking  telling it as it is  using simple language that people understand  telling people about the downsides as well as the potential upsides  and even telling the bad news that no one wants to utter  like our lack of belief in the sustainability of the Icelandic financial sector that already we had months before the collapse hit us. And  although we do work in the financial sector  where Excel is king  we believe in emotional capital. And we believe that doing emotional due diligence is just as important as doing financial due diligence. It is actually people that make money and lose money  not Excel spreadsheets. Last  but not least  we believe in profit with principles. We care how we make our profit. So while we want to make economic profit for ourselves and our customers  we are willing to do it with a long term view  and we like to have a wider definition of profits than just the economic profit in the next quarter. So we like to see profits  plus positive social and environmental benefits  when we invest. But it wasn't just about the values  although we are convinced that they matter. It was also about a business opportunity. It's the female trend  and it's the sustainability trend  that are going to create some of the most interesting investment opportunities in the years to come. The whole thing about the female trend is not about women being better than men  it is actually about women being different from men  bringing different values and different ways to the table. So what do you get  You get better decision making  and you get less herd behavior  and both of those things hit your bottom line with very positive results. But one has to wonder  now that we've had this financial sector collapse upon us in Iceland    and by the way  Europe looks pretty bad right now  and many would say that you in America are heading for some more trouble as well. Now that we've had all that happen  and we have all this data out there telling us that it's much better to have diversity around the decision making tables  will we see business and finance change  Will government change  Well I'll give you my straight talk about this. I have days that I believe  but I have days that I'm full of doubt. Have you seen the incredible urge out there to rebuild the very things that failed us  Einstein said that this was the definition of insanity    to do the same things over and over again  hoping for a different outcome. So I guess the world is insane  because I see entirely too much of doing the same things over and over again  hoping that this time it's not going to collapse upon us. I want to see more revolutionary thinking  and I remain hopeful. Like TED  I believe in people. And I know that consumers are becoming more conscious  and they are going to start voting with their wallets  and they are going to change the face of business and finance from the outside  if they don't do it from the inside. But I'm more of the revolutionary  and I should be  I'm from Iceland. We have a long history of strong  courageous  independent women  ever since the Viking age. And I want to tell you when I first realized that women matter to the economy and to the society  I was seven    it happened to be my mother's birthday    October         . Women in Iceland took the day off. From work or from home  they took the day off  and nothing worked in Iceland. They marched into the center of Reykjavik  and they put women's issues onto the agenda. And some say this was the start of a global movement. For me it was the start of a long journey  but I decided that day to matter. Five years later  Iceland elected Vigdis Finnbogadottir as their president    first female to become head of state  single mom  a breast cancer survivor who had had one of her breasts removed. And at one of the campaign sessions  she had one of her male contenders allude to the fact that she couldn't become president    she was a woman  and even half a woman. That night she won the election  because she came back    not just because of his crappy behavior    but she came back and said   Well  I'm actually not going to breastfeed the Icelandic nation  I'm going to lead it.  So I've had incredibly many women role models that have influenced who I am and where I am today. But in spite of that  I went through the first    or    years of my career mostly in denial of being a woman. Started in corporate America  and I was absolutely convinced that it was just about the individual  that women and men would have just the same opportunities. But I've come to conclude lately that it isn't like that. We are not the same  and it's great. Because of our differences  we create and sustain life. So we should embrace our difference and aim for challenge. The final thought I want to leave with you is that I'm fed up with this tyranny of either or choices in life    either it's men or it's women. We need to start embracing the beauty of balance. So let's move away from thinking about business here and philanthropy there  and let's start thinking about doing good business. That's how we change the world. That's the only sustainable future. Thank you. I grew up in New York City  between Harlem and the Bronx. Growing up as a boy  we were taught that men had to be tough  had to be strong  had to be courageous  dominating    no pain  no emotions  with the exception of anger    and definitely no fear  that men are in charge  which means women are not  that men lead  and you should just follow and do what we say  that men are superior  women are inferior  that men are strong  women are weak  that women are of less value  property of men  and objects  particularly sexual objects. I've later come to know that to be the collective socialization of men  better known as the  man box.  See this man box has in it all the ingredients of how we define what it means to be a man. Now I also want to say  without a doubt  there are some wonderful  wonderful  absolutely wonderful things about being a man. But at the same time  there's some stuff that's just straight up twisted  and we really need to begin to challenge  look at it and really get in the process of deconstructing  redefining  what we come to know as manhood. This is my two at home  Kendall and Jay. They're    and   . Kendall's    months older than Jay. There was a period of time when my wife    her name is Tammie    and I  we just got real busy and whip  bam  boom  Kendall and Jay. And when they were about five and six  four and five  Jay could come to me  come to me crying. It didn't matter what she was crying about  she could get on my knee  she could snot my sleeve up  just cry  cry it out. Daddy's got you. That's all that's important. Now Kendall on the other hand    and like I said  he's only    months older than her    he'd come to me crying  it's like as soon as I would hear him cry  a clock would go off. I would give the boy probably about    seconds  which means  by the time he got to me  I was already saying things like   Why are you crying  Hold your head up. Look at me. Explain to me what's wrong. Tell me what's wrong. I can't understand you. Why are you crying   And out of my own frustration of my role and responsibility of building him up as a man to fit into these guidelines and these structures that are defining this man box  I would find myself saying things like   Just go in your room. Just go on  go on in your room. Sit down  get yourself together and come back and talk to me when you can talk to me like a     what  Like a man. And he's five years old. And as I grow in life  I would say to myself   My God  what's wrong with me  What am I doing  Why would I do this   And I think back. I think back to my father. There was a time in my life where we had a very troubled experience in our family. My brother  Henry  he died tragically when we were teenagers. We lived in New York City  as I said. We lived in the Bronx at the time  and the burial was in a place called Long Island  it was about two hours outside of the city. And as we were preparing to come back from the burial  the cars stopped at the bathroom to let folks take care of themselves before the long ride back to the city. And the limousine empties out. My mother  my sister  my auntie  they all get out  but my father and I stayed in the limousine  and no sooner than the women got out  he burst out crying. He didn't want cry in front of me  but he knew he wasn't going to make it back to the city  and it was better me than to allow himself to express these feelings and emotions in front of the women. And this is a man who     minutes ago  had just put his teenage son in the ground    something I just can't even imagine. The thing that sticks with me the most is that he was apologizing to me for crying in front of me  and at the same time  he was also giving me props  lifting me up  for not crying. I come to also look at this as this fear that we have as men  this fear that just has us paralyzed  holding us hostage to this man box. I can remember speaking to a    year old boy  a football player  and I asked him  I said   How would you feel if  in front of all the players  your coach told you you were playing like a girl   Now I expected him to say something like  I'd be sad  I'd be mad  I'd be angry  or something like that. No  the boy said to me    the boy said to me   It would destroy me.  And I said to myself   God  if it would destroy him to be called a girl  what are we then teaching him about girls   It took me back to a time when I was about    years old. I grew up in tenement buildings in the inner city. At this time we're living in the Bronx  and in the building next to where I lived there was a guy named Johnny. He was about    years old  and we were all about    years old    younger guys. And he was hanging out with all us younger guys. And this guy  he was up to a lot of no good. He was the kind of kid who parents would have to wonder   What is this    year old boy doing with these    year old boys   And he did spend a lot of time up to no good. He was a troubled kid. His mother had died from a heroin overdose. He was being raised by his grandmother. His father wasn't on the set. His grandmother had two jobs. He was home alone a lot. But I've got to tell you  we young guys  we looked up to this dude  man. He was cool. He was fine. That's what the sisters said   He was fine.  He was having sex. We all looked up to him. So one day  I'm out in front of the house doing something    just playing around  doing something    I don't know what. He looks out his window  he calls me upstairs  he said   Hey Anthony.  They called me Anthony growing up as a kid.  Hey Anthony  come on upstairs.  Johnny call  you go. So I run right upstairs. As he opens the door  he says to me   Do you want some   Now I immediately knew what he meant. Because for me growing up at that time  and our relationship with this man box   Do you want some   meant one of two things  sex or drugs    and we weren't doing drugs. Now my box  my card  my man box card  was immediately in jeopardy. Two things  One  I never had sex. We don't talk about that as men. You only tell your dearest  closest friend  sworn to secrecy for life  the first time you had sex. For everybody else  we go around like we've been having sex since we were two. There ain't no first time. The other thing I couldn't tell him is that I didn't want any. That's even worse. We're supposed to always be on the prowl. Women are objects  especially sexual objects. Anyway  so I couldn't tell him any of that. So  like my mother would say  make a long story short  I just simply said to Johnny   Yes.  He told me to go in his room. I go in his room. On his bed is a girl from the neighborhood named Sheila. She's    years old. She's nude. She's what I know today to be mentally ill  higher functioning at times than others. We had a whole choice of inappropriate names for her. Anyway  Johnny had just gotten through having sex with her. Well actually  he raped her  but he would say he had sex with her. Because  while Sheila never said no  she also never said yes. So he was offering me the opportunity to do the same. So when I go in the room  I close the door. Folks  I'm petrified. I stand with my back to the door so Johnny can't bust in the room and see that I'm not doing anything  and I stand there long enough that I could have actually done something. So now I'm no longer trying to figure out what I'm going to do  I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to get out of this room. So in my    years of wisdom  I zip my pants down  I walk out into the room  and lo and behold to me  while I was in the room with Sheila  Johnny was back at the window calling guys up. So now there's a living room full of guys. It was like the waiting room in the doctor's office. And they asked me how was it  and I say to them   It was good   and I zip my pants up in front of them  and I head for the door. Now I say this all with remorse  and I was feeling a tremendous amount of remorse at that time  but I was conflicted  because  while I was feeling remorse  I was excited  because I didn't get caught. But I knew I felt bad about what was happening. This fear  getting outside the man box  totally enveloped me. It was way more important to me  about me and my man box card than about Sheila and what was happening to her. See collectively  we as men are taught to have less value in women  to view them as property and the objects of men. We see that as an equation that equals violence against women. We as men  good men  the large majority of men  we operate on the foundation of this whole collective socialization. We kind of see ourselves separate  but we're very much a part of it. You see  we have to come to understand that less value  property and objectification is the foundation and the violence can't happen without it. So we're very much a part of the solution as well as the problem. The center for disease control says that men's violence against women is at epidemic proportions  is the number one health concern for women in this country and abroad. So quickly  I'd like to just say  this is the love of my life  my daughter Jay. The world I envision for her    how do I want men to be acting and behaving  I need you on board. I need you with me. I need you working with me and me working with you on how we raise our sons and teach them to be men    that it's okay to not be dominating  that it's okay to have feelings and emotions  that it's okay to promote equality  that it's okay to have women who are just friends and that's it  that it's okay to be whole  that my liberation as a man is tied to your liberation as a woman.  Applause  I remember asking a nine year old boy  I asked a nine year old boy   What would life be like for you  if you didn't have to adhere to this man box   He said to me   I would be free.  Thank you folks. Now I'm going to give you a story. It's an Indian story about an Indian woman and her journey. Let me begin with my parents. I'm a product of this visionary mother and father. Many years ago  when I was born in the '  s    '  s and '  s didn't belong to girls in India. They belonged to boys. They belonged to boys who would join business and inherit business from parents  and girls would be dolled up to get married. My family  in my city  and almost in the country  was unique. We were four of us  not one  and fortunately no boys. We were four girls and no boys. And my parents were part of a landed property family. My father defied his own grandfather  almost to the point of disinheritance  because he decided to educate all four of us. He sent us to one of the best schools in the city and gave us the best education. As I've said  when we're born  we don't choose our parents  and when we go to school  we don't choose our school. Children don't choose a school. They just get the school which parents choose for them. So this is the foundation time which I got. I grew up like this  and so did my other three sisters. And my father used to say at that time   I'm going to spread all my four daughters in four corners of the world.  I don't know if he really meant  that   but it happened. I'm the only one who's left in India. One is a British  another is an American and the third is a Canadian. So we are four of us in four corners of the world. And since I said they're my role models  I followed two things which my father and mother gave me. One  they said   Life is on an incline. You either go up  or you come down.  And the second thing  which has stayed with me  which became my philosophy of life  which made all the difference  is      things happen in your life  good or bad. Out of         are your creation. They're good. They're your creation. Enjoy it. If they're bad  they're your creation. Learn from it. Ten are nature sent over which you can't do a thing. It's like a death of a relative  or a cyclone  or a hurricane  or an earthquake. You can't do a thing about it. You've got to just respond to the situation. But that response comes out of those    points. Since I'm a product of this philosophy  of        and secondly   life on an incline   that's the way I grew up to be valuing what I got. I'm a product of opportunities  rare opportunities in the '  s and the '  s  which girls didn't get  and I was conscious of the fact that what my parents were giving me was something unique. Because all of my best school friends were getting dolled up to get married with a lot of dowry  and here I was with a tennis racket and going to school and doing all kinds of extracurricular activities. I thought I must tell you this. Why I said this  is the background. This is what comes next. I joined the Indian Police Service as a tough woman  a woman with indefatigable stamina  because I used to run for my tennis titles  etc. But I joined the Indian Police Service  and then it was a new pattern of policing. For me the policing stood for power to correct  power to prevent and power to detect. This is something like a new definition ever given in policing in India    the power to prevent. Because normally it was always said  power to detect  and that's it  or power to punish. But I decided no  it's a power to prevent  because that's what I learned when I was growing up. How do I prevent the    and never make it more than     So this was how it came into my service  and it was different from the men. I didn't want to make it different from the men  but it was different  because this was the way I was different. And I redefined policing concepts in India. I'm going to take you on two journeys  my policing journey and my prison journey. What you see  if you see the title called  PM's car held.  This was the first time a prime minister of India was given a parking ticket. That's the first time in India  and I can tell you  that's the last time you're hearing about it. It'll never happen again in India  because now it was once and forever. And the rule was  because I was sensitive  I was compassionate  I was very sensitive to injustice  and I was very pro justice. That's the reason  as a woman  I joined the Indian Police Service. I had other options  but I didn't choose them. So I'm going to move on. This is about tough policing  equal policing. Now I was known as  here's a woman that's not going to listen.  So I was sent to all indiscriminate postings  postings which others would say no. I now went to a prison assignment as a police officer. Normally police officers don't want to do prison. They sent me to prison to lock me up  thinking   Now there will be no cars and no VIPs to be given tickets to. Let's lock her up.  Here I got a prison assignment. This was a prison assignment which was one big den of criminals. Obviously  it was. But        men  of which only     were women                    plus about     were men. Terrorists  rapists  burglars  gangsters    some of them I'd sent to jail as a police officer outside. And then how did I deal with them  The first day when I went in  I didn't know how to look at them. And I said   Do you pray   When I looked at the group  I said   Do you pray   They saw me as a young  short woman wearing a pathan suit. I said   Do you pray   And they didn't say anything. I said   Do you pray  Do you want to pray   They said   Yes.  I said   All right  let's pray.  I prayed for them  and things started to change. This is a visual of education inside the prison. Friends  this has never happened  where everybody in the prison studies. I started this with community support. Government had no budget. It was one of the finest  largest volunteerism in any prison in the world. This was initiated in Delhi prison. You see one sample of a prisoner teaching a class. These are hundreds of classes. Nine to eleven  every prisoner went into the education program    the same den in which they thought they would put me behind the bar and things would be forgotten. We converted this into an ashram    from a prison to an ashram through education. I think that's the bigger change. It was the beginning of a change. Teachers were prisoners. Teachers were volunteers. Books came from donated schoolbooks. Stationery was donated. Everything was donated  because there was no budget of education for the prison. Now if I'd not done that  it would have been a hellhole. That's the second landmark. I want to show you some moments of history in my journey  which probably you would never ever get to see anywhere in the world. One  the numbers you'll never get to see. Secondly  this concept. This was a meditation program inside the prison of over       prisoners. One thousand prisoners who sat in meditation. This was one of the most courageous steps I took as a prison governor. And this is what transformed. You want to know more about this  go and see this film   Doing Time  Doing Vipassana.  You will hear about it  and you will love it. And write to me on KiranBedi.com  and I'll respond to you. Let me show you the next slide. I took the same concept of mindfulness  because  why did I bring meditation into the Indian prison  Because crime is a product of a distorted mind. It was distortion of mind which needed to be addressed to control. Not by preaching  not by telling  not by reading  but by addressing your mind. I took the same thing to the police  because police  equally  were prisoners of their minds  and they felt as if it was  we  and  they   and that the people don't cooperate. This worked. This is a feedback box called a petition box. This is a concept which I introduced to listen to complaints  listen to grievances. This was a magic box. This was a sensitive box. This is how a prisoner drew how they felt about the prison. If you see somebody in the blue    yeah  this guy    he was a prisoner  and he was a teacher. And you see  everybody's busy. There was no time to waste. Let me wrap it up. I'm currently into movements  movements of education of the under served children  which is thousands    India is all about thousands. Secondly is about the anti corruption movement in India. That's a big way we  as a small group of activists  have drafted an ombudsman bill for the government of India. Friends  you will hear a lot about it. That's the movement at the moment I'm driving  and that's the movement and ambition of my life. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We are now going through an amazing and unprecedented moment where the power dynamics between men and women are shifting very rapidly  and in many of the places where it counts the most  women are  in fact  taking control of everything. In my mother's day  she didn't go to college. Not a lot of women did. And now  for every two men who get a college degree  three women will do the same. Women  for the first time this year  became the majority of the American workforce. And they're starting to dominate lots of professions    doctors  lawyers  bankers  accountants. Over    percent of managers are women these days  and in the    professions projected to grow the most in the next decade  all but two of them are dominated by women. So the global economy is becoming a place where women are more successful than men  believe it or not  and these economic changes are starting to rapidly affect our culture    what our romantic comedies look like  what our marriages look like  what our dating lives look like  and our new set of superheroes. For a long time  this is the image of American manhood that dominated    tough  rugged  in control of his own environment. A few years ago  the Marlboro Man was retired and replaced by this much less impressive specimen  who is a parody of American manhood  and that's what we have in our commercials today. The phrase  first born son  is so deeply ingrained in our consciousness that this statistic alone shocked me. In American fertility clinics     percent of couples are requesting girls and not boys. And in places where you wouldn't think  such as South Korea  India and China  the very strict patriarchal societies are starting to break down a little  and families are no longer strongly preferring first born sons. If you think about this  if you just open your eyes to this possibility and start to connect the dots  you can see the evidence everywhere. You can see it in college graduation patterns  in job projections  in our marriage statistics  you can see it in the Icelandic elections  which you'll hear about later  and you can see it on South Korean surveys on son preference  that something amazing and unprecedented is happening with women. Certainly this is not the first time that we've had great progress with women. The '  s and the '  s also come to mind. But the difference is that  back then  it was driven by a very passionate feminist movement that was trying to project its own desires  whereas this time  it's not about passion  and it's not about any kind of movement. This is really just about the facts of this economic moment that we live in. The         year period in which men have been top dog is truly coming to an end  believe it or not  and that's why I talk about the  end of men.  Now all you men out there  this is not the moment where you tune out or throw some tomatoes  because the point is that this is happening to all of us. I myself have a husband and a father and two sons whom I dearly love. And this is why I like to talk about this  because if we don't acknowledge it  then the transition will be pretty painful. But if we do take account of it  then I think it will go much more smoothly. I first started thinking about this about a year and a half ago. I was reading headlines about the recession just like anyone else  and I started to notice a distinct pattern    that the recession was affecting men much more deeply than it was affecting women. And I remembered back to about    years ago when I read a book by Susan Faludi called  Stiffed  The Betrayal of the American Man   in which she described how hard the recession had hit men  and I started to think about whether it had gotten worse this time around in this recession. And I realized that two things were different this time around. The first was that these were no longer just temporary hits that the recession was giving men    that this was reflecting a deeper underlying shift in our global economy. And second  that the story was no longer just about the crisis of men  but it was also about what was happening to women. And now look at this second set of slides. These are headlines about what's been going on with women in the next few years. These are things we never could have imagined a few years ago. Women  a majority of the workplace. And labor statistics  women take up most managerial jobs. This second set of headlines    you can see that families and marriages are starting to shift. And look at that last headline    young women earning more than young men. That particular headline comes to me from a market research firm. They were basically asked by one of their clients who was going to buy houses in that neighborhood in the future. And they expected that it would be young families  or young men  just like it had always been. But in fact  they found something very surprising. It was young  single women who were the major purchasers of houses in the neighborhood. And so they decided  because they were intrigued by this finding  to do a nationwide survey. So they spread out all the census data  and what they found  the guy described to me as a shocker  which is that in       out of       communities  women  young women  were making more money than young men. So here you have a generation of young women who grow up thinking of themselves as being more powerful earners than the young men around them. Now  I've just laid out the picture for you  but I still haven't explained to you why this is happening. And in a moment  I'm going to show you a graph  and what you'll see on this graph    it begins in       just before women start flooding the workforce  and it brings us up to our current day. And basically what you'll see is what economists talk about as the polarization of the economy. Now what does that mean  It means that the economy is dividing into high skill  high wage jobs and low skill  low wage jobs    and that the middle  the middle skill jobs  and the middle earning jobs  are starting to drop out of the economy. This has been going on for    years now. But this process is affecting men very differently than it's affecting women. You'll see the women in red  and you'll see the men in blue. You'll watch them both drop out of the middle class  but see what happens to women and see what happens to men. There we go. So watch that. You see them both drop out of the middle class. Watch what happens to the women. Watch what happens to the men. The men sort of stagnate there  while the women zoom up in those high skill jobs. So what's that about  It looks like women got some power boost on a video game  or like they snuck in some secret serum into their birth control pills that lets them shoot up high. But of course  it's not about that. What it's about is that the economy has changed a lot. We used to have a manufacturing economy  which was about building goods and products  and now we have a service economy and an information and creative economy. Those two economies require very different skills  and as it happens  women have been much better at acquiring the new set of skills than men have been. It used to be that you were a guy who went to high school who didn't have a college degree  but you had a specific set of skills  and with the help of a union  you could make yourself a pretty good middle class life. But that really isn't true anymore. This new economy is pretty indifferent to size and strength  which is what's helped men along all these years. What the economy requires now is a whole different set of skills. You basically need intelligence  you need an ability to sit still and focus  to communicate openly  to be able to listen to people and to operate in a workplace that is much more fluid than it used to be  and those are things that women do extremely well  as we're seeing. If you look at management theory these days  it used to be that our ideal leader sounded something like General Patton  right  You would be issuing orders from above. You would be very hierarchical. You would tell everyone below you what to do. But that's not what an ideal leader is like now. If you read management books now  a leader is somebody who can foster creativity  who can get his    get the employees    see  I still say  his     who can get the employees to talk to each other  who can basically build teams and get them to be creative. And those are all things that women do very well. And then on top of that  that's created a kind of cascading effect. Women enter the workplace at the top  and then at the working class  all the new jobs that are created are the kinds of jobs that wives used to do for free at home. So that's childcare  elder care and food preparation. So those are all the jobs that are growing  and those are jobs that women tend to do. Now one day it might be that mothers will hire an out of work  middle aged  former steelworker guy to watch their children at home  and that would be good for the men  but that hasn't quite happened yet. To see what's going to happen  you can't just look at the workforce that is now  you have to look at our future workforce. And here the story is fairly simple. Women are getting college degrees at a faster rate than men. Why  This is a real mystery. People have asked men  why don't they just go back to college  to community college  say  and retool themselves  learn a new set of skills  Well it turns out that they're just very uncomfortable doing that. They're used to thinking of themselves as providers  and they can't seem to build the social networks that allow them to get through college. So for some reason men just don't end up going back to college. And what's even more disturbing is what's happening with younger boys. There's been about a decade of research about what people are calling the  boy crisis.  Now the boy crisis is this idea that very young boys  for whatever reason  are doing worse in school than very young girls  and people have theories about that. Is it because we have an excessively verbal curriculum  and little girls are better at that than little boys  Or that we require kids to sit still too much  and so boys initially feel like failures  And some people say it's because  in  th grade  boys start dropping out of school. Because I'm writing a book about all this  I'm still looking into it  so I don't have the answer. But in the mean time  I'm going to call on the worldwide education expert  who's my    year old daughter  Noa  to talk to you about why the boys in her class do worse. I mean they have much larger vocabulary. They learn much faster. They are more controlled. On the board today for losing recess tomorrow  only boys. Hanna Rosin  And why is that  Noa  Why  They were just not listening to the class while the girls sat there very nicely. HR  So there you go. This whole thesis really came home to me when I went to visit a college in Kansas City    working class college. Certainly  when I was in college  I had certain expectations about my life    that my husband and I would both work  and that we would equally raise the children. But these college girls had a completely different view of their future. Basically  the way they said it to me is that they would be working    hours a day  that their husband would maybe have a job  but that mostly he would be at home taking care of the kiddies. And this was kind of a shocker to me. And then here's my favorite quote from one of the girls   Men are the new ball and chain.  Now you laugh  but that quote has kind of a sting to it  right  And I think the reason it has a sting is because thousands of years of history don't reverse themselves without a lot of pain  and that's why I talk about us all going through this together. The night after I talked to these college girls  I also went to a men's group in Kansas  and these were exactly the kind of victims of the manufacturing economy which I spoke to you about earlier. They were men who had been contractors  or they had been building houses and they had lost their jobs after the housing boom  and they were in this group because they were failing to pay their child support. And the instructor was up there in the class explaining to them all the ways in which they had lost their identity in this new age. He was telling them they no longer had any moral authority  that nobody needed them for emotional support anymore  and they were not really the providers. So who were they  And this was very disheartening for them. And what he did was he wrote down on the board            and he said   That's her salary   and then he wrote down         .   That's your salary. So who's the man now   he asked them.  Who's the damn man  She's the man now.  And that really sent a shudder through the room. And that's part of the reason I like to talk about this  because I think it can be pretty painful  and we really have to work through it. And the other reason it's kind of urgent is because it's not just happening in the U.S. It's happening all over the world. In India  poor women are learning English faster than their male counterparts in order to staff the new call centers that are growing in India. In China  a lot of the opening up of private entrepreneurship is happening because women are starting businesses  small businesses  faster than men. And here's my favorite example  which is in South Korea. Over several decades  South Korea built one of the most patriarchal societies we know about. They basically enshrined the second class status of women in the civil code. And if women failed to birth male children  they were basically treated like domestic servants. And sometimes family would pray to the spirits to kill off a girl child so they could have a male child. But over the '  s and '  s  the South Korea government decided they wanted to rapidly industrialize  and so what they did was  they started to push women into the workforce. Now they've been asking a question since        How strongly do you prefer a first born son   And now look at the chart. That's from      to     . How much do you prefer a first born son  So you can see that these economic changes really do have a strong effect on our culture. Now because we haven't fully processed this information  it's kind of coming back to us in our pop culture in these kind of weird and exaggerated ways  where you can see that the stereotypes are changing. And so we have on the male side what one of my colleagues likes to call the  omega males  popping up  who are the males who are romantically challenged losers who can't find a job. And they come up in lots of different forms. So we have the perpetual adolescent. We have the charmless misanthrope. Then we have our Bud Light guy who's the happy couch potato. And then here's a shocker  even America's most sexiest man alive  the sexiest man alive gets romantically played these days in a movie. And then on the female side  you have the opposite  in which you have these crazy superhero women. You've got Lady Gaga. You've got our new James Bond  who's Angelina Jolie. And it's not just for the young  right  Even Helen Mirren can hold a gun these days. And so it feels like we have to move from this place where we've got these uber exaggerated images into something that feels a little more normal. So for a long time in the economic sphere  we've lived with the term  glass ceiling.  Now I've never really liked this term. For one thing  it puts men and women in a really antagonistic relationship with one another  because the men are these devious tricksters up there who've put up this glass ceiling. And we're always below the glass ceiling  the women. And we have a lot of skill and experience  but it's a trick  so how are you supposed to prepare to get through that glass ceiling  And also   shattering the glass ceiling  is a terrible phrase. What crazy person would pop their head through a glass ceiling  So the image that I like to think of  instead of glass ceiling  is the high bridge. It's definitely terrifying to stand at the foot of a high bridge  but it's also pretty exhilarating  because it's beautiful up there  and you're looking out on a beautiful view. And the great thing is there's no trick like with the glass ceiling. There's no man or woman standing in the middle about to cut the cables. There's no hole in the middle that you're going to fall through. And the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you. You can bring your husband along. You can bring your friends  or your colleagues  or your babysitter to walk along with you. And husbands can drag their wives across  if their wives don't feel ready. But the point about the high bridge is that you have to have the confidence to know that you deserve to be on that bridge  that you have all the skills and experience you need in order to walk across the high bridge  but you just have to make the decision to take the first step and do it. Thanks very much. I have been teaching for a long time  and in doing so have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning that I really wish more people would understand about the potential of students. In       my grandmother    bottom left for you guys over here    graduated from the eighth grade. She went to school to get the information because that's where the information lived. It was in the books  it was inside the teacher's head  and she needed to go there to get the information  because that's how you learned. Fast forward a generation  this is the one room schoolhouse  Oak Grove  where my father went to a one room schoolhouse. And he again had to travel to the school to get the information from the teacher  stored it in the only portable memory he has  which is inside his own head  and take it with him  because that is how information was being transported from teacher to student and then used in the world. When I was a kid  we had a set of encyclopedias at my house. It was purchased the year I was born  and it was extraordinary  because I did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information. The information was inside my house and it was awesome. This was different than either generation had experienced before  and it changed the way I interacted with information even at just a small level. But the information was closer to me. I could get access to it. In the time that passes between when I was a kid in high school and when I started teaching  we really see the advent of the Internet. Right about the time that the Internet gets going as an educational tool  I take off from Wisconsin and move to Kansas  small town Kansas  where I had an opportunity to teach in a lovely  small town  rural Kansas school district  where I was teaching my favorite subject  American government. My first year    super gung ho    going to teach American government  loved the political system. Kids in the   th grade  not exactly all that enthusiastic about the American government system. Year two  learned a few things    had to change my tactic. And I put in front of them an authentic experience that allowed them to learn for themselves. I didn't tell them what to do or how to do it. I posed a problem in front of them  which was to put on an election forum for their own community. They produced flyers. They called offices. They checked schedules. They were meeting with secretaries. They produced an election forum booklet for the entire town to learn more about their candidates. They invited everyone into the school for an evening of conversation about government and politics and whether or not the streets were done well  and really had this robust experiential learning. The older teachers    more experienced    looked at me and went   Oh  there she is. That's so cute. She's trying to get that done.   She doesn't know what she's in for.  But I knew that the kids would show up  and I believed it  and I told them every week what I expected out of them. And that night  all    kids    dressed appropriately  doing their job  owning it. I had to just sit and watch. It was theirs. It was experiential. It was authentic. It meant something to them. And they will step up. From Kansas  I moved on to lovely Arizona  where I taught in Flagstaff for a number of years  this time with middle school students. Luckily  I didn't have to teach them American government. Could teach them the more exciting topic of geography. Again   thrilled  to learn. But what was interesting about this position I found myself in in Arizona  was I had this really extraordinarily eclectic group of kids to work with in a truly public school  and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities. And one opportunity was we got to go and meet Paul Rusesabagina  which is the gentleman that the movie  Hotel Rwanda  is based after. And he was going to speak at the high school next door to us. We could walk there. We didn't even have to pay for the buses. There was no expense cost. Perfect field trip. The problem then becomes how do you take seventh  and eighth graders to a talk about genocide and deal with the subject in a way that is responsible and respectful  and they know what to do with it. And so we chose to look at Paul Rusesabagina as an example of a gentleman who singularly used his life to do something positive. I then challenged the kids to identify someone in their own life  or in their own story  or in their own world  that they could identify that had done a similar thing. I asked them to produce a little movie about it. It's the first time we'd done this. Nobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer  but they were into it. And I asked them to put their own voice over it. It was the most awesome moment of revelation that when you ask kids to use their own voice and ask them to speak for themselves  what they're willing to share. The last question of the assignment is  how do you plan to use your life to positively impact other people  The things that kids will say when you ask them and take the time to listen is extraordinary. Fast forward to Pennsylvania  where I find myself today. I teach at the Science Leadership Academy  which is a partnership school between the Franklin Institute and the school district of Philadelphia. We are a nine through    public school  but we do school quite differently. I moved there primarily to be part of a learning environment that validated the way that I knew that kids learned  and that really wanted to investigate what was possible when you are willing to let go of some of the paradigms of the past  of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school and when my father was in school and even when I was in school  and to a moment when we have information surplus. So what do you do when the information is all around you  Why do you have kids come to school if they no longer have to come there to get the information  In Philadelphia we have a one to one laptop program  so the kids are bringing in laptops with them everyday  taking them home  getting access to information. And here's the thing that you need to get comfortable with when you've given the tool to acquire information to students  is that you have to be comfortable with this idea of allowing kids to fail as part of the learning process. We deal right now in the educational landscape with an infatuation with the culture of one right answer that can be properly bubbled on the average multiple choice test  and I am here to share with you  it is not learning. That is the absolute wrong thing to ask  to tell kids to never be wrong. To ask them to always have the right answer doesn't allow them to learn. So we did this project  and this is one of the artifacts of the project. I almost never show them off because of the issue of the idea of failure. My students produced these info graphics as a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year responding to the oil spill. I asked them to take the examples that we were seeing of the info graphics that existed in a lot of mass media  and take a look at what were the interesting components of it  and produce one for themselves of a different man made disaster from American history. And they had certain criteria to do it. They were a little uncomfortable with it  because we'd never done this before  and they didn't know exactly how to do it. They can talk    they're very smooth  and they can write very  very well  but asking them to communicate ideas in a different way was a little uncomfortable for them. But I gave them the room to just do the thing. Go create. Go figure it out. Let's see what we can do. And the student that persistently turns out the best visual product did not disappoint. This was done in like two or three days. And this is the work of the student that consistently did it. And when I sat the students down  I said   Who's got the best one   And they immediately went   There it is.  Didn't read anything.  There it is.  And I said   Well what makes it great   And they're like   Oh  the design's good  and he's using good color. And there's some ...   And they went through all that we processed out loud. And I said   Go read it.  And they're like   Oh  that one wasn't so awesome.  And then we went to another one    it didn't have great visuals  but it had great information    and spent an hour talking about the learning process  because it wasn't about whether or not it was perfect  or whether or not it was what I could create. It asked them to create for themselves  and it allowed them to fail  process  learn from. And when we do another round of this in my class this year  they will do better this time  because learning has to include an amount of failure  because failure is instructional in the process. There are a million pictures that I could click through here  and had to choose carefully    this is one of my favorites    of students learning  of what learning can look like in a landscape where we let go of the idea that kids have to come to school to get the information  but instead  ask them what they can do with it. Ask them really interesting questions. They will not disappoint. Ask them to go to places  to see things for themselves  to actually experience the learning  to play  to inquire. This is one of my favorite photos  because this was taken on Tuesday  when I asked the students to go to the polls. This is Robbie  and this was his first day of voting  and he wanted to share that with everybody and do that. But this is learning too  because we asked them to go out into real spaces. The main point is that  if we continue to look at education as if it's about coming to school to get the information and not about experiential learning  empowering student voice and embracing failure  we're missing the mark. And everything that everybody is talking about today isn't possible if we keep having an educational system that does not value these qualities  because we won't get there with a standardized test  and we won't get there with a culture of one right answer. We know how to do this better  and it's time to do better. Alisa Volkman  So this is where our story begins    the dramatic moments of the birth of our first son  Declan. Obviously a really profound moment  and it changed our lives in many ways. It also changed our lives in many unexpected ways  and those unexpected ways we later reflected on  that eventually spawned a business idea between the two of us  and a year later  we launched Babble  a website for parents. Rufus Griscom  Now I think of our story as starting a few years earlier. AV  That's true. RG  You may remember  we fell head over heels in love. AV  We did. RG  We were at the time running a very different kind of website. It was a website called Nerve.com  the tagline of which was  literate smut.  It was in theory  and hopefully in practice  a smart online magazine about sex and culture. AV  That spawned a dating site. But you can understand the jokes that we get. Sex begets babies. You follow instructions on Nerve and you should end up on Babble  which we did. And we might launch a geriatric site as our third. We'll see. RG  But for us  the continuity between Nerve and Babble was not just the life stage thing  which is  of course  relevant  but it was really more about our desire to speak very honestly about subjects that people have difficulty speaking honestly about. It seems to us that when people start dissembling  people start lying about things  that's when it gets really interesting. That's a subject that we want to dive into. And we've been surprised to find  as young parents  that there are almost more taboos around parenting than there are around sex. AV  It's true. So like we said  the early years were really wonderful  but they were also really difficult. And we feel like some of that difficulty was because of this false advertisement around parenting. We subscribed to a lot of magazines  did our homework  but really everywhere you look around  we were surrounded by images like this. And we went into parenting expecting our lives to look like this. The sun was always streaming in  and our children would never be crying. I would always be perfectly coiffed and well rested  and in fact  it was not like that at all. RG  When we lowered the glossy parenting magazine that we were looking at  with these beautiful images  and looked at the scene in our actual living room  it looked a little bit more like this. These are our three sons. And of course  they're not always crying and screaming  but with three boys  there's a decent probability that at least one of them will not be comporting himself exactly as he should. AV  Yes  you can see where the disconnect was happening for us. We really felt like what we went in expecting had nothing to do with what we were actually experiencing  and so we decided we really wanted to give it to parents straight. We really wanted to let them understand what the realities of parenting were in an honest way. RG  So today  what we would love to do is share with you four parenting taboos. And of course  there are many more than four things you can't say about parenting  but we would like to share with you today four that are particularly relevant for us personally. So the first  taboo number one  you can't say you didn't fall in love with your baby in the very first minute. I remember vividly  sitting there in the hospital. We were in the process of giving birth to our first child. AV  We  or I  RG  I'm sorry. Misuse of the pronoun. Alisa was very generously in the process of giving birth to our first child     AV  Thank you.     and I was there with a catcher's mitt. And I was there with my arms open. The nurse was coming at me with this beautiful  beautiful child  and I remember  as she was approaching me  the voices of friends saying   The moment they put the baby in your hands  you will feel a sense of love that will come over you that is  on  an order of magnitude more powerful than anything you've ever experienced in your entire life.  So I was bracing myself for the moment. The baby was coming  and I was ready for this Mack truck of love to just knock me off my feet. And instead  when the baby was placed in my hands  it was an extraordinary moment. This picture is from literally a few seconds after the baby was placed in my hands and I brought him over. And you can see  our eyes were glistening. I was overwhelmed with love and affection for my wife  with deep  deep gratitude that we had what appeared to be a healthy child. And it was also  of course  surreal. I mean  I had to check the tags and make sure. I was incredulous   Are you sure this is our child   And this was all quite remarkable. But what I felt towards the child at that moment was deep affection  but nothing like what I feel for him now  five years later. And so we've done something here that is heretical. We have charted our love for our child over time. This  as you know  is an act of heresy. You're not allowed to chart love. The reason you're not allowed to chart love is because we think of love as a binary thing. You're either in love  or you're not in love. You love  or you don't love. And I think the reality is that love is a process  and I think the problem with thinking of love as something that's binary is that it causes us to be unduly concerned that love is fraudulent  or inadequate  or what have you. And I think I'm speaking obviously here to the father's experience. But I think a lot of men do go through this sense in the early months  maybe their first year  that their emotional response is inadequate in some fashion. AV  Well  I'm glad Rufus is bringing this up  because you can notice where he dips in the first years where I think I was doing most of the work. But we like to joke  in the first few months of all of our children's lives  this is Uncle Rufus. RG  I'm a very affectionate uncle  very affectionate uncle. AV  Yes  and I often joke with Rufus when he comes home that I'm not sure he would actually be able to find our child in a line up amongst other babies. So I actually threw a pop quiz here onto Rufus. RG  Uh oh. AV  I don't want to embarrass him too much. But I am going to give him three seconds. RG  That is not fair. This is a trick question. He's not up there  is he  AV  Our eight week old son is somewhere in here  and I want to see if Rufus can actually quickly identify him. RG  The far left. AV  No  RG  Cruel. AV  Nothing more to be said. I'll move on to taboo number two. You can't talk about how lonely having a baby can be. I enjoyed being pregnant. I loved it. I felt incredibly connected to the community around me. I felt like everyone was participating in my pregnancy  all around me  tracking it down till the actual due date. I felt like I was a vessel of the future of humanity. That continued into the the hospital. It was really exhilarating. I was shower with gifts and flowers and visitors. It was a really wonderful experience  but when I got home  I suddenly felt very disconnected and suddenly shut in and shut out  and I was really surprised by those feelings. I did expect it to be difficult  have sleepless nights  constant feedings  but I did not expect the feelings of isolation and loneliness that I experienced  and I was really surprised that no one had talked to me  that I was going to be feeling this way. And I called my sister whom I'm very close to    and had three children    and I asked her   Why didn't you tell me I was going to be feeling this way  that I was going to have these    feeling incredibly isolated   And she said    I'll never forget     It's just not something you want to say to a mother that's having a baby for the first time.  RG  And of course  we think it's precisely what you really should be saying to mothers who have kids for the first time. And that this  of course  one of the themes for us is that we think that candor and brutal honesty is critical to us collectively being great parents. And it's hard not to think that part of what leads to this sense of isolation is our modern world. So Alisa's experience is not isolated. So your    percent of mothers surveyed report feelings of loneliness. Of those     percent are most lonely when their kids are zero to five    probably really zero to two. In the process of preparing this  we looked at how some other cultures around the world deal with this period of time  because here in the Western world  less than    percent of us live near our family members  which I think is part of why this is such a tough period. So to take one example among many  in Southern India there's a practice known as jholabhari  in which the pregnant woman  when she's seven or eight months pregnant  moves in with her mother and goes through a series of rituals and ceremonies  give birth and returns home to her nuclear family several months after the child is born. And this is one of many ways that we think other cultures offset this kind of lonely period. AV  So taboo number three  you can't talk about your miscarriage    but today I'll talk about mine. So after we had Declan  we kind of recalibrated our expectations. We thought we actually could go through this again and thought we knew what we would be up against. And we were grateful that I was able to get pregnant  and I soon learned that we were having a boy  and then when I was five months  we learned that we had lost our child. This is actually the last little image we have of him. And it was obviously a very difficult time    really painful. As I was working through that mourning process  I was amazed that I didn't want to see anybody. I really wanted to crawl into a hole  and I didn't really know how I was going to work my way back into my surrounding community. And I realize  I think  the way I was feeling that way  is on a really deep gut level  I was feeling a lot of shame and embarrassed  frankly  that  in some respects  I had failed at delivering what I'm genetically engineered to do. And of course  it made me question  if I wasn't able to have another child  what would that mean for my marriage  and just me as a woman. So it was a very difficult time. As I started working through it more  I started climbing out of that hole and talking with other people. I was really amazed by all the stories that started flooding in. People I interacted with daily  worked with  was friends with  family members that I had known a long time  had never shared with me their own stories. And I just remember feeling all these stories came out of the woodwork  and I felt like I happened upon this secret society of women that I now was a part of  which was reassuring and also really concerning. And I think  miscarriage is an invisible loss. There's not really a lot of community support around it. There's really no ceremony  rituals  or rites. And I think  with a death  you have a funeral  you celebrate the life  and there's a lot of community support  and it's something women don't have with miscarriage. RG  Which is too bad because  of course  it's a very common and very traumatic experience. Fifteen to    percent of all pregnancies result in miscarriage  and I find this astounding. In a survey     percent of women said that miscarriage  they felt  was partly their fault  which is awful. And astoundingly     percent said they would hide a miscarriage from their spouse. So taboo number four  you can't say that your average happiness has declined since having a child. The party line is that every single aspect of my life has just gotten dramatically better ever since I participated in the miracle that is childbirth and family. I'll never forget  I remember vividly to this day  our first son  Declan  was nine months old  and I was sitting there on the couch  and I was reading Daniel Gilbert's wonderful book   Stumbling on Happiness.  And I got about two thirds of the way through  and there was a chart on the right hand side    on the right hand page    that we've labeled here  The Most Terrifying Chart Imaginable for a New Parent.  This chart is comprised of four completely independent studies. Basically  there's this precipitous drop of marital satisfaction  which is closely aligned  we all know  with broader happiness  that doesn't rise again until your first child goes to college. So I'm sitting here looking at the next two decades of my life  this chasm of happiness that we're driving our proverbial convertible straight into. We were despondent. AV  So you can imagine  I mean again  the first few months were difficult  but we'd come out of it  and were really shocked to see this study. So we really wanted to take a deeper look at it in hopes that we would find a silver lining. RG  And that's when it's great to be running a website for parents  because we got this incredible reporter to go and interview all the scientists who conducted these four studies. We said  something is wrong here. There's something missing from these studies. It can't possibly be that bad. So Liz Mitchell did a wonderful job with this piece  and she interviewed four scientists  and she also interviewed Daniel Gilbert  and we did indeed find a silver lining. So this is our guess as to what this baseline of average happiness arguably looks like throughout life. Average happiness is  of course  inadequate  because it doesn't speak to the moment by moment experience  and so this is what we think it looks like when you layer in moment to moment experience. And so we all remember as children  the tiniest little thing    and we see it on the faces of our children    the teeniest little thing can just rocket them to these heights of just utter adulation  and then the next teeniest little thing can cause them just to plummet to the depths of despair. And it's just extraordinary to watch  and we remember it ourselves. And then  of course  as you get older  it's almost like age is a form of lithium. As you get older  you become more stable. And part of what happens  I think  in your '  s and '  s  is you start to learn to hedge your happiness. You start to realize that  Hey  I could go to this live music event and have an utterly transforming experience that will cover my entire body with goosebumps  but it's more likely that I'll feel claustrophobic and I won't be able to get a beer. So I'm not going to go. I've got a good stereo at home. So  I'm not going to go.  So your average happiness goes up  but you lose those transcendent moments. AV  Yeah  and then you have your first child  and then you really resubmit yourself to these highs and lows    the highs being the first steps  the first smile  your child reading to you for the first time    the lows being  our house  any time from six to seven every night. But you realize you resubmit yourself to losing control in a really wonderful way  which we think provides a lot of meaning to our lives and is quite gratifying. RG  And so in effect  we trade average happiness. We trade the sort of security and safety of a certain level of contentment for these transcendent moments. So where does that leave the two of us as a family with our three little boys in the thick of all this  There's another factor in our case. We have violated yet another taboo in our own lives  and this is a bonus taboo. AV  A quick bonus taboo for you  that we should not be working together  especially with three children    and we are. RG  And we had reservations about this on the front end. Everybody knows  you should absolutely not work with your spouse. In fact  when we first went out to raise money to start Babble  the venture capitalists said   We categorically don't invest in companies founded by husbands and wives  because there's an extra point of failure. It's a bad idea. Don't do it.  And we obviously went forward. We did. We raised the money  and we're thrilled that we did  because in this phase of one's life  the incredibly scarce resource is time. And if you're really passionate about what you do every day    which we are    and you're also passionate about your relationship  this is the only way we know how to do it. And so the final question that we would ask is  can we collectively bend that happiness chart upwards  It's great that we have these transcendent moments of joy  but they're sometimes pretty quick. And so how about that average baseline of happiness  Can we move that up a little bit  AV  And we kind of feel that the happiness gap  which we talked about  is really the result of walking into parenting    and really any long term partnership for that matter    with the wrong expectations. And if you have the right expectations and expectation management  we feel like it's going to be a pretty gratifying experience. RG  And so this is what    And we think that a lot of parents  when you get in there    in our case anyway    you pack your bags for a trip to Europe  and you're really excited to go. Get out of the airplane  it turns out you're trekking in Nepal. And trekking in Nepal is an extraordinary experience  particularly if you pack your bags properly and you know what you're getting in for and you're psyched. So the point of all this for us today is not just hopefully honesty for the sake of honesty  but a hope that by being more honest and candid about these experiences  that we can all collectively bend that happiness baseline up a little bit. RG   AV  Thank you. So today I'm going to talk to you about the rise of collaborative consumption. I'm going to explain what it is and try and convince you    in just    minutes    that this isn't a flimsy idea  or a short term trend  but a powerful cultural and economic force reinventing not just what we consume  but how we consume. Now I'm going to start with a deceptively simple example. Hands up    how many of you have books  CDs  DVDs  or videos lying around your house that you probably won't use again  but you can't quite bring yourself to throw away  Can't see all the hands  but it looks like all of you  right  On our shelves at home  we have a box set of the DVD series       season six to be precise. I think it was bought for us around three years ago for a Christmas present. Now my husband  Chris  and I love this show. But let's face it  when you've watched it once maybe  or twice  you don't really want to watch it again  because you know how Jack Bauer is going to defeat the terrorists. So there it sits on our shelves obsolete to us  but with immediate latent value to someone else. Now before we go on  I have a confession to make. I lived in New York for    years  and I am a big fan of  Sex and the City.  Now I'd love to watch the first movie again as sort of a warm up to the sequel coming out next week. So how easily could I swap our unwanted copy of      for a wanted copy of  Sex and the City   Now you may have noticed there's a new sector emerging called swap trading. Now the easiest analogy for swap trading is like an online dating service for all your unwanted media. What it does is use the Internet to create an infinite marketplace to match person A's  haves  with person C's  wants   whatever they may be. The other week  I went on one of these sites  appropriately called Swaptree  and there were over        items that I could instantly swap for my copy of    .  Lo and behold  there in Reseda  CA was Rondoron who wanted swap his or her  like new  copy of  Sex and the City  for my copy of    .  So in other words  what's happening here is that Swaptree solves my carrying company's sugar rush problem  a problem the economists call  the coincidence of wants   in approximately    seconds. What's even more amazing is it will print out a postage label on the spot  because it knows the way of the item. Now there are layers of technical wonder behind sites such as Swaptree  but that's not my interest  and nor is swap trading  per se. My passion  and what I've spent the last few years dedicated to researching  is the collaborative behaviors and trust mechanics inherent in these systems. When you think about it  it would have seemed like a crazy idea  even a few years ago  that I would swap my stuff with a total stranger whose real name I didn't know and without any money changing hands. Yet    percent of trades on Swaptree happen successfully  and the one percent that receive a negative rating  it's for relatively minor reasons  like the item didn't arrive on time. So what's happening here  An extremely powerful dynamic that has huge commercial and cultural implications is at play. Namely  that technology is enabling trust between strangers. We now live in a global village where we can mimic the ties that used to happen face to face  but on a scale and in ways that have never been possible before. So what's actually happening is that social networks and real time technologies are taking us back. We're bartering  trading  swapping  sharing  but they're being reinvented into dynamic and appealing forms. What I find fascinating is that we've actually wired our world to share  whether that's our neighborhood  our school  our office  or our Facebook network  and that's creating an economy of  what's mine is yours.  From the mighty eBay  the grandfather of exchange marketplaces  to car sharing companies such as GoGet  where you pay a monthly fee to rent cars by the hour  to social lending platforms such as Zopa  that will take anyone in this audience with     dollars to lend  and match them with a borrower anywhere in the world  we're sharing and collaborating again in ways that I believe are more hip than hippie. I call this  groundswell collaborative consumption.  Now before I dig into the different systems of collaborative consumption  I'd like to try and answer the question that every author rightfully gets asked  which is  where did this idea come from  Now I'd like to say I woke up one morning and said   I'm going to write about collaborative consumption   but actually it was a complicated web of seemingly disconnected ideas. Over the next minute  you're going to see a bit like a conceptual fireworks display of all the dots that went on in my head. The first thing I began to notice  how many big concepts were emerging    from the wisdom of crowds to smart mobs    around how ridiculously easy it is to form groups for a purpose. And linked to this crowd mania were examples all around the world    from the election of a president to the infamous Wikipedia  and everything in between    on what the power of numbers could achieve. Now  you know when you learn a new word  and then you start to see that word everywhere  That's what happened to me when I noticed that we are moving from passive consumers to creators  to highly enabled collaborators. What's happening is the Internet is removing the middleman  so that anyone from a T shirt designer to a knitter can make a living selling peer to peer. And the ubiquitous force of this peer to peer revolution means that sharing is happening at phenomenal rates. I mean  it's amazing to think that  in every single minute of this speech     hours of YouTube video will be loaded. Now what I find fascinating about these examples is how they're actually tapping into our primate instincts. I mean  we're monkeys  and we're born and bred to share and cooperate. And we were doing so for thousands of years  whether it's when we hunted in packs  or farmed in cooperatives  before this big system called hyper consumption came along and we built these fences and created out own little fiefdoms. But things are changing  and one of the reasons why is the digital natives  or Gen Y. They're growing up sharing    files  video games  knowledge. It's second nature to them. So we  the millennials    I am just a millennial    are like foot soldiers  moving us from a culture of  me  to a culture of  we.  The reason why it's happening so fast is because of mobile collaboration. We now live in a connected age where we can locate anyone  anytime  in real time  from a small device in our hands. All of this was going through my head towards the end of       when  of course  the great financial crash happened. Thomas Friedman is one of my favorite New York Times columnists  and he poignantly commented that      is when we hit a wall  when Mother Nature and the market both said   No more.  Now we rationally know that an economy built on hyper consumption is a Ponzi scheme. It's a house of cards. Yet  it's hard for us to individually know what to do. So all of this is a lot of twittering  right  Well it was a lot of noise and complexity in my head  until actually I realized it was happening because of four key drivers. One  a renewed belief in the importance of community  and a very redefinition of what friend and neighbor really means. A torrent of peer to peer social networks and real time technologies  fundamentally changing the way we behave. Three  pressing unresolved environmental concerns. And four  a global recession that has fundamentally shocked consumer behaviors. These four drivers are fusing together and creating the big shift    away from the   th century  defined by hyper consumption  towards the   st century  defined by collaborative consumption. I generally believe we're at an inflection point where the sharing behaviors    through sites such as Flickr and Twitter that are becoming second nature online    are being applied to offline areas of our everyday lives. From morning commutes to the way fashion is designed to the way we grow food  we are consuming and collaborating once again. So my co author  Roo Rogers  and I have actually gathered thousands of examples from all around the world of collaborative consumption. And although they vary enormously in scale  maturity and purpose  when we dived into them  we realized that they could actually be organized into three clear systems. The first is redistribution markets. Redistribution markets  just like Swaptree  are when you take a used  or pre owned  item and move it from where it's not needed to somewhere  or someone  where it is. They're increasingly thought of as the fifth 'R'    reduce  reuse  recycle  repair and redistribute    because they stretch the life cycle of a product and thereby reduce waste. The second is collaborative lifestyles. This is the sharing of resources of things like money  skills and time. I bet  in a couple of years  that phrases like  coworking  and  couchsurfing  and  time banks  are going to become a part of everyday vernacular. One of my favorite examples of collaborative lifestyles is called Landshare. It's a scheme in the U.K. that matches Mr. Jones  with some spare space in his back garden  with Mrs. Smith  a would be grower. Together they grow their own food. It's one of those ideas that's so simple  yet brilliant  you wonder why it's never been done before. Now  the third system is product service systems. This is where you pay for the benefit of the product    what it does for you    without needing to own the product outright. This idea is particularly powerful for things that have high idling capacity. And that can be anything from baby goods to fashions to    how many of you have a power drill  own a power drill  Right. That power drill will be used around    to    minutes in its entire lifetime. It's kind of ridiculous  right  Because what you need is the hole  not the drill. So why don't you rent the drill  or  even better  rent out your own drill to other people and make some money from it  These three systems are coming together  allowing people to share resources without sacrificing their lifestyles  or their cherished personal freedoms. I'm not asking people to share nicely in the sandpit. So I want to just give you an example of how powerful collaborative consumption can be to change behaviors. The average car costs       dollars a year to run. Yet  that car sits idle for    hours a day. So when you consider these two facts  it starts to make a little less sense that we have to own one outright. So this is where car sharing companies such as Zipcar and GoGet come in. In       Zipcar took     participants from across    cities    and they're all self confessed car addicts and car sharing rookies    and got them to surrender their keys for a month. Instead  these people had to walk  bike  take the train  or other forms of public transport. They could only use their Zipcar membership when absolutely necessary. The results of this challenge after just one month was staggering. It's amazing that     lbs were lost just from the extra exercise. But my favorite statistic is that     out of the     participants did not want their keys back. In other words  the car addicts had lost their urge to own. Now products service systems have been around for years. Just think of libraries and laundrettes. But I think they're entering a new age  because technology makes sharing frictionless and fun. There's a great quote that was written in the New York Times that said   Sharing is to ownership what the iPod is to the   track  what solar power is to the coal mine.  I believe also  our generation  our relationship to satisfying what we want is far less tangible than any other previous generation. I don't want the DVD  I want the movie it carries. I don't want a clunky answering machine  I want the message it saves. I don't want a CD  I want the music it plays. In other words  I don't want stuff  I want the needs or experiences it fulfills. This is fueling a massive shift from where usage trumps possessions    or as Kevin Kelly  the editor of Wired magazine  puts it   where access is better than ownership.  Now as our possessions dematerialize into the cloud  a blurry line is appearing between what's mine  what's yours  and what's ours. I want to give you one example that shows how fast this evolution is happening. This represents an eight year time span. We've gone from traditional car ownership to car sharing companies  such as Zipcar and GoGet  to ride sharing platforms that match rides to the newest entry  which is peer to peer car rental  where you can actually make money out of renting that car that sits idle for    hours a day to your neighbor. Now all of these systems require a degree of trust  and the cornerstone to this working is reputation. Now in the old consumer system  our reputation didn't matter so much  because our credit history was far more important that any kind of peer to peer review. But now with the Web  we leave a trail. With every spammer we flag  with every idea we post  comment we share  we're actually signaling how well we collaborate  and whether we can or can't be trusted. Let's go back to my first example  Swaptree. I can see that Rondoron has completed     trades with a     percent success rate. In other words  I can trust him or her. Now mark my words  it's only a matter of time before we're going to be able to perform a Google like search and see a cumulative picture of our reputation capital. And this reputation capital will determine our access to collaborative consumption. It's a new social currency  so to speak  that could become as powerful as our credit rating. Now as a closing thought  I believe we're actually in a period where we're waking up from this humongous hangover of emptiness and waste  and we're taking a leap to create a more sustainable system built to serve our innate needs for community and individual identity. I believe it will be referred to as a revolution  so to speak    when society  faced with great challenges  made a seismic shift from individual getting and spending towards a rediscovery of collective good. I'm on a mission to make sharing cool. I'm on a mission to make sharing hip. Because I really believe it can disrupt outdated modes of business  help us leapfrog over wasteful forms of hyper consumption and teach us when enough really is enough. Thank you very much. Beverly Joubert  We are truly passionate about the African wilderness and protecting the African wilderness  and so what we've done is we've focused on iconic cats. And I know  in the light of human suffering and poverty and even climate change  one would wonder  why worry about a few cats  Well today we're here to share with you a message that we have learned from a very important and special character    this leopard. Dereck Joubert  Well  our lives have basically been like a super long episode of  CSI     something like    years. In essence  what we've done is we've studied the science  we've looked at the behavior  we've seen over       kills by these amazing animals. But one of the things that science really lets us down on is that personality  that individual personality that these animals have. And here's a prime example. We found this leopard in a       year old baobab tree in Africa  the same tree that we found her mother in and her grandmother. And she took us on a journey and revealed something very special to us    her own daughter  eight days old. And the minute we found this leopard  we realized that we needed to move in  and so we basically stayed with this leopard for the next four and a half years    following her every day  getting to know her  that individual personality of hers  and really coming to know her. Now I'm destined to spend a lot of time with some unique  very  very special  individualistic and often seductive female characters. Beverly's clearly one of them  and this little leopard  Legadema  is another  and she changed our lives. BJ  Well we certainly did spend a lot of time with her    in fact  more time than even her mother did. When her mother would go off hunting  we would stay and film. And early on  a lightning bolt hit a tree    paces away from us. It was frightening  and it showered us with leaves and a pungent smell. And of course  we were stunned for a while  but when we managed to get our wits about us  we looked at it and said   My gosh  what's going to happen with that little cub  She's probably going to forever associate that deafening crash with us.  Well  we needn't have worried. She came charging out of the thicket straight towards us  sat next to us  shivering  with her back towards Dereck  and looking out. And actually from that day on  she's been comfortable with us. So we felt that that day was the day that she really earned her name. We called her Legadema  which means   light from the sky.  DJ  Now we've found these individualisms in all sorts of animals  in particular in the cats. This particular one is called Eetwidomayloh   he who greets with fire   and you can just see that about him  you know    that's his character. But only by getting up close to these animals and spending time with them can we actually even reach out and dig out these personal characters that they have. BJ  But through our investigation  we have to seek the wildest places in Africa. And right now this is in the Okavango Delta in Botswana. Yes  it is swamp. We live in the swamp in a tent  but I must tell you  every day is exhilarating. But also  our hearts are in our throats a huge amount of the time  because we're driving through water  and it's an unknown territory. But we're really there seeking and searching and filming the iconic cats. DJ  Now one of the big things  of course  everybody knows that cats hate water  and so this was a real revelation for us. And we could only find this by pushing ourselves  by going where no sane person should go    not without some prompting  by the way  from Beverly    and just pushing the envelope  going out there  pushing our vehicle  pushing ourselves. But we've managed to find that these lions are    percent bigger than any others  and they specialize in hunting buffalo in the water. BJ  And then of course  the challenge is knowing when to turn around. We don't always get that right  and on this particular day  we seriously underestimated the depth. We got deeper and deeper  until it was at Dereck's chest height. Well then we hit a deep depression  and we seriously submerged the vehicle. We actually managed to drown two million dollars' worth of camera gear. We drowned our pride  I must tell you  which was really serious  and we seized the engine. DJ  And of course  one of the rules that we have in the vehicle is that he who drowns the vehicle gets to swim with the crocodiles. You will notice also that all of these images here are taken from the top angle by Beverly    the dry top angle  by the way. But all the places we get stuck in really have great views. And it wasn't a moment  and these lions came back towards us  and Beverly was able to get a great photograph. BJ  But we truly do spend day and night trying to capture unique footage. And    years ago  we did a film called  Eternal Enemies  where we managed to capture this unusual disturbing behavior across two species    lions and hyenas. And surprisingly  it became a cult film. And we can only work that out as people were seeing parallels between the thuggish side of nature and gang warfare. DJ  It was amazing  because you can see that this lion is doing exactly what his name  Eetwidomayloh  represents. He's focused on this hyena  and he is going to get it. But that's  I think  what this is all about  is that these individuals have these personalities and characters. But for us to get them  not only do we push ourselves  but we live by certain rules of engagement  which mean we can't interfere. This sort of behavior has been going on for three  four  five million years  and we can't step in and say   That's wrong  and that's right.  But that's not always easy for us. BJ  So  as Dereck says  we have to work through extremes    extreme temperatures  push ourselves at night. Sleep deprivation is extreme. We're on the edge through a large part of the time. But  for    years  we tried to capture lions and elephants together    and never ever managed until this particular night. And I have to tell you that it was a disturbing night for me. I had tears rolling down my cheeks. I was shaking with anxiety  but I knew that  I had  to capture something that had never been seen before  had never been documented. And I do believe you should stay with us. DJ  The amazing thing about these moments    and this is probably a highlight of our career    is that you never know how it's going to end. Many people believe  in fact  that death begins in the eyes  not in the heart  not in the lungs  and that's when people give up hope  or when any life form gives up hope. And you can see the start of it here. This elephant  against overwhelming odds  simply gives up hope. But by the same token  you can get your hope back again. So just when you think it's all over  something else happens  some spark gets into you  some sort of will to fight    that iron will that we all have  that this elephant has  that conservation has  that big cats have. Everything has that will to survive  to fight  to push through that mental barrier and to keep going. And for us  in many ways  this elephant has become a symbol of inspiration for us  a symbol of that hope as we go forward in our work. Now back to the leopard. We were spending so much time with this leopard and getting to understand her individualism  her personal character  that maybe we were taking it a little bit far. We were perhaps taking her for granted  and maybe she didn't like that that much. This is about couples working together  and so I do need to say that within the vehicle we have quite strict territories  Beverly and I. Beverly sits on the one side where all her camera gear is  and I'm on the other side where my space is. These are precious to us  these divides. BJ  But when this little cub saw that I had vacated my seat and climbed to the back to get some camera gear  she came in like a curious cat to come and investigate. It was phenomenal  and we felt grateful that she trusted us to that extent. But at the same time  we were concerned that if she created this as a habit and jumped into somebody else's car  it might not turn out the same way    she might get shot for that. So we knew we had to react quickly. And the only way we thought we could without scaring her is to try and simulate a growl like her mother would make    a hiss and a sound. So Dereck turned on the heater fan in the car    very innovative. DJ  It was the only way for me to save the marriage  because Beverly felt she was being replaced  you see. But really and truly  this was how this little leopard was displaying her individual personality. But nothing prepared us for what happened next in our relationship with her  when she started hunting. BJ  And on this first hunt  we truly were excited. It was like watching a graduation ceremony. We felt like we were surrogate parents. And of course  we knew now that she was going to survive. But only when we saw the tiny baby baboon clinging to the mother's fur did we realize that something very unique was taking place here with Legadema. And of course  the baby baboon was so innocent  it didn't turn and run. So what we watched over the next couple of hours was very unique. It was absolutely amazing when she picked it up to safety  protecting it from the hyena. And over the next five hours  she took care of it. We realized that we actually don't know everything  and that nature is so unpredictable  we have to be open at all times. DJ  Okay  so she was a little bit rough. But in fact  what we were seeing here was interesting. Because she is a cub wanting to play  but she was also a predator needing to kill  and yet conflicted in some way  because she was also an emerging mother. She had this maternal instinct  much like a young girl on her way to womanhood  and so this really took us to this new level of understanding that personality. BJ  And of course  through the night  they lay together. They ended up sleeping for hours. But I have to tell you    everybody always asks   What happened to the baby baboon   It did die  and we suspect it was from the freezing winter nights. DJ  So at this stage  I guess  we had very  very firm ideas on what conservation meant. We had to deal with these individual personalities. We had to deal with them with respect and celebrate them. And so we  with the National Geographic  formed the Big Cats Initiative to march forward into conservation  taking care of the big cats that we loved    and then had an opportunity to look back over the last    years to see how well we had all collectively been doing. So when Beverly and I were born  there were         lions  and today there are       . Tigers haven't fared any better           down to maybe      . BJ  And then cheetahs have crashed all the way down to       . Leopards have plummeted from         down to a mere       . Now in the extraordinary time that we have worked with Legadema    which is really over a five year period           leopards were legally shot by safari hunters. And that's not the only leopards that were being killed through that period. There's an immense amount of poaching as well  and so possibly the same amount. It's simply not sustainable. We admire them  and we fear them  and yet  as man  we want to steal their power. It used to be the time where only kings wore a leopard skin  but now throughout rituals and ceremonies  traditional healers and ministers. And of course  looking at this lion paw that has been skinned  it eerily reminds me of a human hand  and that's ironic  because their fate is in our hands. DJ  There's a burgeoning bone trade. South Africa just released some lion bones onto the market. Lion bones and tiger bones look exactly the same  and so in a stroke  the lion bone industry is going to wipe out all the tigers. So we have a real problem here  no more so than the lions do  the male lions. So the        lion figure that you just saw is actually a red herring  because there may be       or       male lions  and they all are actually infected with the same disease. I call it complacency    our complacency. Because there's a sport  there's an activity going on that we're all aware of  that we condone. And that's probably because we haven't seen it like we are today. BJ  And you have to know that  when a male lion is killed  it completely disrupts the whole pride. A new male comes into the area and takes over the pride  and  of course  first of all kills all the cubs and possibly some of the females that are defending their cubs. So we've estimated that between     and     lions are killed when one lion is hanging on a wall somewhere in a far off place. DJ  So what our investigations have shown is that these lions are essential. They're essential to the habitat. If they disappear  whole ecosystems in Africa disappear. There's an    billion dollar a year ecotourism revenue stream into Africa. So this is not just a concern about lions  it's a concern about communities in Africa as well. If they disappear  all of that goes away. But what I'm more concerned about in many ways is that  as we de link ourselves from nature  as we de link ourselves spiritually from these animals  we lose hope  we lose that spiritual connection  our dignity  that thing within us that keeps us connected to the planet. BJ  So you have to know  looking into the eyes of lions and leopards right now  it is all about critical awareness. And so what we are doing  in February  we're bringing out a film called  The Last Lion   and  The Last Lion  is exactly what is happening right now. That is the situation we're in    the last lions. That is  if we don't take action and do something  these plains will be completely devoid of big cats  and then  in turn  everything else will disappear. And simply  if we can't protect them  we're going to have a job protecting ourselves as well. DJ  And in fact  that original thing that we spoke about and designed our lives by    that conservation was all about respect and celebration    is probably true. That's really what it needs. We need it. We respect and celebrate each other as a man and a woman  as a community and as part of this planet  and we need to continue that. And Legadema  Well we can report  in fact  that we're grandparents. BJ DJ  Thank you very much. So for any of us in this room today  let's start out by admitting we're lucky. We don't live in the world our mothers lived in  our grandmothers lived in  where career choices for women were so limited. And if you're in this room today  most of us grew up in a world where we have basic civil rights  and amazingly  we still live in a world where some women don't have them. But all that aside  we still have a problem  and it's a real problem. And the problem is this  Women are not making it to the top of any profession anywhere in the world. The numbers tell the story quite clearly.     heads of state    nine are women. Of all the people in parliament in the world     percent are women. In the corporate sector  women at the top  C level jobs  board seats    tops out at        percent. The numbers have not moved since      and are going in the wrong direction. And even in the non profit world  a world we sometimes think of as being led by more women  women at the top     percent. We also have another problem  which is that women face harder choices between professional success and personal fulfillment. A recent study in the U.S. showed that  of married senior managers  two thirds of the married men had children and only one third of the married women had children. A couple of years ago  I was in New York  and I was pitching a deal  and I was in one of those fancy New York private equity offices you can picture. And I'm in the meeting    it's about a three hour meeting    and two hours in  there needs to be that bio break  and everyone stands up  and the partner running the meeting starts looking really embarrassed. And I realized he doesn't know where the women's room is in his office. So I start looking around for moving boxes  figuring they just moved in  but I don't see any. And so I said   Did you just move into this office   And he said   No  we've been here about a year.  And I said   Are you telling me that I am the only woman to have pitched a deal in this office in a year   And he looked at me  and he said   Yeah. Or maybe you're the only one who had to go to the bathroom.  So the question is  how are we going to fix this  How do we change these numbers at the top  How do we make this different  I want to start out by saying  I talk about this    about keeping women in the workforce    because I really think that's the answer. In the high income part of our workforce  in the people who end up at the top    Fortune     CEO jobs  or the equivalent in other industries    the problem  I am convinced  is that women are dropping out. Now people talk about this a lot  and they talk about things like flextime and mentoring and programs companies should have to train women. I want to talk about none of that today  even though that's all really important. Today I want to focus on what we can do as individuals. What are the messages we need to tell ourselves  What are the messages we tell the women that work with and for us  What are the messages we tell our daughters  Now  at the outset  I want to be very clear that this speech comes with no judgments. I don't have the right answer. I don't even have it for myself. I left San Francisco  where I live  on Monday  and I was getting on the plane for this conference. And my daughter  who's three  when I dropped her off at preschool  did that whole hugging the leg  crying   Mommy  don't get on the plane  thing. This is hard. I feel guilty sometimes. I know no women  whether they're at home or whether they're in the workforce  who don't feel that sometimes. So I'm not saying that staying in the workforce is the right thing for everyone. My talk today is about what the messages are if you do want to stay in the workforce  and I think there are three. One  sit at the table. Two  make your partner a real partner. And three  don't leave before you leave. Number one  sit at the table. Just a couple weeks ago at Facebook  we hosted a very senior government official  and he came in to meet with senior execs from around Silicon Valley. And everyone kind of sat at the table. He had these two women who were traveling with him pretty senior in his department  and I kind of said to them   Sit at the table. Come on  sit at the table   and they sat on the side of the room. When I was in college  my senior year  I took a course called European Intellectual History. Don't you love that kind of thing from college  I wish I could do that now. And I took it with my roommate  Carrie  who was then a brilliant literary student    and went on to be a brilliant literary scholar    and my brother    smart guy  but a water polo playing pre med  who was a sophomore. The three of us take this class together. And then Carrie reads all the books in the original Greek and Latin  goes to all the lectures. I read all the books in English and go to most of the lectures. My brother is kind of busy. He reads one book of    and goes to a couple of lectures  marches himself up to our room a couple days before the exam to get himself tutored. The three of us go to the exam together  and we sit down. And we sit there for three hours    and our little blue notebooks    yes  I'm that old. We walk out  we look at each other  and we say   How did you do   And Carrie says   Boy  I feel like I didn't really draw out the main point on the Hegelian dialectic.  And I say   God  I really wish I had really connected John Locke's theory of property with the philosophers that follow.  And my brother says   I got the top grade in the class.   You got the top grade in the class  You don't know anything.  The problem with these stories is that they show what the data shows  women systematically underestimate their own abilities. If you test men and women  and you ask them questions on totally objective criteria like GPAs  men get it wrong slightly high  and women get it wrong slightly low. Women do not negotiate for themselves in the workforce. A study in the last two years of people entering the workforce out of college showed that    percent of boys entering  or men  I guess  are negotiating their first salary  and only seven percent of women. And most importantly  men attribute their success to themselves  and women attribute it to other external factors. If you ask men why they did a good job  they'll say   I'm awesome. Obviously. Why are you even asking   If you ask women why they did a good job  what they'll say is someone helped them  they got lucky  they worked really hard. Why does this matter  Boy  it matters a lot. Because no one gets to the corner office by sitting on the side  not at the table  and no one gets the promotion if they don't think they deserve their success  or they don't even understand their own success. I wish the answer were easy. I wish I could go tell all the young women I work for  these fabulous women   Believe in yourself and negotiate for yourself. Own your own success.  I wish I could tell that to my daughter. But it's not that simple. Because what the data shows  above all else  is one thing  which is that success and likeability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for women. And everyone's nodding  because we all know this to be true. There's a really good study that shows this really well. There's a famous Harvard Business School study on a woman named Heidi Roizen. And she's an operator in a company in Silicon Valley  and she uses her contacts to become a very successful venture capitalist. In         not so long ago    a professor who was then at Columbia University took that case and made it  Howard  Roizen. And he gave the case out  both of them  to two groups of students. He changed exactly one word   Heidi  to  Howard.  But that one word made a really big difference. He then surveyed the students  and the good news was the students  both men and women  thought Heidi and Howard were equally competent  and that's good. The bad news was that everyone liked Howard. He's a great guy. You want to work for him. You want to spend the day fishing with him. But Heidi  Not so sure. She's a little out for herself. She's a little political. You're not sure you'd want to work for her. This is the complication. We have to tell our daughters and our colleagues  we have to tell ourselves to believe we got the A  to reach for the promotion  to sit at the table  and we have to do it in a world where  for them  there are sacrifices they will make for that  even though for their brothers  there are not. The saddest thing about all of this is that it's really hard to remember this. And I'm about to tell a story which is truly embarrassing for me  but I think important. I gave this talk at Facebook not so long ago to about     employees  and a couple hours later  there was a young woman who works there sitting outside my little desk  and she wanted to talk to me. I said  okay  and she sat down  and we talked. And she said   I learned something today. I learned that I need to keep my hand up.   What do you mean   She said   You're giving this talk  and you said you would take two more questions. I had my hand up with many other people  and you took two more questions. I put my hand down  and I noticed all the women did the same  and then you took more questions  only from the men.  And I thought to myself   Wow  if it's me    who cares about this  obviously    giving this talk    and during this talk  I can't even notice that the men's hands are still raised  and the women's hands are still raised  how good are we as managers of our companies and our organizations at seeing that the men are reaching for opportunities more than women   We've got to get women to sit at the table. Message number two  Make your partner a real partner. I've become convinced that we've made more progress in the workforce than we have in the home. The data shows this very clearly. If a woman and a man work full time and have a child  the woman does twice the amount of housework the man does  and the woman does three times the amount of childcare the man does. So she's got three jobs or two jobs  and he's got one. Who do you think drops out when someone needs to be home more  The causes of this are really complicated  and I don't have time to go into them. And I don't think Sunday football watching and general laziness is the cause. I think the cause is more complicated. I think  as a society  we put more pressure on our boys to succeed than we do on our girls. I know men that stay home and work in the home to support wives with careers  and it's hard. When I go to the Mommy and Me stuff and I see the father there  I notice that the other mommies don't play with him. And that's a problem  because we have to make it as important a job  because it's the hardest job in the world to work inside the home  for people of both genders  if we're going to even things out and let women stay in the workforce. Studies show that households with equal earning and equal responsibility also have half the divorce rate. And if that wasn't good enough motivation for everyone out there  they also have more    how shall I say this on this stage  They know each other more in the biblical sense as well. Message number three  Don't leave before you leave. I think there's a really deep irony to the fact that actions women are taking    and I see this all the time    with the objective of staying in the workforce actually lead to their eventually leaving. Here's what happens  We're all busy. Everyone's busy. A woman's busy. And she starts thinking about having a child  and from the moment she starts thinking about having a child  she starts thinking about making room for that child.  How am I going to fit this into everything else I'm doing   And literally from that moment  she doesn't raise her hand anymore  she doesn't look for a promotion  she doesn't take on the new project  she doesn't say   Me. I want to do that.  She starts leaning back. The problem is that    let's say she got pregnant that day  that day    nine months of pregnancy  three months of maternity leave  six months to catch your breath    Fast forward two years  more often    and as I've seen it    women start thinking about this way earlier    when they get engaged  or married  when they start thinking about having a child  which can take a long time. One woman came to see me about this. She looked a little young. And I said   So are you and your husband thinking about having a baby   And she said   Oh no  I'm not married.  She didn't even have a boyfriend. I said   You're thinking about this just way too early.  But the point is that what happens once you start kind of quietly leaning back  Everyone who's been through this    and I'm here to tell you  once you have a child at home  your job better be really good to go back  because it's hard to leave that kid at home. Your job needs to be challenging. It needs to be rewarding. You need to feel like you're making a difference. And if two years ago you didn't take a promotion and some guy next to you did  if three years ago you stopped looking for new opportunities  you're going to be bored because you should have kept your foot on the gas pedal. Don't leave before you leave. Stay in. Keep your foot on the gas pedal  until the very day you need to leave to take a break for a child    and then make your decisions. Don't make decisions too far in advance  particularly ones you're not even conscious you're making. My generation really  sadly  is not going to change the numbers at the top. They're just not moving. We are not going to get to where    percent of the population    in my generation  there will not be    percent of  women  at the top of any industry. But I'm hopeful that future generations can. I think a world where half of our countries and our companies were run by women  would be a better world. It's not just because people would know where the women's bathrooms are  even though that would be very helpful. I think it would be a better world. I have two children. I have a five year old son and a two year old daughter. I want my son to have a choice to contribute fully in the workforce or at home  and I want my daughter to have the choice to not just succeed  but to be liked for her accomplishments. Thank you. So today  I'm going to tell you about some people who didn't move out of their neighborhoods. The first one is happening right here in Chicago. Brenda Palms Farber was hired to help ex convicts reenter society and keep them from going back into prison. Currently  taxpayers spend about        dollars per year sending a person to jail. We know that two thirds of them are going to go back. I find it interesting that  for every one dollar we spend  however  on early childhood education  like Head Start  we save    dollars on stuff like incarceration in the future. Or    think about it    that        dollars is more than what it costs to send one person to Harvard as well. But Brenda  not being phased by stuff like that  took a look at her challenge and came up with a not so obvious solution  create a business that produces skin care products from honey. Okay  it might be obvious to some of you  it wasn't to me. It's the basis of growing a form of social innovation that has real potential. She hired seemingly unemployable men and women to care for the bees  harvest the honey and make value added products that they marketed themselves  and that were later sold at Whole Foods. She combined employment experience and training with life skills they needed  like anger management and teamwork  and also how to talk to future employers about how their experiences actually demonstrated the lessons that they had learned and their eagerness to learn more. Less than four percent of the folks that went through her program actually go back to jail. So these young men and women learned job readiness and life skills through bee keeping and became productive citizens in the process. Talk about a sweet beginning. Now  I'm going to take you to Los Angeles  and lots of people know that L.A. has its issues. But I'm going to talk about L.A.'s water issues right now. They have not enough water on most days and too much to handle when it rains. Currently     percent of California's energy consumption is used to pump water into mostly Southern California. Their spending loads  loads  to channel that rainwater out into the ocean when it rains and floods as well. Now Andy Lipkis is working to help L.A. cut infrastructure costs associated with water management and urban heat island    linking trees  people and technology to create a more livable city. All that green stuff actually naturally absorbs storm water  also helps cool our cities. Because  come to think about it  do you really want air conditioning  or is it a cooler room that you want  How you get it shouldn't make that much of a difference. So a few years ago  L.A. County decided that they needed to spend  .  billion dollars to repair the city schools. And Andy and his team discovered that they were going to spend     million of those dollars on asphalt to surround the schools themselves. And by presenting a really strong economic case  they convinced the L.A. government that replacing that asphalt with trees and other greenery  that the schools themselves would save the system more on energy than they spend on horticultural infrastructure. So ultimately     million square feet of asphalt was replaced or avoided  and electrical consumption for air conditioning went down  while employment for people to maintain those grounds went up  resulting in a net savings to the system  but also healthier students and schools system employees as well. Now Judy Bonds is a coal miner's daughter. Her family has eight generations in a town called Whitesville  West Virginia. And if anyone should be clinging to the former glory of the coal mining history  and of the town  it should be Judy. But the way coal is mined right now is different from the deep mines that her father and her father's father would go down into and that employed essentially thousands and thousands of people. Now  two dozen men can tear down a mountain in several months  and only for about a few years' worth of coal. That kind of technology is called  mountaintop removal.  It can make a mountain go from this to this in a few short months. Just imagine that the air surrounding these places    it's filled with the residue of explosives and coal. When we visited  it gave some of the people we were with this strange little cough after being only there for just a few hours or so    not just miners  but everybody. And Judy saw her landscape being destroyed and her water poisoned. And the coal companies just move on after the mountain was emptied  leaving even more unemployment in their wake. But she also saw the difference in potential wind energy on an intact mountain  and one that was reduced in elevation by over       feet. Three years of dirty energy with not many jobs  or centuries of clean energy with the potential for developing expertise and improvements in efficiency based on technical skills  and developing local knowledge about how to get the most out of that region's wind. She calculated the up front cost and the payback over time  and it's a net plus on so many levels for the local  national and global economy. It's a longer payback than mountaintop removal  but the wind energy actually pays back forever. Now mountaintop removal pays very little money to the locals  and it gives them a lot of misery. The water is turned into goo. Most people are still unemployed  leading to most of the same kinds of social problems that unemployed people in inner cities also experience    drug and alcohol abuse  domestic abuse  teen pregnancy and poor heath  as well. Now Judy and I    I have to say    totally related to each other. Not quite an obvious alliance. I mean  literally  her hometown is called Whitesville  West Virginia. I mean  they are not    they ain't competing for the birthplace of hip hop title or anything like that. But the back of my T shirt  the one that she gave me  says   Save the endangered hillbillies.  So homegirls and hillbillies we got it together and totally understand that this is what it's all about. But just a few months ago  Judy was diagnosed with stage three lung cancer. Yeah. And it has since moved to her bones and her brain. And I just find it so bizarre that she's suffering from the same thing that she tried so hard to protect people from. But her dream of Coal River Mountain Wind is her legacy. And she might not get to see that mountaintop. But rather than writing yet some kind of manifesto or something  she's leaving behind a business plan to make it happen. That's what my homegirl is doing. So I'm so proud of that. But these three people don't know each other  but they do have an awful lot in common. They're all problem solvers  and they're just some of the many examples that I really am privileged to see  meet and learn from in the examples of the work that I do now. I was really lucky to have them all featured on my Corporation for Public Radio radio show called ThePromisedLand.org. Now they're all very practical visionaries. They take a look at the demands that are out there    beauty products  healthy schools  electricity    and how the money's flowing to meet those demands. And when the cheapest solutions involve reducing the number of jobs  you're left with unemployed people  and those people aren't cheap. In fact  they make up some of what I call the most expensive citizens  and they include generationally impoverished  traumatized vets returning from the Middle East  people coming out of jail. And for the veterans in particular  the V.A. said there's a six fold increase in mental health pharmaceuticals by vets since     . I think that number's probably going to go up. They're not the largest number of people  but they are some of the most expensive    and in terms of the likelihood for domestic abuse  drug and alcohol abuse  poor performance by their kids in schools and also poor health as a result of stress. So these three guys all understand how to productively channel dollars through our local economies to meet existing market demands  reduce the social problems that we have now and prevent new problems in the future. And there are plenty of other examples like that. One problem  waste handling and unemployment. Even when we think or talk about recycling  lots of recyclable stuff ends up getting incinerated or in landfills and leaving many municipalities  diversion rates    they leave much to be recycled. And where is this waste handled  Usually in poor communities. And we know that eco industrial business  these kinds of business models    there's a model in Europe called the eco industrial park  where either the waste of one company is the raw material for another  or you use recycled materials to make goods that you can actually use and sell. We can create these local markets and incentives for recycled materials to be used as raw materials for manufacturing. And in my hometown  we actually tried to do one of these in the Bronx  but our mayor decided what he wanted to see was a jail on that same spot. Fortunately    because we wanted to create hundreds of jobs    but after many years  the city wanted to build a jail. They've since abandoned that project  thank goodness. Another problem  unhealthy food systems and unemployment. Working class and poor urban Americans are not benefiting economically from our current food system. It relies too much on transportation  chemical fertilization  big use of water and also refrigeration. Mega agricultural operations often are responsible for poisoning our waterways and our land  and it produces this incredibly unhealthy product that costs us billions in healthcare and lost productivity. And so we know  urban ag  is a big buzz topic this time of the year  but it's mostly gardening  which has some value in community building    lots of it    but it's not in terms of creating jobs or for food production. The numbers just aren't there. Part of my work now is really laying the groundwork to integrate urban ag and rural food systems to hasten the demise of the       mile salad by creating a national brand of urban grown produce in every city  that uses regional growing power and augments it with indoor growing facilities  owned and operated by small growers  where now there are only consumers. This can support seasonal farmers around metro areas who are losing out because they really can't meet the year round demand for produce. It's not a competition with rural farm  it's actually reinforcements. It allies in a really positive and economically viable food system. The goal is to meet the cities' institutional demands for hospitals  senior centers  schools  daycare centers  and produce a network of regional jobs  as well. This is smart infrastructure. And how we manage our built environment affects the health and well being of people every single day. Our municipalities  rural and urban  play the operational course of infrastructure    things like waste disposal  energy demand  as well as social costs of unemployment  drop out rates  incarceration rates and the impacts of various public health costs. Smart infrastructure can provide cost saving ways for municipalities to handle both infrastructure and social needs. And we want to shift the systems that open the doors for people who were formerly tax burdens to become part of the tax base. And imagine a national business model that creates local jobs and smart infrastructure to improve local economic stability. So I'm hoping you can see a little theme here. These examples indicate a trend. I haven't created it  and it's not happening by accident. I'm noticing that it's happening all over the country  and the good news is that it's growing. And we all need to be invested in it. It is an essential pillar to this country's recovery. And I call it  hometown security.  The recession has us reeling and fearful  and there's something in the air these days that is also very empowering. It's a realization that we are the key to our own recovery. Now is the time for us to act in our own communities where we think local and we act local. And when we do that  our neighbors    be they next door  or in the next state  or in the next country    will be just fine. The sum of the local is the global. Hometown security means rebuilding our natural defenses  putting people to work  restoring our natural systems. Hometown security means creating wealth here at home  instead of destroying it overseas. Tackling social and environmental problems at the same time with the same solution yields great cost savings  wealth generation and national security. Many great and inspiring solutions have been generated across America. The challenge for us now is to identify and support countless more. Now  hometown security is about taking care of your own  but it's not like the old saying   charity begins at home.  I recently read a book called  Love Leadership  by John Hope Bryant. And it's about leading in a world that really does seem to be operating on the basis of fear. And reading that book made me reexamine that theory because I need to explain what I mean by that. See  my dad was a great  great man in many ways. He grew up in the segregated South  escaped lynching and all that during some really hard times  and he provided a really stable home for me and my siblings and a whole bunch of other people that fell on hard times. But  like all of us  he had some problems. And his was gambling  compulsively. To him that phrase   Charity begins at home   meant that my payday    or someone else's    would just happen to coincide with his lucky day. So you need to help him out. And sometimes I would loan him money from my after school or summer jobs  and he always had the great intention of paying me back with interest  of course  after he hit it big. And he did sometimes  believe it or not  at a racetrack in Los Angeles    one reason to love L.A.    back in the     s. He made        dollars cash and bought the house that I grew up in. So I'm not that unhappy about that. But listen  I did feel obligated to him  and I grew up    then I grew up. And I'm a grown woman now  and I have learned a few things along the way. To me  charity often is just about giving  because you're supposed to  or because it's what you've always done  or it's about giving until it hurts. I'm about providing the means to build something that will grow and intensify its original investment and not just require greater giving next year    I'm not trying to feed the habit. I spent some years watching how good intentions for community empowerment  that were supposed to be there to support the community and empower it  actually left people in the same  if not worse  position that they were in before. And over the past    years  we've spent record amounts of philanthropic dollars on social problems  yet educational outcomes  malnutrition  incarceration  obesity  diabetes  income disparity  they've all gone up with some exceptions    in particular  infant mortality among people in poverty    but it's a great world that we're bringing them into as well. And I know a little bit about these issues  because  for many years  I spent a long time in the non profit industrial complex  and I'm a recovering executive director  two years clean. But during that time  I realized that it was about projects and developing them on the local level that really was going to do the right thing for our communities. But I really did struggle for financial support. The greater our success  the less money came in from foundations. And I tell you  being on the TED stage and winning a MacArthur in the same exact year gave everyone the impression that I had arrived. And by the time I'd moved on  I was actually covering a third of my agency's budget deficit with speaking fees. And I think because early on  frankly  my programs were just a little bit ahead of their time. But since then  the park that was just a dump and was featured at a TED     Talk became this little thing. But I did in fact get married in it. Over here. There goes my dog who led me to the park in my wedding. The South Bronx Greenway was also just a drawing on the stage back in     . Since then  we got about    million dollars in stimulus package money to come and get here. And we love this  because I love construction now  because we're watching these things actually happen. So I want everyone to understand the critical importance of shifting charity into enterprise. I started my firm to help communities across the country realize their own potential to improve everything about the quality of life for their people. Hometown security is next on my to do list. What we need are people who see the value in investing in these types of local enterprises  who will partner with folks like me to identify the growth trends and climate adaptation as well as understand the growing social costs of business as usual. We need to work together to embrace and repair our land  repair our power systems and repair ourselves. It's time to stop building the shopping malls  the prisons  the stadiums and other tributes to all of our collective failures. It is time that we start building living monuments to hope and possibility. Thank you very much. So  I'll start with this  a couple years ago  an event planner called me because I was going to do a speaking event. And she called  and she said   I'm really struggling with how to write about you on the little flyer.  And I thought   Well  what's the struggle   And she said   Well  I saw you speak  and I'm going to call you a researcher  I think  but I'm afraid if I call you a researcher  no one will come  because they'll think you're boring and irrelevant.  And I was like   Okay.  And she said   But the thing I liked about your talk is you're a storyteller. So I think what I'll do is just call you a storyteller.  And of course  the academic  insecure part of me was like   You're going to call me a what   And she said   I'm going to call you a storyteller.  And I was like   Why not 'magic pixie'   I was like   Let me think about this for a second.  I tried to call deep on my courage. And I thought  you know  I am a storyteller. I'm a qualitative researcher. I collect stories  that's what I do. And maybe stories are just data with a soul. And maybe I'm just a storyteller. And so I said   You know what  Why don't you just say I'm a researcher storyteller.  And she went   Ha ha. There's no such thing.  So I'm a researcher storyteller  and I'm going to talk to you today    we're talking about expanding perception    and so I want to talk to you and tell some stories about a piece of my research that fundamentally expanded my perception and really actually changed the way that I live and love and work and parent. And this is where my story starts. When I was a young researcher  doctoral student  my first year  I had a research professor who said to us   Here's the thing  if you cannot measure it  it does not exist.  And I thought he was just sweet talking me. I was like   Really   and he was like   Absolutely.  And so you have to understand that I have a bachelor's and a master's in social work  and I was getting my Ph.D. in social work  so my entire academic career was surrounded by people who kind of believed in the  life's messy  love it.  And I'm more of the   life's messy  clean it up  organize it and put it into a bento box.  And so to think that I had found my way  to found a career that takes me    really  one of the big sayings in social work is   Lean into the discomfort of the work.  And I'm like  knock discomfort upside the head and move it over and get all A's. That was my mantra. So I was very excited about this. And so I thought  you know what  this is the career for me  because I am interested in some messy topics. But I want to be able to make them not messy. I want to understand them. I want to hack into these things that I know are important and lay the code out for everyone to see. So where I started was with connection. Because  by the time you're a social worker for    years  what you realize is that connection is why we're here. It's what gives purpose and meaning to our lives. This is what it's all about. It doesn't matter whether you talk to people who work in social justice  mental health and abuse and neglect  what we know is that connection  the ability to feel connected  is    neurobiologically that's how we're wired    it's why we're here. So I thought  you know what  I'm going to start with connection. Well  you know that situation where you get an evaluation from your boss  and she tells you    things that you do really awesome  and one  opportunity for growth   And all you can think about is that opportunity for growth  right  Well  apparently this is the way my work went as well  because  when you ask people about love  they tell you about heartbreak. When you ask people about belonging  they'll tell you their most excruciating experiences of being excluded. And when you ask people about connection  the stories they told me were about disconnection. So very quickly    really about six weeks into this research    I ran into this unnamed thing that absolutely unraveled connection in a way that I didn't understand or had never seen. And so I pulled back out of the research and thought  I need to figure out what this is. And it turned out to be shame. And shame is really easily understood as the fear of disconnection  Is there something about me that  if other people know it or see it  that I won't be worthy of connection  The things I can tell you about it  It's universal  we all have it. The only people who don't experience shame have no capacity for human empathy or connection. No one wants to talk about it  and the less you talk about it  the more you have it. What underpinned this shame  this  I'm not good enough      which  we all know that feeling   I'm not blank enough. I'm not thin enough  rich enough  beautiful enough  smart enough  promoted enough.  The thing that underpinned this was excruciating vulnerability. This idea of  in order for connection to happen  we have to allow ourselves to be seen  really seen. And you know how I feel about vulnerability. I hate vulnerability. And so I thought  this is my chance to beat it back with my measuring stick. I'm going in  I'm going to figure this stuff out  I'm going to spend a year  I'm going to totally deconstruct shame  I'm going to understand how vulnerability works  and I'm going to outsmart it. So I was ready  and I was really excited. As you know  it's not going to turn out well. You know this. So  I could tell you a lot about shame  but I'd have to borrow everyone else's time. But here's what I can tell you that it boils down to    and this may be one of the most important things that I've ever learned in the decade of doing this research. My one year turned into six years  Thousands of stories  hundreds of long interviews  focus groups. At one point  people were sending me journal pages and sending me their stories    thousands of pieces of data in six years. And I kind of got a handle on it. I kind of understood  this is what shame is  this is how it works. I wrote a book  I published a theory  but something was not okay    and what it was is that  if I roughly took the people I interviewed and divided them into people who really have a sense of worthiness    that's what this comes down to  a sense of worthiness    they have a strong sense of love and belonging    and folks who struggle for it  and folks who are always wondering if they're good enough. There was only one variable that separated the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging and the people who really struggle for it. And that was  the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging believe they're worthy of love and belonging. That's it. They believe they're worthy. And to me  the hard part of the one thing that keeps us out of connection is our fear that we're not worthy of connection  was something that  personally and professionally  I felt like I needed to understand better. So what I did is I took all of the interviews where I saw worthiness  where I saw people living that way  and just looked at those. What do these people have in common  I have a slight office supply addiction  but that's another talk. So I had a manila folder  and I had a Sharpie  and I was like  what am I going to call this research  And the first words that came to my mind were  whole hearted.  These are whole hearted people  living from this deep sense of worthiness. So I wrote at the top of the manila folder  and I started looking at the data. In fact  I did it first in a four day  very intensive data analysis  where I went back  pulled the interviews  the stories  pulled the incidents. What's the theme  What's the pattern  My husband left town with the kids because I always go into this Jackson Pollock crazy thing  where I'm just writing and in my researcher mode. And so here's what I found. What they had in common was a sense of courage. And I want to separate courage and bravery for you for a minute. Courage  the original definition of courage  when it first came into the English language    it's from the Latin word  cor   meaning  heart     and the original definition was to tell the story of who you are with your whole heart. And so these folks had  very simply  the courage to be imperfect. They had the compassion to be kind to themselves first and then to others  because  as it turns out  we can't practice compassion with other people if we can't treat ourselves kindly. And the last was they had connection  and    this was the hard part    as a result of authenticity  they were willing to let go of who they thought they should be in order to be who they were  which you have to absolutely do that for connection. The other thing that they had in common was this  They fully embraced vulnerability. They believed that what made them vulnerable made them beautiful. They didn't talk about vulnerability being comfortable  nor did they really talk about it being excruciating    as I had heard it earlier in the shame interviewing. They just talked about it being necessary. They talked about the willingness to say   I love you  first ... the willingness to do something where there are no guarantees ... the willingness to breathe through waiting for the doctor to call after your mammogram. They're willing to invest in a relationship that may or may not work out. They thought this was fundamental. I personally thought it was betrayal. I could not believe I had pledged allegiance to research  where our job    you know  the definition of research is to control and predict  to study phenomena for the explicit reason to control and predict. And now my mission to control and predict had turned up the answer that the way to live is with vulnerability and to stop controlling and predicting. This led to a little breakdown       which actually looked more like this. And it did. I call it a breakdown  my therapist calls it a spiritual awakening. A spiritual awakening sounds better than breakdown  but I assure you  it was a breakdown. And I had to put my data away and go find a therapist. Let me tell you something  you know who you are when you call your friends and say   I think I need to see somebody. Do you have any recommendations   Because about five of my friends were like   Wooo  I wouldn't want to be your therapist.  I was like   What does that mean   And they're like   I'm just saying  you know. Don't bring your measuring stick.  I was like   Okay.  So I found a therapist. My first meeting with her  Diana    I brought in my list of the way the whole hearted live  and I sat down. And she said   How are you   And I said   I'm great. I'm okay.  She said   What's going on   And this is a therapist who sees therapists  because we have to go to those  because their B.S. meters are good. And so I said   Here's the thing  I'm struggling.  And she said   What's the struggle   And I said   Well  I have a vulnerability issue. And I know that vulnerability is the core of shame and fear and our struggle for worthiness  but it appears that it's also the birthplace of joy  of creativity  of belonging  of love. And I think I have a problem  and I need some help.  And I said   But here's the thing  no family stuff  no childhood shit.   I just need some strategies.  Thank you. So she goes like this. And then I said   It's bad  right   And she said   It's neither good nor bad.   It just is what it is.  And I said   Oh my God  this is going to suck.  And it did  and it didn't. And it took about a year. And you know how there are people that  when they realize that vulnerability and tenderness are important  that they surrender and walk into it. A  that's not me  and B  I don't even hang out with people like that. For me  it was a yearlong street fight. It was a slugfest. Vulnerability pushed  I pushed back. I lost the fight  but probably won my life back. And so then I went back into the research and spent the next couple of years really trying to understand what they  the whole hearted  what choices they were making  and what we are doing with vulnerability. Why do we struggle with it so much  Am I alone in struggling with vulnerability  No. So this is what I learned. We numb vulnerability    when we're waiting for the call. It was funny  I sent something out on Twitter and on Facebook that says   How would you define vulnerability  What makes you feel vulnerable   And within an hour and a half  I had     responses. Because I wanted to know what's out there. Having to ask my husband for help because I'm sick  and we're newly married  initiating sex with my husband  initiating sex with my wife  being turned down  asking someone out  waiting for the doctor to call back  getting laid off  laying off people. This is the world we live in. We live in a vulnerable world. And one of the ways we deal with it is we numb vulnerability. And I think there's evidence    and it's not the only reason this evidence exists  but I think it's a huge cause    We are the most in debt ... obese ... addicted and medicated adult cohort in U.S. history. The problem is    and I learned this from the research    that you cannot selectively numb emotion. You can't say  here's the bad stuff. Here's vulnerability  here's grief  here's shame  here's fear  here's disappointment. I don't want to feel these. I'm going to have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin. I don't want to feel these. And I know that's knowing laughter. I hack into your lives for a living. God. You can't numb those hard feelings without numbing the other affects  our emotions. You cannot selectively numb. So when we numb those  we numb joy  we numb gratitude  we numb happiness. And then  we are miserable  and we are looking for purpose and meaning  and then we feel vulnerable  so then we have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin. And it becomes this dangerous cycle. One of the things that I think we need to think about is why and how we numb. And it doesn't just have to be addiction. The other thing we do is we make everything that's uncertain certain. Religion has gone from a belief in faith and mystery to certainty.  I'm right  you're wrong. Shut up.  That's it. Just certain. The more afraid we are  the more vulnerable we are  the more afraid we are. This is what politics looks like today. There's no discourse anymore. There's no conversation. There's just blame. You know how blame is described in the research  A way to discharge pain and discomfort. We perfect. If there's anyone who wants their life to look like this  it would be me  but it doesn't work. Because what we do is we take fat from our butts and put it in our cheeks. Which just  I hope in     years  people will look back and go   Wow.  And we perfect  most dangerously  our children. Let me tell you what we think about children. They're hardwired for struggle when they get here. And when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand  our job is not to say   Look at her  she's perfect. My job is just to keep her perfect    make sure she makes the tennis team by fifth grade and Yale by seventh.  That's not our job. Our job is to look and say   You know what  You're imperfect  and you're wired for struggle  but you are worthy of love and belonging.  That's our job. Show me a generation of kids raised like that  and we'll end the problems  I think  that we see today. We pretend that what we do doesn't have an effect on people. We do that in our personal lives. We do that corporate    whether it's a bailout  an oil spill ... a recall. We pretend like what we're doing doesn't have a huge impact on other people. I would say to companies  this is not our first rodeo  people. We just need you to be authentic and real and say ...  We're sorry. We'll fix it.  But there's another way  and I'll leave you with this. This is what I have found  To let ourselves be seen  deeply seen  vulnerably seen ... to love with our whole hearts  even though there's no guarantee    and that's really hard  and I can tell you as a parent  that's excruciatingly difficult    to practice gratitude and joy in those moments of terror  when we're wondering   Can I love you this much  Can I believe in this this passionately  Can I be this fierce about this   just to be able to stop and  instead of catastrophizing what might happen  to say   I'm just so grateful  because to feel this vulnerable means I'm alive.  And the last  which I think is probably the most important  is to believe that we're enough. Because when we work from a place  I believe  that says   I'm enough  ... then we stop screaming and start listening  we're kinder and gentler to the people around us  and we're kinder and gentler to ourselves. That's all I have. Thank you. The first thing I want to do is say thank you to all of you. The second thing I want to do is introduce my co author and dear friend and co teacher. Ken and I have been working together for almost    years. That's Ken Sharpe over there. So there is among many people    certainly me and most of the people I talk to    a kind of collective dissatisfaction with the way things are working  with the way our institutions run. Our kids' teachers seem to be failing them. Our doctors don't know who the hell we are  and they don't have enough time for us. We certainly can't trust the bankers  and we certainly can't trust the brokers. They almost brought the entire financial system down. And even as we do our own work  all too often  we find ourselves having to choose between doing what we think is the right thing and doing the expected thing  or the required thing  or the profitable thing. So everywhere we look  pretty much across the board  we worry that the people we depend on don't really have our interests at heart. Or if they do have our interests at heart  we worry that they don't know us well enough to figure out what they need to do in order to allow us to secure those interests. They don't understand us. They don't have the time to get to know us. There are two kinds of responses that we make to this sort of general dissatisfaction. If things aren't going right  the first response is  let's make more rules  let's set up a set of detailed procedures to make sure that people will do the right thing. Give teachers scripts to follow in the classroom  so even if they don't know what they're doing and don't care about the welfare of our kids  as long as they follow the scripts  our kids will get educated. Give judges a list of mandatory sentences to impose for crimes  so that you don't need to rely on judges using their judgment. Instead  all they have to do is look up on the list what kind of sentence goes with what kind of crime. Impose limits on what credit card companies can charge in interest and on what they can charge in fees. More and more rules to protect us against an indifferent  uncaring set of institutions we have to deal with. Or    or maybe and    in addition to rules  let's see if we can come up with some really clever incentives so that  even if the people we deal with don't particularly want to serve our interests  it is in their interest to serve our interest    the magic incentives that will get people to do the right thing even out of pure selfishness. So we offer teachers bonuses if the kids they teach score passing grades on these big test scores that are used to evaluate the quality of school systems. Rules and incentives     sticks  and  carrots.  We passed a bunch of rules to regulate the financial industry in response to the recent collapse. There's the Dodd Frank Act  there's the new Consumer Financial Protection Agency that is temporarily being headed through the backdoor by Elizabeth Warren. Maybe these rules will actually improve the way these financial services companies behave. We'll see. In addition  we are struggling to find some way to create incentives for people in the financial services industry that will have them more interested in serving the long term interests even of their own companies  rather than securing short term profits. So if we find just the right incentives  they'll do the right thing    as I said    selfishly  and if we come up with the right rules and regulations  they won't drive us all over a cliff. And Ken  Sharpe  and I certainly know that you need to reign in the bankers. If there is a lesson to be learned from the financial collapse it is that. But what we believe  and what we argue in the book  is that there is no set of rules  no matter how detailed  no matter how specific  no matter how carefully monitored and enforced  there is no set of rules that will get us what we need. Why  Because bankers are smart people. And  like water  they will find cracks in any set of rules. You design a set of rules that will make sure that the particular reason why the financial system  almost collapse  can't happen again. It is naive beyond description to think that having blocked this source of financial collapse  you have blocked all possible sources of financial collapse. So it's just a question of waiting for the next one and then marveling at how we could have been so stupid as not to protect ourselves against that. What we desperately need  beyond  or along with  better rules and reasonably smart incentives  is we need virtue. We need character. We need people who want to do the right thing. And in particular  the virtue that we need most of all is the virtue that Aristotle called  practical wisdom.  Practical wisdom is the moral will to do the right thing and the moral skill to figure out what the right thing is. So Aristotle was very interested in watching how the craftsmen around him worked. And he was impressed at how they would improvise novel solutions to novel problems    problems that they hadn't anticipated. So one example is he sees these stonemasons working on the Isle of Lesbos  and they need to measure out round columns. Well if you think about it  it's really hard to measure out round columns using a ruler. So what do they do  They fashion a novel solution to the problem. They created a ruler that bends  what we would call these days a tape measure    a flexible rule  a rule that bends. And Aristotle said   Hah  they appreciated that sometimes to design rounded columns  you need to bend the rule.  And Aristotle said often in dealing with other people  we need to bend the rules. Dealing with other people demands a kind of flexibility that no set of rules can encompass. Wise people know when and how to bend the rules. Wise people know how to improvise. The way my co author   Ken  and I talk about it  they are kind of like jazz musicians. The rules are like the notes on the page  and that gets you started  but then you dance around the notes on the page  coming up with just the right combination for this particular moment with this particular set of fellow players. So for Aristotle  the kind of rule bending  rule exception finding and improvisation that you see in skilled craftsmen is exactly what you need to be a skilled moral craftsman. And in interactions with people  almost all the time  it is this kind of flexibility that is required. A wise person knows when to bend the rules. A wise person knows when to improvise. And most important  a wise person does this improvising and rule bending in the service of the right aims. If you are a rule bender and an improviser mostly to serve yourself  what you get is ruthless manipulation of other people. So it matters that you do this wise practice in the service of others and not in the service of yourself. And so the will to do the right thing is just as important as the moral skill of improvisation and exception finding. Together they comprise practical wisdom  which Aristotle thought was the master virtue. So I'll give you an example of wise practice in action. It's the case of Michael. Michael's a young guy. He had a pretty low wage job. He was supporting his wife and a child  and the child was going to parochial school. Then he lost his job. He panicked about being able to support his family. One night  he drank a little too much  and he robbed a cab driver    stole    dollars. He robbed him at gunpoint. It was a toy gun. He got caught. He got tried. He got convicted. The Pennsylvania sentencing guidelines required a minimum sentence for a crime like this of two years     months. The judge on the case  Judge Lois Forer thought that this made no sense. He had never committed a crime before. He was a responsible husband and father. He had been faced with desperate circumstances. All this would do is wreck a family. And so she improvised a sentence       months  and not only that  but release every day to go to work. Spend your night in jail  spend your day holding down a job. He did. He served out his sentence. He made restitution and found himself a new job. And the family was united. And it seemed on the road to some sort of a decent life    a happy ending to a story involving wise improvisation from a wise judge. But it turned out the prosecutor was not happy that Judge Forer ignored the sentencing guidelines and sort of invented her own  and so he appealed. And he asked for the mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery. He did after all have a toy gun. The mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery is five years. He won the appeal. Michael was sentenced to five years in prison. Judge Forer had to follow the law. And by the way  this appeal went through after he had finished serving his sentence  so he was out and working at a job and taking care of his family and he had to go back into jail. Judge Forer did what she was required to do  and then she quit the bench. And Michael disappeared. So that is an example  both of wisdom in practice and the subversion of wisdom by rules that are meant  of course  to make things better. Now consider Ms. Dewey. Ms. Dewey's a teacher in a Texas elementary school. She found herself listening to a consultant one day who was trying to help teachers boost the test scores of the kids  so that the school would reach the elite category in percentage of kids passing big tests. All these schools in Texas compete with one another to achieve these milestones  and there are bonuses and various other treats that come if you beat the other schools. So here was the consultant's advice  first  don't waste your time on kids who are going to pass the test no matter what you do. Second  don't waste your time on kids who can't pass the test no matter what you do. Third  don't waste your time on kids who moved into the district too late for their scores to be counted. Focus all of your time and attention on the kids who are on the bubble  the so called  bubble kids     kids where your intervention can get them just maybe over the line from failing to passing. So Ms. Dewey heard this  and she shook her head in despair while fellow teachers were sort of cheering each other on and nodding approvingly. It's like they were about to go play a football game. For Ms. Dewey  this isn't why she became a teacher. Now Ken and I are not naive  and we understand that you need to have rules. You need to have incentives. People have to make a living. But the problem with relying on rules and incentives is that they demoralize professional activity  and they demoralize professional activity in two senses. First  they demoralize the people who are engaged in the activity. Judge Forer quits  and Ms. Dewey in completely disheartened. And second  they demoralize the activity itself. The very practice is demoralized  and the practitioners are demoralized. It creates people    when you manipulate incentives to get people to do the right thing    it creates people who are addicted to incentives. That is to say  it creates people who only do things for incentives. Now the striking thing about this is that psychologists have known this for    years. Psychologists have known about the negative consequences of incentivizing everything for    years. We know that if you reward kids for drawing pictures  they stop caring about the drawing and care only about the reward. If you reward kids for reading books  they stop caring about what's in the books and only care about how long they are. If you reward teachers for kids' test scores  they stop caring about educating and only care about test preparation. If you were to reward doctors for doing more procedures    which is the current system    they would do more. If instead you reward doctors for doing fewer procedures  they will do fewer. What we want  of course  is doctors who do just the right amount of procedures and do the right amount for the right reason    namely  to serve the welfare of their patients. Psychologists have known this for decades  and it's time for policymakers to start paying attention and listen to psychologists a little bit  instead of economists. And it doesn't have to be this way. We think  Ken and I  that there are real sources of hope. We identify one set of people in all of these practices who we call canny outlaws. These are people who  being forced to operate in a system that demands rule following and creates incentives  find away around the rules  find a way to subvert the rules. So there are teachers who have these scripts to follow  and they know that if they follow these scripts  the kids will learn nothing. And so what they do is they follow the scripts  but they follow the scripts at double time and squirrel away little bits of extra time during which they teach in the way that they actually know is effective. So these are little ordinary  everyday heroes  and they're incredibly admirable  but there's no way that they can sustain this kind of activity in the face of a system that either roots them out or grinds them down. So canny outlaws are better than nothing  but it's hard to imagine any canny outlaw sustaining that for an indefinite period of time. More hopeful are people we call system changers. These are people who are looking not to dodge the system's rules and regulations  but to transform the system  and we talk about several. One in particular is a judge named Robert Russell. And one day he was faced with the case of Gary Pettengill. Pettengill was a    year old vet who had planned to make the army a career  but then he got a severe back injury in Iraq  and that forced him to take a medical discharge. He was married  he had a third kid on the way  he suffered from PTSD  in addition to the bad back  and recurrent nightmares  and he had started using marijuana to ease some of the symptoms. He was only able to get part time work because of his back  and so he was unable to earn enough to put food on the table and take care of his family. So he started selling marijuana. He was busted in a drug sweep. His family was kicked out of their apartment  and the welfare system was threatening to take away his kids. Under normal sentencing procedures  Judge Russell would have had little choice but to sentence Pettengill to serious jail time as a drug felon. But Judge Russell did have an alternative. And that's because he was in a special court. He was in a court called the Veterans' Court. In the Veterans' Court    this was the first of its kind in the United States. Judge Russell created the Veterans' Court. It was a court only for veterans who had broken the law. And he had created it exactly because mandatory sentencing laws were taking the judgment out of judging. No one wanted non violent offenders    and especially non violent offenders who were veterans to boot    to be thrown into prison. They wanted to do something about what we all know  namely the revolving door of the criminal justice system. And what the Veterans' Court did  was it treated each criminal as an individual  tried to get inside their problems  tried to fashion responses to their crimes that helped them to rehabilitate themselves  and didn't forget about them once the judgment was made. Stayed with them  followed up on them  made sure that they were sticking to whatever plan had been jointly developed to get them over the hump. There are now    cities that have Veterans' Courts like this. Why has the idea spread  Well  one reason is that Judge Russell has now seen     vets in his Veterans' Court as of February of this year  and out of      guess how many have gone back through the revolving door of justice into prison. None. None. Anyone would glom onto a criminal justice system that has this kind of a record. So here's is a system changer  and it seems to be catching. There's a banker who created a for profit community bank that encouraged bankers    I know this is hard to believe    encouraged bankers who worked there to do well by doing good for their low income clients. The bank helped finance the rebuilding of what was otherwise a dying community. Though their loan recipients were high risk by ordinary standards  the default rate was extremely low. The bank was profitable. The bankers stayed with their loan recipients. They didn't make loans and then sell the loans. They serviced the loans. They made sure that their loan recipients were staying up with their payments. Banking hasn't always been the way we read about it now in the newspapers. Even Goldman Sachs once used to serve clients  before it turned into an institution that serves only itself. Banking wasn't always this way  and it doesn't have to be this way. So there are examples like this in medicine    doctors at Harvard who are trying to transform medical education  so that you don't get a kind of ethical erosion and loss of empathy  which characterizes most medical students in the course of their medical training. And the way they do it is to give third year medical students patients who they follow for an entire year. So the patients are not organ systems  and they're not diseases  they're people  people with lives. And in order to be an effective doctor  you need to treat people who have lives and not just disease. In addition to which there's an enormous amount of back and forth  mentoring of one student by another  of all the students by the doctors  and the result is a generation    we hope    of doctors who do have time for the people they treat. We'll see. So there are lots of examples like this that we talk about. Each of them shows that it is possible to build on and nurture character and keep a profession true to its proper mission    what Aristotle would have called its proper telos. And Ken and I believe that this is what practitioners actually want. People want to be allowed to be virtuous. They want to have permission to do the right thing. They don't want to feel like they need to take a shower to get the moral grime off their bodies everyday when they come home from work. Aristotle thought that practical wisdom was the key to happiness  and he was right. There's now a lot of research being done in psychology on what makes people happy  and the two things that jump out in study after study    I know this will come as a shock to all of you    the two things that matter most to happiness are love and work. Love  managing successfully relations with the people who are close to you and with the communities of which you are a part. Work  engaging in activities that are meaningful and satisfying. If you have that  good close relations with other people  work that's meaningful and fulfilling  you don't much need anything else. Well  to love well and to work well  you need wisdom. Rules and incentives don't tell you how to be a good friend  how to be a good parent  how to be a good spouse  or how to be a good doctor or a good lawyer or a good teacher. Rules and incentives are no substitutes for wisdom. Indeed  we argue  there is no substitute for wisdom. And so practical wisdom does not require heroic acts of self sacrifice on the part of practitioners. In giving us the will and the skill to do the right thing    to do right by others    practical wisdom also gives us the will and the skill to do right by ourselves. Thanks. My big idea is a very  very small idea that can unlock billions of big ideas that are at the moment dormant inside us. And my little idea that will do that is sleep. This is a room of type A women. This is a room of sleep deprived women. And I learned the hard way  the value of sleep. Two and a half years ago  I fainted from exhaustion. I hit my head on my desk. I broke my cheekbone  I got five stitches on my right eye. And I began the journey of rediscovering the value of sleep. And in the course of that  I studied  I met with medical doctors  scientists  and I'm here to tell you that the way to a more productive  more inspired  more joyful life is getting enough sleep. And we women are going to lead the way in this new revolution  this new feminist issue. We are literally going to sleep our way to the top  literally. Because unfortunately for men  sleep deprivation has become a virility symbol. I was recently having dinner with a guy who bragged that he had only gotten four hours sleep the night before. And I felt like saying to him    but I didn't say it    I felt like saying   You know what  If you had gotten five  this dinner would have been a lot more interesting.  There is now a kind of sleep deprivation one upmanship. Especially here in Washington  if you try to make a breakfast date  and you say   How about eight o'clock   they're likely to tell you   Eight o'clock is too late for me  but that's okay  I can get a game of tennis in and do a few conference calls and meet you at eight.  And they think that means that they are so incredibly busy and productive  but the truth is they're not  because we  at the moment  have had brilliant leaders in business  in finance  in politics  making terrible decisions. So a high I.Q. does not mean that you're a good leader  because the essence of leadership is being able to see the iceberg before it hits the Titanic. And we've had far too many icebergs hitting our Titanics. In fact  I have a feeling that if Lehman Brothers was Lehman Brothers and Sisters  they might still be around. While all the brothers were busy just being hyper connected       maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg  because she would have woken up from a seven and a half  or eight hour sleep and have been able to see the big picture. So as we are facing all the multiple crises in our world at the moment  what is good for us on a personal level  what's going to bring more joy  gratitude  effectiveness in our lives and be the best for our own careers is also what is best for the world. So I urge you to shut your eyes and discover the great ideas that lie inside us  to shut your engines and discover the power of sleep. Thank you. You may have heard about the Koran's idea of paradise being    virgins  and I promise I will come back to those virgins. But in fact  here in the northwest  we're living very close to the real Koranic idea of paradise  defined    times as  gardens watered by running streams.  Since I live on a houseboat on the running stream of Lake Union  this makes perfect sense to me. But the thing is  how come it's news to most people  I know many well intentioned non Muslims who've begun reading the Koran  but given up  disconcerted by its  otherness.  The historian Thomas Carlyle considered Muhammad one of the world's greatest heroes  yet even he called the Koran  as toilsome reading as I ever undertook  a wearisome  confused jumble.  Part of the problem  I think  is that we imagine that the Koran can be read as we usually read a book    as though we can curl up with it on a rainy afternoon with a bowl of popcorn within reach  as though God    and the Koran is entirely in the voice of God speaking to Muhammad    were just another author on the bestseller list. Yet the fact that so few people do actually read the Koran is precisely why it's so easy to quote    that is  to misquote. Phrases and snippets taken out of context in what I call the  highlighter version   which is the one favored by both Muslim fundamentalists and anti Muslim Islamophobes. So this past spring  as I was gearing up to begin writing a biography of Muhammad  I realized I needed to read the Koran properly    as properly as I could  that is. My Arabic's reduced by now to wielding a dictionary  so I took four well known translations and decided to read them side by side  verse by verse along with a transliteration and the original seventh century Arabic. Now I did have an advantage. My last book was about the story behind the Shi'a Sunni split  and for that I'd worked closely with the earliest Islamic histories  so I knew the events to which the Koran constantly refers  its frame of reference. I knew enough  that is  to know that I'd be a tourist in the Koran    an informed one  an experienced one even  but still an outsider  an agnostic Jew reading some else's holy book. So I read slowly. I'd set aside three weeks for this project  and that  I think  is what is meant by  hubris        because it turned out to be three months. I did resist the temptation to skip to the back where the shorter and more clearly mystical chapters are. But every time I thought I was beginning to get a handle on the Koran    that feeling of  I get it now     it would slip away overnight  and I'd come back in the morning wondering if I wasn't lost in a strange land  and yet the terrain was very familiar. The Koran declares that it comes to renew the message of the Torah and the Gospels. So one third of it reprises the stories of Biblical figures like Abraham  Moses  Joseph  Mary  Jesus. God himself was utterly familiar from his earlier manifestation as Yahweh    jealously insisting on no other gods. The presence of camels  mountains  desert wells and springs took me back to the year I spent wandering the Sinai Desert. And then there was the language  the rhythmic cadence of it  reminding me of evenings spent listening to Bedouin elders recite hours long narrative poems entirely from memory. And I began to grasp why it's said that the Koran is really the Koran only in Arabic. Take the Fatihah  the seven verse opening chapter that is the Lord's Prayer and the Shema Yisrael of Islam combined. It's just    words in Arabic  but anywhere from    to    in translation. And yet the more you add  the more seems to go missing. The Arabic has an incantatory  almost hypnotic  quality that begs to be heard rather than read  felt more than analyzed. It wants to be chanted out loud  to sound its music in the ear and on the tongue. So the Koran in English is a kind of shadow of itself  or as Arthur Arberry called his version   an interpretation.  But all is not lost in translation. As the Koran promises  patience is rewarded  and there are many surprises    a degree of environmental awareness  for instance  and of humans as mere stewards of God's creation  unmatched in the Bible. And where the Bible is addressed exclusively to men  using the second and third person masculine  the Koran includes women    talking  for instance  of believing men and believing women  honorable men and honorable women. Or take the infamous verse about killing the unbelievers. Yes  it does say that  but in a very specific context  the anticipated conquest of the sanctuary city of Mecca where fighting was usually forbidden  and the permission comes hedged about with qualifiers. Not  You must kill unbelievers in Mecca   but you can  you are allowed to  but only after a grace period is over and only if there's no other pact in place and only if they try to stop you getting to the Kaaba  and only if they attack you first. And even then    God is merciful  forgiveness is supreme    and so  essentially  better if you don't. This was perhaps the biggest surprise    how flexible the Koran is  at least in minds that are not fundamentally inflexible.  Some of these verses are definite in meaning   it says   and others are ambiguous.  The perverse at heart will seek out the ambiguities  trying to create discord by pinning down meanings of their own. Only God knows the true meaning. The phrase  God is subtle  appears again and again  and indeed  the whole of the Koran is far more subtle than most of us have been led to believe. As in  for instance  that little matter of virgins and paradise. Old fashioned Orientalism comes into play here. The word used four times is Houris  rendered as dark eyed maidens with swelling breasts  or as fair  high bosomed virgins. Yet all there is in the original Arabic is that one word  Houris. Not a swelling breast nor a high bosom in sight. Now this may be a way of saying  pure beings     like in angels    or it may be like the Greek Kouros or K r   an eternal youth. But the truth is nobody really knows  and that's the point. Because the Koran is quite clear when it says that you'll be  a new creation in paradise  and that you will be  recreated in a form unknown to you   which seems to me a far more appealing prospect than a virgin. And that number    never appears. There are no    virgins in the Koran. That idea only came into being     years later  and most Islamic scholars see it as the equivalent of people with wings sitting on clouds and strumming harps. Paradise is quite the opposite. It's not virginity  it's fecundity. It's plenty. It's gardens watered by running streams. Thank you. So I am a surgeon who studies creativity  and I have never had a patient tell me that  I really want you to be creative during surgery   and so I guess there's a little bit of irony to it. I will say though that  after having done surgery a lot  it's somewhat similar to playing a musical instrument. And for me  this sort of deep and enduring fascination with sound is what led me to both be a surgeon and also to study the science of sound  particularly music. And so I'm going to try to talk to you over the next few minutes about my career in terms of how I'm able to actually try to study music and really try to grapple with all these questions of how the brain is able to be creative. I've done most of this work at Johns Hopkins University  but also at the National Institute of Health where I was previously. I'm going to go over some science experiments and try to cover three musical experiments. I'm going to start off by playing a video for you. And this video is a video of Keith Jarrett  who's a well known jazz improviser and probably the most well known  iconic example of someone who takes improvisation to a really higher level. And he'll improvise entire concerts off the top of his head  and he'll never play it exactly the same way again  and so  as a form of intense creativity  I think this is a great example. And so why don't we go and click the video. It's really a remarkable  awesome thing that happens there. I've always    just as a listener  as just a fan    I listen to that  and I'm just astounded. I think    how can this possibly be  How can the brain generate that much information  that much music  spontaneously  And so I set out with this concept  scientifically  that artistic creativity  it's magical  but it's not magic  meaning that it's a product of the brain. There's not too many brain dead people creating art. And so with this notion that artistic creativity is in fact a neurologic product  I took this thesis that we could study it just like we study any other complex neurologic process. And I think there's some sub questions there that I put there. Is it truly possible to study creativity scientifically  And I think that's a good question. And I'll tell you that most scientific studies of music  they're very dense  and when you actually go through them  it's very hard to recognize the music in it. In fact  they seem to be very unmusical entirely and to miss the whole point of the music. And so it brings the second question  Why should scientists study creativity  Maybe we're not the right people to do it. Well it may be  but I will say that  from a scientific perspective    we talked a lot about innovation today    the science of innovation  how much we understand about how the brain is able to innovate is in its infancy  and truly  we know very little about how we are able to be creative. And so I think that we're going to see over the next            years a real science of creativity that's burgeoning and is going to flourish. Because we now have new methods that can enable us to take this process of something like this  complex jazz improvisation  and study it rigorously. And so it gets down to the brain. And so all of us have this remarkable brain  which is poorly understood to say the least. I think that neuroscientists have many more questions than answers  and I myself  I'm not going to give you many answers today  just ask a lot of questions. And fundamentally that's what I do in my lab. I ask questions about what is this brain doing to enable us to do this. This is the main method that I use. This is called functional MRI. If you've been in an MRI scanner  it's very much the same  but this one is outfitted in a special way to not just take pictures of your brain  but to also take pictures of active areas of the brain. Now the way that's done is by the following. There's something called BOLD imaging  which is Blood Oxygen Level Dependent imaging. Now when you're in an fMRI scanner  you're in a big magnet that's aligning your molecules in certain areas. When an area of the brain is active  meaning a neural area is active  it gets blood flow shunted to that area. That blood flow causes an increase in local blood to that area with a deoxyhemoglobin change in concentration. Deoxyhemoglobin can be detected by MRI  whereas oxyhemoglobin can't. So through this method of inference    and we're measuring blood flow  not neural activity    we say that an area of the brain that's getting more blood was active during a particular task  and that's the crux of how fMRI works. And it's been used since the '  s to study really complex processes. Now I'm going to review a study that I did  which was jazz in an fMRI scanner. And this was done with a colleague of mine  Alan Braun  at the NIH. This is a short video of how we did this project. that we use for the jazz experiments. And it's a    key keyboard that is designed to fit both inside the scanner  be magnetically safe  have minimal interference that would contribute to any artifact and have this cushion so that it can rest on the players' legs while they're lying down in the scanner  playing on their back. And it works like this    this doesn't actually produce any sound. It sends out what's called a MIDI signal    or a Musical Instrument Digital Interface    through these wires into the box and then the computer  which then trigger high quality piano samples like this. CL  Okay  so it works. And so through this piano keyboard  we now have the means to take a musical process and study it. So what do you do now that you have this cool piano keyboard  You can't just sort of     It's great we've got this keyboard.  We actually have to come up with a scientific experiment. And so the experiment really rests on the following  What happens in the brain during something that's memorized and over learned  and what happens in the brain during something that is spontaneously generated  or improvised  in a way that's matched motorically and in terms of lower level sensory motor features  And so  I have here what we call the  paradigms.  There's a scale paradigm  which is just playing a scale up and down  memorized. And then there's improvising on a scale    quarter notes  metronome  right hand    scientifically very safe  but musically really boring. And then there's the bottom one  which is called the jazz paradigm. And so what we did was we brought professional jazz players to the NIH  and we had them memorize this piece of music on the left  the lower left    which is what you heard me playing    and then we had them improvise to the same exact chord changes. And if you can hit that lower right sound icon  that's an example of what was recorded in the scanner. So in the end  it's not the most natural environment  but they're able to play real music. And I've listened to that solo     times  and I still like it. And the musicians  they were comfortable in the end. And so we first measured the number of notes. Were they in fact just playing a lot more notes when they were improvising  That was not what was going on. And then we looked at the brain activity. I'm going to try to condense this for you. These are contrast maps that are showing subtractions between what changes when you're improvising versus when you're doing something memorized. In red is an area that active in the prefrontal cortex  the frontal lobe of the brain  and in blue is this area that was deactivated. And so we had this focal area called the medial prefrontal cortex that went way up in activity. We had this broad patch of area called the lateral prefrontal cortex that went way down in activity  and I'll summarize that for you here. Now these are multifunctional areas of the brain. As I like to say  these are not the  jazz areas  of the brain. They do a whole host of things that have to do with self reflection  introspection  working memory and so forth. Really  consciousness is seated in the frontal lobe. But we have this combination of an area that's thought to be involved in self monitoring  turning off  and this area that's thought to be autobiographical  or self expressive  turning on. And we think  at least in this preliminary    it's one study  it's probably wrong  but it's one study    we think that at least a reasonable hypothesis is that  to be creative  you have to have this weird dissociation in your frontal lobe. One area turns on  and a big area shuts off  so that you're not inhibited  so that you're willing to make mistakes  so that you're not constantly shutting down all of these new generative impulses. Now a lot of people know that music is not always a solo activity    sometimes it's done communicatively. And so the next question was  What happens when musicians are trading back and forth  something called  trading fours   which is something they do normally in a jazz experiment  So this is a twelve bar blues. And I've broken it down into four bar groups here  so you would know how you would trade. Now what we did was we brought a musician into the scanner    same way    had them memorize this melody and then had another musician out in the control room trading back and forth interactively. So this is a musician  Mike Pope  one of the world's best bassists and a fantastic piano player. So he's now playing the piece that we just saw just a little better than I wrote it. Nurse  Nothing's in your pockets  right Mike  MP  Nope. Nothing's in my pockets. Nurse  Okay. CL  You have to have the right attitude to agree to it. It's kind of fun actually. And so now we're playing back and forth. He's in there. You can see his legs up there. And then I'm in the control room here  playing back and forth. of what it's like. And it's good that it's not too quick. The fact that we do it over and over again lets you acclimate to your surroundings. So the hardest thing for me was the kinesthetic thing  of looking at my hands through two mirrors  laying on my back and not able to move at all except for my hand. That was challenging. But again  there were moments  for sure  there were moments of real  honest to God musical interplay  for sure. CL  At this point  I'll take a few moments. And so what you're seeing here    and I'm doing a cardinal sin in science  which is to show you preliminary data. This is one subject's data. This is  in fact  Mike Pope's data. So what am I showing you here  When he was trading fours with me  improvising versus memorized  his language areas lit up  his Broca's area  which is inferior frontal gyrus on the left. He actually had it also homologous on the right. This is an area thought to be involved in expressive communication. This whole notion that music is a language    well maybe there's a neurologic basis to it in fact after all  and we can see it when two musicians are having a musical conversation. And so we've done this actually on eight subjects now  and we're just getting all the data together  so hopefully we'll have something to say about it meaningfully. Now when I think about improvisation and the language  well what's next  Rap  of course  rap    free style. And so I've always been fascinated by free style. And let's go ahead and play this video here.   Rockin' it when I be  in your vicinity     Whole style synergy  recognize symmetry     Go and try to injure me  broke 'em down chemically     Ain't the number    MC  talk about how been I be     Styled it like Kennedy  late like a    to three     When I say when I be  girls say bend that key cut   CL  And so there's a lot of analogy between what takes place in free style rap and jazz. There are  in fact  a lot of correlations between the two forms of music I think in different time periods. In a lot a ways  rap serves the same social function that jazz used to serve. So how do you study rap scientifically  And my colleagues kind of think I'm crazy  but I think it's very viable. And so this is what you do  you have a free style artist come in and memorize a rap that you write for them  that they've never heard before  and then you have them free style. So I told my lab members that I would rap for TED  and they said   No  you won't.  And then I thought    But here's the thing. With this big screen  you can all rap with me. Okay  So what we had them do was memorize this lower left sound icon  please. This is the control condition. This is what they memorized. Computer    Memory  thump.   CL    Thump of the beat in a known repeat     Rhythm and rhyme  they make me complete     The climb is sublime when I'm on the mic     Spittin' rhymes that hit you like a lightning strike     I search for the truth in this eternal quest     My passion's not fashion  you can see how I'm dressed     Psychopathic words in my head appear     Whisper these lyrics only I can hear     The art of discovering and that which is hovering     Inside the mind of those unconfined     All of these words keep pouring out like rain     I need a mad scientist to check my brain   I guarantee you that will never happen again. So now  what's great about these free stylers  they will get cued different words. They don't know what's coming  but they'll hear something off the cuff. Go ahead and hit that right sound icon. They are going to be cued these three square words   like    not  and  head.  He doesn't know what's coming. Free styler    I'm like some kind of  unclear       unclear  extraterrestrial  celestial scene     Back in the days  I used to sit in pyramids and meditate     With two microphones hovering over my head     See if I could still listen  spittin' off the sound     See what you grinning     I teach the children in the back of the classroom     About the message of apocalyptical     Not really though  'cause I've got to keep it simple      unclear  instrumental     Detrimental playing Super Mario      unclear  boxes  unclear  hip hop   CL  So again  it's an incredible thing that's taking place. It's doing something that  neurologically  is remarkable. Whether or not you like the music is irrelevant. Creatively speaking  it's just a phenomenal thing. This is a short video of how we actually do this in a scanner. CL  That was recorded in the scanner  by the way. He's just memorized a rhyme for us. Emmanuel    Top of the beat with no repeat     Rhythm and rhyme make me complete     Climb is sublime when I'm on the mic     Spittin' rhymes that'll hit you like a lightning strike     I search for the truth in this eternal quest     I'm passing on fashion  you can see how I'm dressed   CL  Okay. So I'm going to stop that there. So what do we see in his brain  Well  this is actually four rappers' brains. And what we see  we do see language areas lighting up  but then    eyes closed    when you are free styling versus memorizing  you've got major visual areas lighting up. You've got major cerebellar activity  which is involved in motor coordination. You have heightened brain activity when you're doing a comparable task  when that one task is creative and the other task is memorized. It's very preliminary  but I think it's kind of cool. So just to conclude  we've got a lot of questions to ask  and like I said  we'll ask questions here  not answer them. But we want to get at the root of what is creative genius  neurologically  and I think  with these methods  we're getting close to being there. And I think hopefully in the next        years you'll actually see real  meaningful studies that say science has to catch up to art  and maybe we're starting now to get there. And so I want to thank you for your time. I appreciate it. There are two groups of women when it comes to screening mammography    women in whom mammography works very well and has saved thousands of lives and women in whom it doesn't work well at all. Do you know which group you're in  If you don't  you're not alone. Because the breast has become are very political organ. The truth has become lost in all the rhetoric coming from the press  politicians  radiologists and medical imaging companies. I will do my best this morning to tell you what I think is the truth. But first  my disclosures. I am not a breast cancer survivor. I'm not a radiologist. I don't have any patents  and I've never received any money from a medical imaging company  and I am not seeking your vote. What I am is a doctor of internal medicine who became passionately interested in this topic about    years ago when a patient asked me a question. She came to see me after discovering a breast lump. Her sister had been diagnosed with breast cancer in her   s. She and I were both very pregnant at that time  and my heart just ached for her  imagining how afraid she must be. Fortunately  her lump proved to be benign. But she asked me a question  how confident was I that I would find a tumor early on her mammogram if she developed one  So I studied her mammogram  and I reviewed the radiology literature  and I was shocked to discover that  in her case  our chances of finding a tumor early on the mammogram were less than the toss of a coin. You may recall a year ago when a firestorm erupted after the United States Preventive Services Task Force reviewed the world's mammography screening literature and issued a guideline recommending against screening mammograms in women in their   s. Now everybody rushed to criticize the Task Force  even though most of them weren't in anyway familiar with the mammography studies. It took the Senate just    days to ban the use of the guidelines in determining insurance coverage. Radiologists were outraged by the guidelines. The pre eminent mammographer in the United States issued the following quote to the Washington Post. The radiologists were  in turn  criticized for protecting their own financial self interest. But in my view  the radiologists are heroes. There's a shortage of radiologists qualified to read mammograms  and that's because mammograms are one of the most complex of all radiology studies to interpret  and because radiologists are sued more often over missed breast cancer than any other cause. But that very fact is telling. Where there is this much legal smoke  there is likely to be some fire. The factor most responsible for that fire is breast density. Breast density refers to the relative amount of fat    pictured here in yellow    versus connective and epithelial tissues    pictured in pink. And that proportion is primarily genetically determined. Two thirds of women in their   s have dense breast tissue  which is why mammography doesn't work as well in them. And although breast density generally declines with age  up to a third of women retain dense breast tissue for years after menopause. So how do you know if your breasts are dense  Well  you need to read the details of your mammography report. Radiologists classify breast density into four categories based on the appearance of the tissue on a mammogram. If the breast is less than    percent dense  that's called fatty replaced. The next category is scattered fibroglandular densities  followed by heterogeneously dense and extremely dense. And breasts that fall into these two categories are considered dense. The problem with breast density is that it's truly the wolf in sheep's clothing. Both tumors and dense breast tissue appear white on a mammogram  and the X ray often can't distinguish between the two. So it's easy to see this tumor in the upper part of this fatty breast. But imagine how difficult it would be to find that tumor in this dense breast. That's why mammograms find over    percent of tumors in fatty breasts  but as few as    percent in extremely dense breasts. Now it's bad enough that breast density makes it hard to find a cancer  but it turns out that it's also a powerful predictor of your risk for breast cancer. It's a stronger risk factor than having a mother or a sister with breast cancer. At the time my patient posed this question to me  breast density was an obscure topic in the radiology literature  and very few women having mammograms  or the physicians ordering them  knew about this. But what else could I offer her  Mammograms have been around since the     's  and it's changed very little. There have been surprisingly few innovations  until digital mammography was approved in     . Digital mammography is still an X ray of the breast  but the images can be stored and manipulated digitally  just like we can with a digital camera. The U.S. has invested four billion dollars converting to digital mammography equipment  and what have we gained from that investment  In a study funded by over    million taxpayer dollars  digital mammography was found to be no better over all than traditional mammography  and in fact  it was worse in older women. But it was better in one group  and that was women under    who were pre menopausal and had dense breasts  and in those women  digital mammography found twice as many cancers  but it still only found    percent. So digital mammography has been a giant leap forward for manufacturers of digital mammography equipment  but it's been a very small step forward for womankind. What about ultrasound  Ultrasound generates more biopsies that are unnecessary relative to other technologies  so it's not widely used. And MRI is exquisitely sensitive for finding tumors  but it's also very expensive. If we think about disruptive technology  we see an almost ubiquitous pattern of the technology getting smaller and less expensive. Think about iPods compared to stereos. But it's the exact opposite in health care. The machines get ever bigger and ever more expensive. Screening the average young woman with an MRI is kind of like driving to the grocery store in a Hummer. It's just way too much equipment. One MRI scan costs    times what a digital mammogram costs. And sooner or later  we're going to have to accept the fact that health care innovation can't always come at a much higher price. Malcolm Gladwell wrote an article in the New Yorker on innovation  and he made the case that scientific discoveries are rarely the product of one individual's genius. Rather  big ideas can be orchestrated  if you can simply gather people with different perspectives in a room and get them to talk about things that they don't ordinarily talk about. It's like the essence of TED. He quotes one innovator who says   The only time a physician and a physicist get together is when the physicist gets sick.  This makes no sense  because physicians have all kinds of problems that they don't realize have solutions. And physicists have all kinds of solutions for things that they don't realize are problems. Now  take a look at this cartoon that accompanied Gladwell's article  and tell me if you see something disturbing about this depiction of innovative thinkers. So if you will allow me a little creative license  I will tell you the story of the serendipitous collision of my patient's problem with a physicist's solution. Shortly after her visit  I was introduced to a nuclear physicist at Mayo named Michael O'Conner  who was a specialist in cardiac imaging  something I had nothing to do with. And he happened to tell me about a conference he'd just returned from in Israel  where they were talking about a new type of gamma detector. Now gamma imaging has been around for a long time to image the heart  and it had even been tried to image the breast. But the problem was that the gamma detectors were these huge  bulky tubes  and they were filled with these scintillating crystals  and you just couldn't get them close enough around the breast to find small tumors. But the potential advantage was that gamma rays  unlike X rays  are not influenced by breast density. But this technology could not find tumors when they're small  and finding a small tumor is critical for survival. If you can find a tumor when it's less than a centimeter  survival exceeds    percent  but drops off rapidly as tumor size increases. But Michael told me about a new type of gamma detector that he'd seen  and this is it. It's made not of a bulky tube  but of a thin layer of a semiconductor material that serves as the gamma detector. And I started talking to him about this problem with breast density  and we realized that we might be able to get this detector close enough around the breast to actually find small tumors. So after putting together a grid of these cubes with tape       Michael hacked off the X ray plate of a mammography machine that was about to be thrown out  and we attached the new detector  and we decided to call this machine Molecular Breast Imaging  or MBI. This is an image from our first patient. And you can see  using the old gamma technology  that it just looked like noise. But using our new detector  we could begin to see the outline of a tumor. So here we were  a nuclear physicist  an internist  soon joined by Carrie Hruska  a biomedical engineer  and two radiologists  and we were trying to take on the entrenched world of mammography with a machine that was held together by duct tape. To say that we faced high doses of skepticism in those early years is just a huge understatement  but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work that we chipped away with incremental modifications to this system. This is our current detector. And you can see that it looks a lot different. The duct tape is gone  and we added a second detector on top of the breast  which has further improved our tumor detection. So how does this work  The patient receives an injection of a radio tracer that's taken up by rapidly proliferating tumor cells  but not by normal cells  and this is the key difference from mammography. Mammography relies on differences in the appearance of the tumor from the background tissue  and we've seen that those differences can be obscured in a dense breast. But MBI exploits the different molecular behavior of tumors  and therefore  it's impervious to breast density. After the injection  the patient's breast is placed between the detectors. And if you've ever had a mammogram    if you're old enough to have had a mammogram    you know what comes next  pain. You may be surprised to know that mammography is the only radiologic study that's regulated by federal law  and the law requires that the equivalent of a    pound car battery come down on your breast during this study. But with MBI  we use just light  pain free compression. And the detector then transmits the image to the computer. So here's an example. You can see  on the right  a mammogram showing a faint tumor  the edges of which are blurred by the dense tissue. But the MBI image shows that tumor much more clearly  as well as a second tumor  which profoundly influence that patient's surgical options. In this example  although the mammogram found one tumor  we were able to demonstrate three discrete tumors    one is small as three millimeters. Our big break came in     . After we had demonstrated that we could find small tumors  we used these images to submit a grant to the Susan G. Komen Foundation. And we were elated when they took a chance on a team of completely unknown investigators and funded us to study       women with dense breasts  comparing a screening mammogram to an MBI. Of the tumors that we found  mammography found only    percent of those tumors. MBI found    percent. Here's an example from that screening study. The digital mammogram was read as normal and shows lots of dense tissue  but the MBI shows an area of intense uptake  which correlated with a two centimeter tumor. In this case  a one centimeter tumor. And in this case  a    year old medical secretary at Mayo  who had lost her mother to breast cancer when she was very young  wanted to enroll in our study. And her mammogram showed an area of very dense tissue  but her MBI showed an area of worrisome uptake  which we can also see on a color image. And this corresponded to a tumor the size of a golf ball. But fortunately it was removed before it had spread to her lymph nodes. So now that we knew that this technology could find three times more tumors in a dense breast  we had to solve one very important problem. We had to figure out how to lower the radiation dose  and we have spent the last three years making modifications to every aspect of the imaging system to allow this. And I'm very happy to report that we're now using a dose of radiation that is equivalent to the effective dose from one digital mammogram. And at this low dose  we're continuing this screening study  and this image from three weeks ago in a    year old woman shows a normal digital mammogram  but an MBI image showing an uptake that proved to be a large cancer. So this is not just young women that it's benefiting. It's also older women with dense tissue. And we're now routinely using one fifth the radiation dose that's used in any other type of gamma technology. MBI generates four images per breast. MRI generates over a thousand. It takes a radiologist years of specialty training to become expert in differentiating the normal anatomic detail from the worrisome finding. But I suspect even the non radiologists in the room can find the tumor on the MBI image. But this is why MBI is so potentially disruptive    it's as accurate as MRI  it's far less complex to interpret  and it's a fraction of the cost. But you can understand why there may be forces in the breast imaging world who prefer the status quo. After achieving what we felt were remarkable results  our manuscript was rejected by four journals. After the fourth rejection  we requested reconsideration of the manuscript  because we strongly suspected that one of the reviewers who had rejected it had a financial conflict of interest in a competing technology. Our manuscript was then accepted and will be published later this month in the journal Radiology. We still need to complete the screening study using the low dose  and then our findings will need to be replicated at other institutions  and this could take five or more years. If this technology is widely adopted  I will not benefit financially in any way  and that is very important to me  because it allows me to continue to tell you the truth. But I recognize    I recognize that the adoption of this technology will depend as much on economic and political forces as it will on the soundness of the science. The MBI unit has now been FDA approved  but it's not yet widely available. So until something is available for women with dense breasts  there are things that you should know to protect yourself. First  know your density. Ninety percent of women don't  and    percent of women don't know that it increases your breast cancer risk. The State of Connecticut became the first and only state to mandate that women receive notification of their breast density after a mammogram. I was at a conference of        people in breast imaging last week in Chicago  and I was stunned that there was a heated debate as to whether we should be telling women what their breast density is. Of course we should. And if you don't know  please ask your doctor or read the details of your mammography report. Second  if you're pre menopausal  try to schedule your mammogram in the first two weeks of your menstrual cycle  when breast density is relatively lower. Third  if you notice a persistent change in your breast  insist on additional imaging. And fourth and most important  the mammography debate will rage on  but I do believe that all women    and older should have an annual mammogram. Mammography isn't perfect  but it's the only test that's been proven to reduce mortality from breast cancer. But this mortality banner is the very sword which mammography's most ardent advocates use to deter innovation. Some women who develop breast cancer die from it many years later  and most women  thankfully  survive. So it takes    or more years for any screening method to demonstrate a reduction in mortality from breast cancer. Mammography's the only one that's been around long enough to have a chance of making that claim. It is time for us to accept both the extraordinary successes of mammography and the limitations. We need to individualize screening based on density. For women without dense breasts  mammography is the best choice. But for women with dense breasts  we shouldn't abandon screening altogether  we need to offer them something better. The babies that we were carrying when my patient first asked me this question are now both in middle school  and the answer has been so slow to come. She's given me her blessing to share this story with you. After undergoing biopsies that further increased her risk for cancer and losing her sister to cancer  she made the difficult decision to have a prophylactic mastectomy. We can and must do better  not just in time for her granddaughters and my daughters  but in time for you. Thank you. So the Awesome story  It begins about    years ago  when my mom and my dad came to Canada. My mom left Nairobi  Kenya. My dad left a small village outside of Amritsar  India. And they got here in the late     s. They settled in a shady suburb about an hour east of Toronto  and they settled into a new life. They saw their first dentist  they ate their first hamburger  and they had their first kids. My sister and I grew up here  and we had quiet  happy childhoods. We had close family  good friends  a quiet street. We grew up taking for granted a lot of the things that my parents couldn't take for granted when they grew up    things like power always on in our houses  things like schools across the street and hospitals down the road and popsicles in the backyard. We grew up  and we grew older. I went to high school. I graduated. I moved out of the house  I got a job  I found a girl  I settled down    and I realize it sounds like a bad sitcom or a Cat Stevens' song    but life was pretty good. Life was pretty good.      was a great year. Under clear blue skies in July in the wine region of Ontario  I got married  surrounded by     family and friends.      was a great year. I graduated from school  and I went on a road trip with two of my closest friends. Here's a picture of me and my friend  Chris  on the coast of the Pacific Ocean. We actually saw seals out of our car window  and we pulled over to take a quick picture of them and then blocked them with our giant heads. So you can't actually see them  but it was breathtaking  believe me.      and      were a little tougher. I know that they were tougher for a lot of people  not just me. First of all  the news was so heavy. It's still heavy now  and it was heavy before that  but when you flipped open a newspaper  when you turned on the TV  it was about ice caps melting  wars going on around the world  earthquakes  hurricanes and an economy that was wobbling on the brink of collapse  and then eventually did collapse  and so many of us losing our homes  or our jobs  or our retirements  or our livelihoods.            were heavy years for me for another reason  too. I was going through a lot of personal problems at the time. My marriage wasn't going well  and we just were growing further and further apart. One day my wife came home from work and summoned the courage  through a lot of tears  to have a very honest conversation. And she said   I don't love you anymore   and it was one of the most painful things I'd ever heard and certainly the most heartbreaking thing I'd ever heard  until only a month later  when I heard something even more heartbreaking. My friend Chris  who I just showed you a picture of  had been battling mental illness for some time. And for those of you whose lives have been touched by mental illness  you know how challenging it can be. I spoke to him on the phone at       p.m. on a Sunday night. We talked about the TV show we watched that evening. And Monday morning  I found out that he disappeared. Very sadly  he took his own life. And it was a really heavy time. And as these dark clouds were circling me  and I was finding it really  really difficult to think of anything good  I said to myself that I really needed a way to focus on the positive somehow. So I came home from work one night  and I logged onto the computer  and I started up a tiny website called     awesomethings.com. I was trying to remind myself of the simple  universal  little pleasures that we all love  but we just don't talk about enough    things like waiters and waitresses who bring you free refills without asking  being the first table to get called up to the dinner buffet at a wedding  wearing warm underwear from just out of the dryer  or when cashiers open up a new check out lane at the grocery store and you get to be first in line    even if you were last at the other line  swoop right in there. And slowly over time  I started putting myself in a better mood. I mean         blogs are started a day  and so my blog was just one of those       . And nobody read it except for my mom. Although I should say that my traffic did skyrocket and go up by     percent when she forwarded it to my dad. And then I got excited when it started getting tens of hits  and then I started getting excited when it started getting dozens and then hundreds and then thousands and then millions. It started getting bigger and bigger and bigger. And then I got a phone call  and the voice at the other end of the line said   You've just won the Best Blog In the World award.  I was like  that sounds totally fake. Which African country do you want me to wire all my money to  But it turns out  I jumped on a plane  and I ended up walking a red carpet between Sarah Silverman and Jimmy Fallon and Martha Stewart. And I went onstage to accept a Webby award for Best Blog. And the surprise and just the amazement of that was only overshadowed by my return to Toronto  when  in my inbox     literary agents were waiting for me to talk about putting this into a book. Flash forward to the next year and  The Book of Awesome  has now been number one on the bestseller list for    straight weeks. But look  I said I wanted to do three things with you today. I said I wanted to tell you the Awesome story  I wanted to share with you the three As of Awesome  and I wanted to leave you with a closing thought. So let's talk about those three As. Over the last few years  I haven't had that much time to really think. But lately I have had the opportunity to take a step back and ask myself   What is it over the last few years that helped me grow my website  but also grow myself   And I've summarized those things  for me personally  as three As. They are Attitude  Awareness and Authenticity. I'd love to just talk about each one briefly. So Attitude  Look  we're all going to get lumps  and we're all going to get bumps. None of us can predict the future  but we do know one thing about it and that's that it ain't gonna go according to plan. We will all have high highs and big days and proud moments of smiles on graduation stages  father daughter dances at weddings and healthy babies screeching in the delivery room  but between those high highs  we may also have some lumps and some bumps too. It's sad  and it's not pleasant to talk about  but your husband might leave you  your girlfriend could cheat  your headaches might be more serious than you thought  or your dog could get hit by a car on the street. It's not a happy thought  but your kids could get mixed up in gangs or bad scenes. Your mom could get cancer  your dad could get mean. And there are times in life when you will be tossed in the well  too  with twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart  and when that bad news washes over you  and when that pain sponges and soaks in  I just really hope you feel like you've always got two choices. One  you can swirl and twirl and gloom and doom forever  or two  you can grieve and then face the future with newly sober eyes. Having a great attitude is about choosing option number two  and choosing  no matter how difficult it is  no matter what pain hits you  choosing to move forward and move on and take baby steps into the future. The second  A  is Awareness. I love hanging out with three year olds. I love the way that they see the world  because they're seeing the world for the first time. I love the way that they can stare at a bug crossing the sidewalk. I love the way that they'll stare slack jawed at their first baseball game with wide eyes and a mitt on their hand  soaking in the crack of the bat and the crunch of the peanuts and the smell of the hotdogs. I love the way that they'll spend hours picking dandelions in the backyard and putting them into a nice centerpiece for Thanksgiving dinner. I love the way that they see the world  because they're seeing the world for the first time. Having a sense of awareness is just about embracing your inner three year old. Because you all used to be three years old. That three year old boy is still part of you. That three year old girl is still part of you. They're in there. And being aware is just about remembering that you saw everything you've seen for the first time once  too. So there was a time when it was your first time ever hitting a string of green lights on the way home from work. There was the first time you walked by the open door of a bakery and smelt the bakery air  or the first time you pulled a    dollar bill out of your old jacket pocket and said   Found money.  The last  A  is Authenticity. And for this one  I want to tell you a quick story. Let's go all the way back to      when  on a peanut farm in Georgia  a little baby boy named Roosevelt Grier was born. Roosevelt Grier  or Rosey Grier  as people used to call him  grew up and grew into a     pound  six foot five linebacker in the NFL. He's number    in the picture. Here he is pictured with the  fearsome foursome.  These were four guys on the L.A. Rams in the     s you did not want to go up against. They were tough football players doing what they love  which was crushing skulls and separating shoulders on the football field. But Rosey Grier also had another passion. In his deeply authentic self  he also loved needlepoint.  Laughter  He loved knitting. He said that it calmed him down  it relaxed him  it took away his fear of flying and helped him meet chicks. That's what he said. I mean  he loved it so much that  after he retired from the NFL  he started joining clubs. And he even put out a book called  Rosey Grier's Needlepoint for Men.  It's a great cover. If you notice  he's actually needlepointing his own face. And so what I love about this story is that Rosey Grier is just such an authentic person  and that's what authenticity is all about. It's just about being you and being cool with that. And I think when you're authentic  you end up following your heart  and you put yourself in places and situations and in conversations that you love and that you enjoy. You meet people that you like talking to. You go places you've dreamt about. And you end you end up following your heart and feeling very fulfilled. So those are the three A's. For the closing thought  I want to take you all the way back to my parents coming to Canada. I don't know what it would feel like coming to a new country when you're in your mid   s. I don't know  because I never did it  but I would imagine that it would take a great attitude. I would imagine that you'd have to be pretty aware of your surroundings and appreciating the small wonders that you're starting to see in your new world. And I think you'd have to be really authentic  you'd have to be really true to yourself in order to get through what you're being exposed to. I'd like to pause my TEDTalk for about    seconds right now  because you don't get many opportunities in life to do something like this  and my parents are sitting in the front row. So I wanted to ask them to  if they don't mind  stand up. And I just wanted to say thank you to you guys. When I was growing up  my dad used to love telling the story of his first day in Canada. And it's a great story  because what happened was he got off the plane at the Toronto airport  and he was welcomed by a non profit group  which I'm sure someone in this room runs. And this non profit group had a big welcoming lunch for all the new immigrants to Canada. And my dad says he got off the plane and he went to this lunch and there was this huge spread. There was bread  there was those little  mini dill pickles  there was olives  those little white onions. There was rolled up turkey cold cuts  rolled up ham cold cuts  rolled up roast beef cold cuts and little cubes of cheese. There was tuna salad sandwiches and egg salad sandwiches and salmon salad sandwiches. There was lasagna  there was casseroles  there was brownies  there was butter tarts  and there was pies  lots and lots of pies. And when my dad tells the story  he says   The craziest thing was  I'd never seen any of that before  except bread. I didn't know what was meat  what was vegetarian. I was eating olives with pie. I just couldn't believe how many things you can get here.  When I was five years old  my dad used to take me grocery shopping  and he would stare in wonder at the little stickers that are on the fruits and vegetables. He would say   Look  can you believe they have a mango here from Mexico  They've got an apple here from South Africa. Can you believe they've got a date from Morocco   He's like   Do you know where Morocco even is   And I'd say   I'm five. I don't even know where I am. Is this A P   And he'd say   I don't know where Morocco is either  but let's find out.  And so we'd buy the date  and we'd go home. And we'd actually take an atlas off the shelf  and we'd flip through until we found this mysterious country. And when we did  my dad would say   Can you believe someone climbed a tree over there  picked this thing off it  put it in a truck  drove it all the way to the docks and then sailed it all the way across the Atlantic Ocean and then put it in another truck and drove that all the way to a tiny grocery store just outside our house  so they could sell it to us for    cents   And I'd say   I don't believe that.  And he's like   I don't believe it either. Things are amazing. There's just so many things to be happy about.  When I stop to think about it  he's absolutely right. There are so many things to be happy about. We are the only species on the only life giving rock in the entire universe that we've ever seen  capable of experiencing so many of these things. I mean  we're the only ones with architecture and agriculture. We're the only ones with jewelry and democracy. We've got airplanes  highway lanes  interior design and horoscope signs. We've got fashion magazines  house party scenes. You can watch a horror movie with monsters. You can go to a concert and hear guitars jamming. We've got books  buffets and radio waves  wedding brides and rollercoaster rides. You can sleep in clean sheets. You can go to the movies and get good seats. You can smell bakery air  walk around with rain hair  pop bubble wrap or take an illegal nap. We've got all that  but we've only got     years to enjoy it. And that's the sad part. The cashiers at your grocery store  the foreman at your plant  the guy tailgating you home on the highway  the telemarketer calling you during dinner  every teacher you've ever had  everyone that's ever woken up beside you  every politician in every country  every actor in every movie  every single person in your family  everyone you love  everyone in this room and you will be dead in a hundred years. Life is so great that we only get such a short time to experience and enjoy all those tiny little moments that make it so sweet. And that moment is right now  and those moments are counting down  and those moments are always  always  always fleeting. You will never be as young as you are right now. And that's why I believe that if you live your life with a great attitude  choosing to move forward and move on whenever life deals you a blow  living with a sense of awareness of the world around you  embracing your inner three year old and seeing the tiny joys that make life so sweet and being authentic to yourself  being you and being cool with that  letting your heart lead you and putting yourself in experiences that satisfy you  then I think you'll live a life that is rich and is satisfying  and I think you'll live a life that is truly awesome. Thank you. I'm actually here to make a challenge to people. I know there have been many challenges made to people. The one I'm going to make is that it is time for us to reclaim what peace really means. Peace is not  Kumbaya  my Lord.  Peace is not the dove and the rainbow    as lovely as they are. When I see the symbols of the rainbow and the dove  I think of personal serenity. I think of meditation. I do not think about what I consider to be peace  which is sustainable peace with justice and equality. It is a sustainable peace in which the majority of people on this planet have access to enough resources to live dignified lives  where these people have enough access to education and health care  so that they can live in freedom from want and freedom from fear. This is called human security. And I am not a complete pacifist like some of my really  really heavy duty  non violent friends  like Mairead McGuire. I understand that humans are so  messed up     to use a nice word  because I promised my mom I'd stop using the F bomb in public. And I'm trying harder and harder. Mom  I'm really trying. We need a little bit of police  we need a little bit of military  but for defense. We need to redefine what makes us secure in this world. It is not arming our country to the teeth. It is not getting other countries to arm themselves to the teeth with the weapons that we produce and we sell them. It is using that money more rationally to make the countries of the world secure  to make the people of the world secure. I was thinking about the recent ongoings in Congress  where the president is offering  .  billion dollars to try to get the START vote. I certainly support the START vote. But he's offering    billion dollars for the modernizing of nuclear weapons. Do you know the figure that the U.N. talks about for fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals is    billion dollars  Just that little bit of money  which to me  I wish it was in my bank account    it's not  but ... In global terms  it's a little bit of money. But it's going to modernize weapons we do not need and will not be gotten rid of in our lifetime  unless we get up off our ... and take action to make it happen  unless we begin to believe that all of the things that we've been hearing about in these last two days are elements of what come together to make human security. It is saving the tigers. It is stopping the tar sands. It is having access to medical equipment that can actually tell who does have cancer. It is all of those things. It is using our money for all of those things. It is about action. I was in Hiroshima a couple of weeks ago  and His Holiness    we're sitting there in front of thousands of people in the city  and there were about eight of us Nobel laureates. And he's a bad guy. He's like a bad kid in church. We're staring at everybody  waiting our turn to speak  and he leans over to me  and he says   Jody  I'm a Buddhist monk.  I said   Yes  Your Holiness. Your robe gives it away.  He said   You know that I kind of like meditation  and I pray.  I said   That's good. That's good. We need that in the world. I don't follow that  but that's cool.  And he says   But I have become skeptical. I do not believe that meditation and prayer will change this world. I think what we need is action.  His Holiness  in his robes  is my new action hero. I spoke with Aung Sun Suu Kyi a couple of days ago. As most of you know  she's a hero for democracy in her country  Burma. You probably also know that she has spent    of the last    years imprisoned for her efforts to bring about democracy. She was just released a couple of weeks ago  and we're very concerned to see how long she will be free  because she is already out in the streets in Rangoon  agitating for change. She is already out in the streets  working with the party to try to rebuild it. But I talked to her for a range of issues. But one thing that I want to say  because it's similar to what His Holiness said. She said   You know  we have a long road to go to finally get democracy in my country. But I don't believe in hope without endeavor. I don't believe in the hope of change  unless we take action to make it so.  Here's another woman hero of mine. She's my friend  Dr. Shirin Ebadi  the first Muslim woman to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. She has been in exile for the last year and a half. You ask her where she lives    where does she live in exile  She says the airports of the world. She is traveling because she was out of the country at the time of the elections. And instead of going home  she conferred with all the other women that she works with  who said to her   Stay out. We need you out. We need to be able to talk to you out there  so that you can give the message of what's happening here.  A year and a half    she's out speaking on behalf of the other women in her country. Wangari Maathai         Peace laureate. They call her the  Tree Lady   but she's more than the Tree Lady. Working for peace is very creative. It's hard work every day. When she was planting those trees  I don't think most people understand that  at the same time  she was using the action of getting people together to plant those trees to talk about how to overcome the authoritarian government in her country. People could not gather without getting busted and taken to jail. But if they were together planting trees for the environment  it was okay    creativity. But it's not just iconic women like Shirin  like Aung Sun Suu Kyi  like Wangari Maathai    it is other women in the world who are also struggling together to change this world. The Women's League of Burma     individual organizations of Burmese women came together because there's strength in numbers. Working together is what changes our world. The Million Signatures Campaign of women inside Burma working together to change human rights  to bring democracy to that country. When one is arrested and taken to prison  another one comes out and joins the movement  recognizing that if they work together  they will ultimately bring change in their own country. Mairead McGuire in the middle  Betty Williams on the right hand side    bringing peace to Northern Ireland. I'll tell you the quick story. An IRA driver was shot  and his car plowed into people on the side of the street. There was a mother and three children. The children were killed on the spot. It was Mairead's sister. Instead of giving in to grief  depression  defeat in the face of that violence  Mairead hooked up with Betty    a staunch Protestant and a staunch Catholic    and they took to the streets to say   No more violence.  And they were able to get tens of thousands of  primarily  women  some men  in the streets to bring about change. And they have been part of what brought peace to Northern Ireland  and they're still working on it  because there's still a lot more to do. This is Rigoberta Menchu Tum. She also received the Peace Prize. She is now running for president. She is educating the indigenous people of her country about what it means to be a democracy  about how you bring democracy to the country  about educating  about how to vote    but that democracy is not just about voting  it's about being an active citizen. That's what I got stuck doing    the landmine campaign. One of the things that made this campaign work is because we grew from two NGOs to thousands in    countries around the world  working together in common cause to ban landmines. Some of the people who worked in our campaign could only work maybe an hour a month. They could maybe volunteer that much. There were others  like myself  who were full time. But it was the actions  together  of all of us that brought about that change. In my view  what we need today is people getting up and taking action to reclaim the meaning of peace. It's not a dirty word. It's hard work every single day. And if each of us who cares about the different things we care about got up off our butts and volunteered as much time as we could  we would change this world  we would save this world. And we can't wait for the other guy. We have to do it ourselves. Thank you. I would like to tell you all that you are all actually cyborgs  but not the cyborgs that you think. You're not RoboCop  and you're not Terminator  but you're cyborgs every time you look at a computer screen or use one of your cell phone devices. So what's a good definition for cyborg  Well  traditional definition is  an organism to which exogenous components have been added for the purpose of adapting to new environments.  That came from a      paper on space travel  because  if you think about it  space is pretty awkward. People aren't supposed to be there. But humans are curious  and they like to add things to their bodies so they can go to the Alps one day and then become a fish in the sea the next. So let's look at the concept of traditional anthropology. Somebody goes to another country  says   How fascinating these people are  how interesting their tools are  how curious their culture is.  And then they write a paper  and maybe a few other anthropologists read it  and we think it's very exotic. Well  what's happening is that we've suddenly found a new species. I  as a cyborg anthropologist  have suddenly said   Oh  wow. Now suddenly we're a new form of Homo sapiens  and look at these fascinating cultures  and look at these curious rituals that everybody's doing around this technology. They're clicking on things and staring at screens.  Now there's a reason why I study this  versus traditional anthropology. And the reason is that tool use  in the beginning    for thousands and thousands of years  everything has been a physical modification of self. It has helped us to extend our physical selves  go faster  hit things harder  and there's been a limit on that. But now what we're looking at is not an extension of the physical self  but an extension of the mental self  and because of that  we're able to travel faster  communicate differently. And the other thing that happens is that we're all carrying around little Mary Poppins technology. We can put anything we want into it  and it doesn't get heavier  and then we can take anything out. What does the inside of your computer actually look like  Well  if you print it out  it looks like a thousand pounds of material that you're carrying around all the time. And if you actually lose that information  it means that you suddenly have this loss in your mind  that you suddenly feel like something's missing  except you aren't able to see it  so it feels like a very strange emotion. The other thing that happens is that you have a second self. Whether you like it or not  you're starting to show up online  and people are interacting with your second self when you're not there. And so you have to be careful about leaving your front lawn open  which is basically your Facebook wall  so that people don't write on it in the middle of the night    because it's very much the equivalent. And suddenly we have to start to maintain our second self. You have to present yourself in digital life in a similar way that you would in your analog life. So  in the same way that you wake up  take a shower and get dressed  you have to learn to do that for your digital self. And the problem is that a lot of people now  especially adolescents  have to go through two adolescences. They have to go through their primary one  that's already awkward  and then they go through their second self's adolescence  and that's even more awkward because there's an actual history of what they've gone through online. And anybody coming in new to technology is an adolescent online right now  and so it's very awkward  and it's very difficult for them to do those things. So when I was little  my dad would sit me down at night and he would say   I'm going to teach you about time and space in the future.  And I said   Great.  And he said one day   What's the shortest distance between two points   And I said   Well  that's a straight line. You told me that yesterday.  I thought I was very clever. He said   No  no  no. Here's a better way.  He took a piece of paper  drew A and B on one side and the other and folded them together so where A and B touched. And he said   That is the shortest distance between two points.  And I said   Dad  dad  dad  how do you do that   He said   Well  you just bend time and space  it takes an awful lot of energy  and that's just how you do it.  And I said   I want to do that.  And he said   Well  okay.  And so  when I went to sleep for the next    or    years  I was thinking at night   I want to be the first person to create a wormhole  to make things accelerate faster. And I want to make a time machine.  I was always sending messages to my future self using tape recorders. But then what I realized when I went to college is that technology doesn't just get adopted because it works. It gets adopted because people use it and it's made for humans. So I started studying anthropology. And when I was writing my thesis on cell phones  I realized that everyone was carrying around wormholes in their pockets. They weren't physically transporting themselves  they were mentally transporting themselves. They would click on a button  and they would be connected as A to B immediately. And I thought   Oh  wow. I found it. This is great.  So over time  time and space have compressed because of this. You can stand on one side of the world  whisper something and be heard on the other. One of the other ideas that comes around is that you have a different type of time on every single device that you use. Every single browser tab gives you a different type of time. And because of that  you start to dig around for your external memories    where did you leave them  So now we're all these paleontologists that are digging for things that we've lost on our external brains that we're carrying around in our pockets. And that incites a sort of panic architecture     Oh no  where's this thing   We're all  I Love Lucy  on a great assembly line of information  and we can't keep up. And so what happens is  when we bring all that into the social space  we end up checking our phones all the time. So we have this thing called ambient intimacy. It's not that we're always connected to everybody  but at anytime we can connect to anyone we want. And if you were able to print out everybody in your cell phone  the room would be very crowded. These are the people that you have access to right now  in general    all of these people  all of your friends and family that you can connect to. And so there are some psychological effects that happen with this. One I'm really worried about is that people aren't taking time for mental reflection anymore  and that they aren't slowing down and stopping  being around all those people in the room all the time that are trying to compete for their attention on the simultaneous time interfaces  paleontology and panic architecture. They're not just sitting there. And really  when you have no external input  that is a time when there is a creation of self  when you can do long term planning  when you can try and figure out who you really are. And then  once you do that  you can figure out how to present your second self in a legitimate way  instead of just dealing with everything as it comes in    and oh  I have to do this  and I have to do this  and I have to do this. And so this is very important. I'm really worried that  especially kids today  they're not going to be dealing with this down time  that they have an instantaneous button clicking culture  and that everything comes to them  and that they become very excited about it and very addicted to it. So if you think about it  the world hasn't stopped either. It has its own external prosthetic devices  and these devices are helping us all to communicate and interact with each other. But when you actually visualize it  all the connections that we're doing right now    this is an image of the mapping of the Internet    it doesn't look technological. It actually looks very organic. This is the first time in the entire history of humanity that we've connected in this way. And it's not that machines are taking over. It's that they're helping us to be more human  helping us to connect with each other. The most successful technology gets out of the way and helps us live our lives. And really  it ends up being more human than technology  because we're co creating each other all the time. And so this is the important point that I like to study  that things are beautiful  that it's still a human connection    it's just done in a different way. We're just increasing our humanness and our ability to connect with each other  regardless of geography. So that's why I study cyborg anthropology. Thank you. If we look around us  much of what surrounds us started life as various rocks and sludge buried in the ground in various places in the world. But  of course  they don't look like rocks and sludge now. They look like TV cameras  monitors  annoying radio mics. And so this magical transformation is what I was trying to get at with my project  which became known as the Toaster Project. And it was also inspired by this quote from Douglas Adams  and the situation is from  The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  And the situation it describes is the hero of the book    he's a   th century man    finds himself alone on a strange planet populated only by a technologically primitive people. And he kind of assumes that  yes  he'll become    these villagers    he'll become their emperor and transform their society with his wonderful command of technology and science and the elements  but  of course  realizes that without the rest of human society  he can barely make a sandwich  let alone a toaster. But he didn't have Wikipedia. So I thought  okay  I'll try and make an electric toaster from scratch. And  working on the idea that the cheapest electric toaster would also be the simplest to reverse engineer  I went and bought the cheapest toaster I could find  took it home and was kind of dismayed to discover that  inside this object  which I'd bought for just  .   pounds  there were     different bits made out of a hundred plus different materials. I didn't have the rest of my life to do this project. I had maybe nine months. So I thought  okay  I'll start with five. And these were steel  mica  plastic  copper and nickel. So  starting with steel  how do you make steel  I went and knocked on the door of the Rio Tinto Chair of Advanced Mineral Extraction at the Royal School of Mines and said   How do you make steel   And Professor Cilliers was very kind and talked me through it. And my vague rememberings from GCSE science    well  steel comes from iron  so I phoned up an iron mine. And said   Hi  I'm trying to make a toaster. Can I come up and get some iron   Unfortunately  when I got there    emerges Ray. He had misheard me and thought I was coming up because I was trying to make a poster  and so wasn't prepared to take me into the mines. But after some nagging  I got him to do that. and that was produced by sea creatures     million years ago in a nice  warm  sunny atmosphere. When you study geology  you can see what's happened in the past  and there were terrific changes in the earth. Thomas Thwaites  As you can see  they had the Christmas decorations up. And of course  it wasn't actually a working mine anymore  because  though Ray was a miner there  the mine had closed and had been reopened as a kind of tourist attraction  because  of course  it can't compete on the scale of operations which are happening in South America  Australia  wherever. But anyway  I got my suitcase of iron ore and dragged it back to London on the train  and then was faced with the problem  Okay  how do you make this rock into components for a toaster  So I went back to Professor Cilliers  and he said   Go to the library.  So I did and was looking through the undergraduate textbooks on metallurgy    completely useless for what I was trying to do. Because  of course  they don't actually tell you how to do it if you want to do it yourself and you don't have a smelting plant. So I ended up going to the History of Science Library and looking at this book. This is the first textbook on metallurgy written in the West  at least. And there you can see that woodcut is basically what I ended up doing. But instead of a bellows  I had a leaf blower. And that was something that reoccurred throughout the project  was  the smaller the scale you want to work on  the further back in time you have to go. And so this is after a day and about half a night smelting this iron. I dragged out this stuff  and it wasn't iron. But luckily  I found a patent online for industrial furnaces that use microwaves  and at    minutes at full power  and I was able to finish off the process. So  my next    The next thing I was trying to get was copper. Again  this mine was once the largest copper mine in the world. It's not anymore  but I found a retired geology professor to take me down  and he said   Okay  I'll let you have some water from the mine.  And the reason I was interested in getting water is because water which goes through mines becomes kind of acidic and will start picking up  dissolving the minerals from the mine. And a good example of this is the Rio Tinto  which is in Portugal. As you can see  it's got lots and lots of minerals dissolved in it. So many such that it's now just a home for bacteria who really like acidic  toxic conditions. But anyway  the water I dragged back from the Isle of Anglesey where the mine was    there was enough copper in it such that I could cast the pins of my metal electric plug. So my next thing  I was off to Scotland to get mica. And mica is a mineral which is a very good insulator and very good at insulating electricity. That's me getting mica. And the last material I'm going to talk about today is plastic  and  of course  my toaster had to have a plastic case. Plastic is the defining feature of cheap electrical goods. And so plastic comes from oil  so I phoned up BP and spent a good half an hour trying to convince the PR office at BP that it would be fantastic for them if they flew me to an oil rig and let me have a jug of oil. BP obviously has a bit more on their mind now. But even then they weren't convinced and said   Okay  we'll phone you back     never did. So I looked at other ways of making plastic. And you can actually make plastic from obviously oils which come from plants  but also from starches. So this is attempting to make potato starch plastic. And for a while that was looking really good. I poured it into the mold  which you can see there  which I've made from a tree trunk. And it was looking good for a while  but I left it outside  because you had to leave it outside to dry  and unfortunately I came back and there were snails eating the unhydrolyzed bits of potato. So kind of out of desperation  I decided that I could think laterally. And geologists have actually christened    well  they're debating whether to christen    the age that we're living in    they're debating whether to make it a new geological epoch called the Anthropocene  the age of Man. And that's because geologists of the future would kind of see a sharp shift in the strata of rock that is being laid down now. So suddenly  it will become kind of radioactive from Chernobyl and the       or so nuclear bombs that have been set off since     . And there'd also be an extinction event    like fossils would suddenly disappear. And also  I thought that there would be synthetic polymers  plastics  embedded in the rock. So I looked up a plastic    so I decided that I could mine some of this modern day rock. And I went up to Manchester to visit a place called Axion Recycling. And they're at the sharp end of what's called the WEEE  which is this European electrical and electronic waste directive. And that was brought into force to try and deal with the mountain of stuff that is just being made and then living for a while in our homes and then going to landfill. But this is it. So there's a picture of my toaster. That's it without the case on. And there it is on the shelves. Thanks. Bruno Giussani  I'm told you did plug it in once. TT  Yeah  I did plug it in. I don't know if you could see  but I was never able to make insulation for the wires. Kew Gardens were insistent that I couldn't come and hack into their rubber tree. So the wires were uninsulated. So there was     volts going through these homemade copper wires  homemade plug. And for about five seconds  the toaster toasted  but then  unfortunately  the element kind of melted itself. But I considered it a partial success  to be honest. BG  Thomas Thwaites. TT  Thanks. This room may appear to be holding     people  but there's actually so many more  because in each one of us there is a multitude of personalities. I have two primary personalities that have been in conflict and conversation within me since I was a little girl. I call them  the mystic  and  the warrior.  I was born into a family of politically active  intellectual atheists. There was this equation in my family that went something like this  if you are intelligent  you therefore are not spiritual. I was the freak of the family. I was this weird little kid who wanted to have deep talks about the worlds that might exist beyond the ones that we perceive with our senses. I wanted to know if what we human beings see and hear and think is a full and accurate picture of reality. So  looking for answers  I went to Catholic mass. I tagged along with my neighbors. I read Sartre and Socrates. And then a wonderful thing happened when I was in high school  Gurus from the East started washing up on the shores of America. And I said to myself   I wanna get me one of them.  And ever since  I've been walking the mystic path  trying to peer beyond what Albert Einstein called  the optical delusion of everyday consciousness.  So what did he mean by this  I'll show you. Take a breath right now of this clear air in this room. Now  see this strange  underwater  coral reef looking thing  It's actually a person's trachea  and those colored globs are microbes that are actually swimming around in this room right now  all around us. If we're blind to this simple biology  imagine what we're missing at the smallest subatomic level right now and at the grandest cosmic levels. My years as a mystic have made me question almost all my assumptions. They've made me a proud I don't know it all. Now when the mystic part of me jabbers on and on like this  the warrior rolls her eyes. She's concerned about what's happening in this world right now. She's worried. She says   Excuse me  I'm pissed off  and I know a few things  and we better get busy about them right now.  I've spent my life as a warrior  working for women's issues  working on political campaigns  being an activist for the environment. And it can be sort of crazy making  housing both the mystic and the warrior in one body. I've always been attracted to those rare people who pull that off  who devote their lives to humanity with the grit of the warrior and the grace of the mystic    people like Martin Luther King  Jr.  who wrote   I can never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be. This   he wrote   is the interrelated structure of reality.  Then Mother Teresa  another mystic warrior  who said   The problem with the world is that we draw the circle of our family too small.  And Nelson Mandela  who lives by the African concept of  ubuntu   which means  I need you in order to be me  and you need me in order to be you.  Now we all love to trot out these three mystic warriors as if they were born with the saint gene. But we all actually have the same capacity that they do  and we need to do their work now. I'm deeply disturbed by the ways in which all of our cultures are demonizing  the Other  by the voice we're giving to the most divisive among us. Listen to these titles of some of the bestselling books from both sides of the political divide here in the U.S.  Liberalism Is a Mental Disorder    Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot    Pinheads and Patriots    Arguing With Idiots.  They're supposedly tongue in cheek  but they're actually dangerous. Now here's a title that may sound familiar  but whose author may surprise you   Four and a Half Years of Struggle Against Lies  Stupidity and Cowardice.  Who wrote that  That was Adolf Hitler's first title for  Mein Kampf      My Struggle     the book that launched the Nazi party. The worst eras in human history  whether in Cambodia or Germany or Rwanda  they start like this  with negative other izing. And then they morph into violent extremism. This is why I'm launching a new initiative. And it's to help all of us  myself included  to counteract the tendency to  otherize.  And I realize we're all busy people  so don't worry  you can do this on a lunch break. I'm calling my initiative   Take the Other to Lunch.  If you are a Republican  you can take a Democrat to lunch  or if you're a Democrat  think of it as taking a Republican to lunch. Now if the idea of taking any of these people to lunch makes you lose your appetite  I suggest you start more local  because there is no shortage of the Other right in your own neighborhood. Maybe that person who worships at the mosque  or the church or the synagogue  down the street. Or someone from the other side of the abortion conflict. Or maybe your brother in law who doesn't believe in global warming. Anyone whose lifestyle may frighten you  or whose point of view makes smoke come out of your ears. A couple of weeks ago  I took a Conservative Tea Party woman to lunch. Now on paper  she passed my smoking ears test. She's an activist from the Right  and I'm an activist from the Left. And we used some guidelines to keep our conversation elevated  and you can use them too  because I know you're all going to take an Other to lunch. So first of all  decide on a goal  to get to know one person from a group you may have negatively stereotyped. And then  before you get together  agree on some ground rules. My Tea Party lunchmate and I came up with these  don't persuade  defend or interrupt. Be curious  be conversational  be real. And listen. From there  we dove in. And we used these questions  Share some of your life experiences with me. What issues deeply concern you  And what have you always wanted to ask someone from the other side  My lunch partner and I came away with some really important insights  and I'm going to share just one with you. I think it has relevance to any problem between people anywhere. I asked her why her side makes such outrageous allegations and lies about my side.  What   she wanted to know.  Like we're a bunch of elitist  morally corrupt terrorist lovers.  Well  she was shocked. She thought my side beat up on her side way more often  that we called them brainless  gun toting racists  and we both marveled at the labels that fit none of the people we actually know. And since we had established some trust  we believed in each other's sincerity. We agreed we'd speak up in our own communities when we witnessed the kind of  otherizing  talk that can wound and fester into paranoia and then be used by those on the fringes to incite. By the end of our lunch  we acknowledged each other's openness. Neither of us had tried to change the other. But we also hadn't pretended that our differences were just going to melt away after a lunch. Instead  we had taken first steps together  past our knee jerk reactions  to the ubuntu place  which is the only place where solutions to our most intractable seeming problems will be found. Who should you invite to lunch  Next time you catch yourself in the act of otherizing  that will be your clue. And what might happen at your lunch  Will the heavens open and  We Are the World  play over the restaurant sound system  Probably not. Because ubuntu work is slow  and it's difficult. It's two people dropping the pretense of being know it alls. It's two people  two warriors  dropping their weapons and reaching toward each other. Here's how the great Persian poet Rumi put it   Out beyond ideas of wrong doing and right doing  there is a field. I'll meet you there.  So I'm here to tell you that we have a problem with boys  and it's a serious problem with boys. Their culture isn't working in schools  and I'm going to share with you ways that we can think about overcoming that problem. First  I want to start by saying  this is a boy  and this is a girl  and this is probably stereotypically what you think of as a boy and a girl. If I essentialize gender for you today  then you can dismiss what I have to say. So I'm not going to do that. I'm not interested in doing that. This is a different kind of boy and a different kind of girl. So the point here is that not all boys exist within these rigid boundaries of what we think of as boys and girls  and not all girls exist within those rigid boundaries of what we think of as girls. But  in fact  most boys tend to be a certain way  and most girls tend to be a certain way. And the point is that  for boys  the way that they exist and the culture that they embrace isn't working well in schools now. How do we know that  The Hundred Girls Project tells us some really nice statistics. For example  for every     girls that are suspended from school  there are     boys that are suspended from school. For every     girls who are expelled from school  there are     boys who are expelled from school. For every     girls in special education  there are     boys. For every     girls with a learning disability  there are     boys. For every     girls with an emotional disturbance diagnosed  we have     boys. And by the way  all of these numbers are significantly higher if you happen to be black  if you happen to be poor  if you happen to exist in an overcrowded school. And if you are a boy  you're four times as likely to be diagnosed with ADHD    Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Now there is another side to this. And it is important that we recognize that women still need help in school  that salaries are still significantly lower  even when controlled for job types  and that girls have continued to struggle in math and science for years. That's all true. Nothing about that prevents us from paying attention to the literacy needs of our boys between ages three and   . And so we should. In fact  what we ought to do is take a page from their playbook  because the initiatives and programs that have been set in place for women in science and engineering and mathematics are fantastic. They've done a lot of good for girls in these situations  and we ought to be thinking about how we can make that happen for boys too in their younger years. Even in their older years  what we find is that there's still a problem. When we look at the universities     percent of baccalaureate degrees are going to women now  which is a significant shift. And in fact  university administrators are a little uncomfortable about the idea that we may be getting close to    percent female population in universities. This makes university administrators very nervous  because girls don't want to go to schools that don't have boys. And so we're starting to see the establishment of men centers and men studies to think about how do we engage men in their experiences in the university. If you talk to faculty  they may say   Ugh. Yeah  well  they're playing video games  and they're gambling online all night long  and they're playing World of Warcraft  and that's affecting their academic achievement.  Guess what  Video games are not the cause. Video games are a symptom. They were turned off a long time before they got here. So let's talk about why they got turned off when they were between the ages of three and   . There are three reasons that I believe that boys are out of sync with the culture of schools today. The first is zero tolerance. A kindergarten teacher I know  her son donated all of his toys to her  and when he did  she had to go through and pull out all the little plastic guns. You can't have plastic knives and swords and axes and all that kind of thing in a kindergarten classroom. What is it that we're afraid that this young man is going to do with this gun  I mean  really. But here he stands as testament to the fact that you can't roughhouse on the playground today. Now I'm not advocating for bullies. I'm not suggesting that we need to be allowing guns and knives into school. But when we say that an Eagle Scout in a high school classroom who has a locked parked car in the parking lot and a penknife in it has to be suspended from school  I think we may have gone a little too far with zero tolerance. Another way that zero tolerance lives itself out is in the writing of boys. In a lot of classrooms today you're not allowed to write about anything that's violent. You're not allowed to write about anything that has to do with video games    these topics are banned. Boy comes home from school  and he says   I hate writing.   Why do you hate writing  son  What's wrong with writing    Now I have to write what she tells me to write.   Okay  what is she telling you to write    Poems. I have to write poems. And little moments in my life. I don't want to write that stuff.   All right. Well  what do you want to write  What do you want to write about    I want to write about video games. I want to write about leveling up. I want to write about this really interesting world. I want to write about a tornado that comes into our house and blows all the windows out and ruins all the furniture and kills everybody.   All right. Okay.  You tell a teacher that  and they'll ask you  in all seriousness   Should we send this child to the psychologist   And the answer is no  he's just a boy. He's just a little boy. It's not okay to write these kinds of things in classrooms today. So that's the first reason  zero tolerance policies and the way they're lived out. The next reason that boys' cultures are out of sync with school cultures  there are fewer male teachers. Anybody who's over    doesn't know what this means  because in the last    years  the number of elementary school classroom teachers has been cut in half. We went from    percent to seven percent. That means that    percent of the teachers that our young men get in elementary classrooms are women. Now what's the problem with this  Women are great. Yep  absolutely. But male role models for boys that say it's all right to be smart    they've got dads  they've got pastors  they've got Cub Scout leaders  but ultimately  six hours a day  five days a week they're spending in a classroom  and most of those classrooms are not places where men exist. And so they say  I guess this really isn't a place for boys. This is a place for girls. And I'm not very good at this  so I guess I'd better go play video games or get into sports  or something like that  because I obviously don't belong here. Men don't belong here  that's pretty obvious. So that may be a very direct way that we see it happen. But less directly  the lack of male presence in the culture    you've got a teachers' lounge  and they're having a conversation about Joey and Johnny who beat each other up on the playground.  What are we going to do with these boys   The answer to that question changes depending on who's sitting around that table. Are there men around that table  Are there moms who've raised boys around that table  You'll see  the conversation changes depending upon who's sitting around the table. Third reason that boys are out of sync with school today  kindergarten is the old second grade  folks. We have a serious compression of the curriculum happening out there. When you're three  you better be able to write your name legibly  or else we'll consider it a developmental delay. By the time you're in first grade  you should be able to read paragraphs of text with maybe a picture  maybe not  in a book of maybe    to    pages. If you don't  we're probably going to be putting you into a Title   special reading program. And if you ask Title   teachers  they'll tell you they've got about four or five boys for every girl that's in their program  in the elementary grades. The reason that this is a problem is because the message that boys are getting is  you need to do what the teacher asks you to do all the time.  The teacher's salary depends on  No Child Left Behind  and  Race to the Top  and accountability and testing and all of this. So she has to figure out a way to get all these boys through this curriculum    and girls. This compressed curriculum is bad for all active kids. And what happens is  she says   Please  sit down  be quiet  do what you're told  follow the rules  manage your time  focus  be a girl.  That's what she tells them. Indirectly  that's what she tells them. And so this is a very serious problem. Where is it coming from  It's coming from us. We want our babies to read when they are six months old. Have you seen the ads  We want to live in Lake Wobegon where every child is above average  but what this does to our children is really not healthy. It's not developmentally appropriate  and it's particularly bad for boys. So what do we do  We need to meet them where they are. We need to put ourselves into boy culture. We need to change the mindset of acceptance in boys in elementary schools. More specifically  we can do some very specific things. We can design better games. Most of the educational games that are out there today are really flashcards. They're glorified drill and practice. They don't have the depth  the rich narrative that really engaging video games have  that the boys are really interested in. So we need to design better games. We need to talk to teachers and parents and school board members and politicians. We need to make sure that people see that we need more men in the classroom. We need to look carefully at our zero tolerance policies. Do they make sense  We need to think about how to uncompress this curriculum if we can  trying to bring boys back into a space that is comfortable for them. All of those conversations need to be happening. There are some great examples out there of schools    the New York Times just talked about a school recently. A game designer from the New School put together a wonderful video gaming school. But it only treats a few kids  and so this isn't very scalable. We have to change the culture and the feelings that politicians and school board members and parents have about the way we accept and what we accept in our schools today. We need to find more money for game design. Because good games  really good games  cost money  and World of Warcraft has quite a budget. Most of the educational games do not. Where we started  my colleagues    Mike Petner  Shawn Vashaw  myself    we started by trying to look at the teachers' attitudes and find out how do they really feel about gaming  what do they say about it. And we discovered that they talk about the kids in their school  who talk about gaming  in pretty demeaning ways. They say   Oh  yeah. They're always talking about that stuff. They're talking about their little action figures and their little achievements or merit badges  or whatever it is that they get. And they're always talking about this stuff.  And they say these things as if it's okay. But if it were your culture  think of how that might feel. It's very uncomfortable to be on the receiving end of that kind of language. They're nervous about anything that has anything to do with violence because of the zero tolerance policies. They are sure that parents and administrators will never accept anything. So we really need to think about looking at teacher attitudes and finding ways to change the attitudes so that teachers are much more open and accepting of boy cultures in their classrooms. Because  ultimately  if we don't  then we're going to have boys who leave elementary school saying   Well I guess that was just a place for girls. It wasn't for me. So I've got to do gaming  or I've got to do sports.  If we change these things  if we pay attention to these things  and we re engage boys in their learning  they will leave the elementary schools saying   I'm smart.  Thank you. I just did something I've never done before. I spent a week at sea on a research vessel. Now I'm not a scientist  but I was accompanying a remarkable scientific team from the University of South Florida who have been tracking the travels of BP's oil in the Gulf of Mexico. This is the boat we were on  by the way. The scientists I was with were not studying the effect of the oil and dispersants on the big stuff    the birds  the turtles  the dolphins  the glamorous stuff. They're looking at the really little stuff that gets eaten by the slightly less little stuff that eventually gets eaten by the big stuff. And what they're finding is that even trace amounts of oil and dispersants can be highly toxic to phytoplankton  which is very bad news  because so much life depends on it. So contrary to what we heard a few months back about how    percent of that oil sort of magically disappeared and we didn't have to worry about it  this disaster is still unfolding. It's still working its way up the food chain. Now this shouldn't come as a surprise to us. Rachel Carson    the godmother of modern environmentalism    warned us about this very thing back in     . She pointed out that the  control men     as she called them    who carpet bombed towns and fields with toxic insecticides like DDT  were only trying to kill the little stuff  the insects  not the birds. But they forgot this  the fact that birds dine on grubs  that robins eat lots of worms now saturated with DDT. And so  robin eggs failed to hatch  songbirds died en masse  towns fell silent. Thus the title  Silent Spring.  I've been trying to pinpoint what keeps drawing me back to the Gulf of Mexico  because I'm Canadian  and I can draw no ancestral ties. And I think what it is is I don't think we have fully come to terms with the meaning of this disaster  with what it meant to witness a hole ripped in our world  with what it meant to watch the contents of the Earth gush forth on live TV     hours a day  for months. After telling ourselves for so long that our tools and technology can control nature  suddenly we were face to face with our weakness  with our lack of control  as the oil burst out of every attempt to contain it     top hats    top kills  and  most memorably  the  junk shot     the bright idea of firing old tires and golf balls down that hole in the world. But even more striking than the ferocious power emanating from that well was the recklessness with which that power was unleashed    the carelessness  the lack of planning that characterized the operation from drilling to clean up. If there is one thing BP's watery improv act made clear  it is that  as a culture  we have become far too willing to gamble with things that are precious and irreplaceable  and to do so without a back up plan  without an exit strategy. And BP was hardly our first experience of this in recent years. Our leaders barrel into wars  telling themselves happy stories about cakewalks and welcome parades. Then  it is years of deadly damage control  Frankensteins of sieges and surges and counter insurgencies  and once again  no exit strategy. Our financial wizards routinely fall victim to similar overconfidence  convincing themselves that the latest bubble is a new kind of market    the kind that never goes down. And when it inevitably does  the best and the brightest reach for the financial equivalent of the junk shot    in this case  throwing massive amounts of much needed public money down a very different kind of hole. As with BP  the hole does get plugged  at least temporarily  but not before exacting a tremendous price. We have to figure out why we keep letting this happen  because we are in the midst of what may be our highest stakes gamble of all    deciding what to do  or not to do  about climate change. Now as you know  a great deal of time is spent  in this country and around the world  inside the climate debate  on the question of   What if the IPC scientists are all wrong   Now a far more relevant question    as MIT physicist Evelyn Fox Keller puts it    is   What if those scientists are right   Given the stakes  the climate crisis clearly calls for us to act based on the precautionary principle    the theory that holds that when human health and the environment are significantly at risk and when the potential damage is irreversible  we cannot afford to wait for perfect scientific certainty. Better to err on the side of caution. More overt  the burden of proving that a practice is safe should not be placed on the public that would be harmed  but rather on the industry that stands to profit. But climate policy in the wealthy world    to the extent that such a thing exists    is not based on precaution  but rather on cost benefit analysis    finding the course of action that economists believe will have the least impact on our GDP. So rather than asking  as precaution would demand  what can we do as quickly as possible to avoid potential catastrophe  we ask bizarre questions like this   What is the latest possible moment we can wait before we begin seriously lowering emissions  Can we put this off till                    Or we ask   How much hotter can we let the planet get and still survive  Can we go with two degrees  three degrees  or    where we're currently going    four degrees Celsius   And by the way  the assumption that we can safely control the Earth's awesomely complex climate system as if it had a thermostat  making the planet not too hot  not too cold  but just right    sort of Goldilocks style    this is pure fantasy  and it's not coming from the climate scientists. It's coming from the economists imposing their mechanistic thinking on the science. The fact is that we simply don't know when the warming that we create will be utterly overwhelmed by feedback loops. So once again  why do we take these crazy risks with the precious  A range of explanations may be popping into your mind by now  like  greed.  This is a popular explanation  and there's lots of truth to it  because taking big risks  as we all know  pays a lot of money. Another explanation that you often hear for recklessness is hubris. And greed and hubris are intimately intertwined when it comes to recklessness. For instance  if you happen to be a    year old banker taking home     times more than a brain surgeon  then you need a narrative  you need a story that makes that disparity okay. And you actually don't have a lot of options. You're either an incredibly good scammer  and you're getting away with it    you gamed the system    or you're some kind of boy genius  the likes of which the world has never seen. Now both of these options    the boy genius and the scammer    are going to make you vastly overconfident and therefore more prone to taking even bigger risks in the future. By the way  Tony Hayward  the former CEO of BP  had a plaque on his desk inscribed with this inspirational slogan   What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail   Now this is actually a popular plaque  and this is a crowd of overachievers  so I'm betting that some of you have this plaque. Don't feel ashamed. Putting fear of failure out of your mind can be a very good thing if you're training for a triathlon or preparing to give a TEDTalk  but personally  I think people with the power to detonate our economy and ravage our ecology would do better having a picture of Icarus hanging from the wall  because    maybe not that one in particular    but I want them thinking about the possibility of failure all of the time. So we have greed  we've got overconfidence hubris  but since we're here at TEDWomen  let's consider one other factor that could be contributing in some small way to societal recklessness. Now I'm not going to belabor this point  but studies do show that  as investors  women are much less prone to taking reckless risks than men  precisely because  as we've already heard  women tend not to suffer from overconfidence in the same way that men do. So it turns out that being paid less and praised less has its upsides    for society at least. The flipside of this is that constantly being told that you are gifted  chosen and born to rule has distinct societal downsides. And this problem    call it the  perils of privilege     brings us closer  I think  to the root of our collective recklessness. Because none of us    at least in the global North    neither men nor women  are fully exempt from this message. Here's what I'm talking about. Whether we actively believe them or consciously reject them  our culture remains in the grips of certain archetypal stories about our supremacy over others and over nature    the narrative of the newly discovered frontier and the conquering pioneer  the narrative of manifest destiny  the narrative of apocalypse and salvation. And just when you think these stories are fading into history  and that we've gotten over them  they pop up in the strangest places. For instance  I stumbled across this advertisement outside the women's washroom in the Kansas City airport. It's for Motorola's new Rugged cell phone  and yes  it really does say   Slap Mother Nature in the face.  And I'm not just showing it to pick on Motorola    that's just a bonus. I'm showing it because    they're not a sponsor  are they     because  in its own way  this is a crass version of our founding story. We slapped Mother Nature around and won  and we always win  because dominating nature is our destiny. But this is not the only fairytale we tell ourselves about nature. There's another one  equally important  about how that very same Mother Nature is so nurturing and so resilient that we can never make a dent in her abundance. Let's hear from Tony Hayward again.  The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean. The amount of oil and dispersants that we are putting into it is tiny in relation to the total water volume.  In other words  the ocean is big  she can take it. It is this underlying assumption of limitlessness that makes it possible to take the reckless risks that we do. Because this is our real master narrative  however much we mess up  there will always be more    more water  more land  more untapped resources. A new bubble will replace the old one. A new technology will come along to fix the messes we made with the last one. In a way  that is the story of the settling of the Americas  the supposedly inexhaustible frontier to which Europeans escaped. And it's also the story of modern capitalism  because it was the wealth from this land that gave birth to our economic system  one that cannot survive without perpetual growth and an unending supply of new frontiers. Now the problem is that the story was always a lie. The Earth always did have limits. They were just beyond our sights. And now we are hitting those limits on multiple fronts. I believe that we know this  yet we find ourselves trapped in a kind of narrative loop. Not only do we continue to tell and retell the same tired stories  but we are now doing so with a frenzy and a fury that  frankly  verges on camp. How else to explain the cultural space occupied by Sarah Palin  Now on the one hand  exhorting us to  drill  baby  drill   because God put those resources into the ground in order for us to exploit them  and on the other  glorying in the wilderness of Alaska's untouched beauty on her hit reality TV show. The twin message is as comforting as it is mad. Ignore those creeping fears that we have finally hit the wall. There are still no limits. There will always be another frontier. So stop worrying and keep shopping. Now  would that this were just about Sarah Palin and her reality TV show. In environmental circles  we often hear that  rather than shifting to renewables  we are continuing with business as usual. This assessment  unfortunately  is far too optimistic. The truth is that we have already exhausted so much of the easily accessible fossil fuels that we have already entered a far riskier business era  the era of extreme energy. So that means drilling for oil in the deepest water  including the icy Arctic seas  where a clean up may simply be impossible. It means large scale hydraulic fracking for gas and massive strip mining operations for coal  the likes of which we haven't yet seen. And most controversially  it means the tar sands. I'm always surprised by how little people outside of Canada know about the Alberta Tar Sands  which this year are projected to become the number one source of imported oil to the United States. It's worth taking a moment to understand this practice  because I believe it speaks to recklessness and the path we're on like little else. So this is where the tar sands live  under one of the last magnificent Boreal forests. The oil is not liquid. You can't just drill a hole and pump it out. Tar sand's oil is solid  mixed in with the soil. So to get at it  you first have to get rid of the trees. Then  you rip off the topsoil and get at that oily sand. The process requires a huge amount of water  which is then pumped into massive toxic tailing ponds. That's very bad news for local indigenous people living downstream who are reporting alarmingly high cancer rates. Now looking at these images  it's difficult to grasp the scale of this operation  which can already be seen from space and could grow to an area the size of England. I find it helps actually to look at the dump trucks that move the earth  the largest ever built. That's a person down there by the wheel. My point is that this is not oil drilling. It's not even mining. It is terrestrial skinning. Vast  vivid landscapes are being gutted  left monochromatic gray. Now I should confess that as  far as  I'm concerned this would be an abomination if it emitted not one particle of carbon. But the truth is that  on average  turning that gunk into crude oil produces about three times more greenhouse gas pollution than it does to produce conventional oil in Canada. How else to describe this  but as a form of mass insanity  Just when we know we need to be learning to live on the surface of our planet  off the power of sun  wind and waves  we are frantically digging to get at the dirtiest  highest emitting stuff imaginable. This is where our story of endless growth has taken us  to this black hole at the center of my country    a place of such planetary pain that  like the BP gusher  one can only stand to look at it for so long. As Jared Diamond and others have shown us  this is how civilizations commit suicide  by slamming their foot on the accelerator at the exact moment when they should be putting on the brakes. The problem is that our master narrative has an answer for that too. At the very last minute  we are going to get saved just like in every Hollywood movie  just like in the Rapture. But  of course  our secular religion is technology. Now  you may have noticed more and more headlines like these. The idea behind this form of  geoengineering  as it's called  is that  as the planet heats up  we may be able to shoot sulfates and aluminum particles into the stratosphere to reflect some of the sun's rays back to space  thereby cooling the planet. The wackiest plan    and I'm not making this up    would put what is essentially a garden hose    and a half miles high into the sky  suspended by balloons  to spew sulfur dioxide. So  solving the problem of pollution with more pollution. Think of it as the ultimate junk shot. The serious scientists involved in this research all stress that these techniques are entirely untested. They don't know if they'll work  and they have no idea what kind of terrifying side effects they could unleash. Nevertheless  the mere mention of geoengineering is being greeted in some circles  particularly media circles  with a relief tinged with euphoria. An escape hatch has been reached. A new frontier has been found. Most importantly  we don't have to change our lifestyles after all. You see  for some people  their savior is a guy in a flowing robe. For other people  it's a guy with a garden hose. We badly need some new stories. We need stories that have different kinds of heroes willing to take different kinds of risks    risks that confront recklessness head on  that put the precautionary principle into practice  even if that means through direct action    like hundreds of young people willing to get arrested  blocking dirty power plants or fighting mountaintop removal coal mining. We need stories that replace that linear narrative of endless growth with circular narratives that remind us that what goes around comes around. That this is our only home. There is no escape hatch. Call it karma  call it physics  action and reaction  call it precaution    the principle that reminds us that life is too precious to be risked for any profit. Thank you. You may not know this  but you are celebrating an anniversary with me. I'm not married  but one year ago today  I woke up from a month long coma  following a double lung transplant. Crazy  I know. Insane. Thank you. Six years before that  I was starting my career as an opera singer in Europe  when I was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension    also known as PH. It happens when there's a thickening in the pulmonary veins  making the right side of the heart work overtime  and causing what I call the reverse Grinch effect. My heart was three and a half sizes too big. Physical activity becomes very difficult for people with this condition  and usually after two to five years  you die. I went to see this specialist  and she was top of the field and told me I had to stop singing. She said   Those high notes are going to kill you.  While she didn't have any medical evidence to back up her claim that there was a relationship between operatic arias and pulmonary hypertension  she was absolutely emphatic I was singing my own obituary. I was very limited by my condition  physically. But I was not limited when I sang  and as air came up from my lungs  through my vocal cords and passed my lips as sound  it was the closest thing I had ever come to transcendence. And just because of someone's hunch  I wasn't going to give it up. Thankfully  I met Reda Girgis  who is dry as toast  but he and his team at Johns Hopkins didn't just want me to survive  they wanted me to live a meaningful life. This meant making trade offs. I come from Colorado. It's a mile high  and I grew up there with my    brothers and sisters and two adoring parents. Well  the altitude exacerbated my symptoms. So I moved to Baltimore to be near my doctors and enrolled in a conservatory nearby. I couldn't walk as much as I used to  so I opted for five inch heels. And I gave up salt  I went vegan  and I started taking huge doses of sildenafil  also known as Viagra. My father and my grandfather were always looking for the newest thing in alternative or traditional therapies for PH  but after six months  I couldn't walk up a small hill. I couldn't climb a flight of stairs. I could barely stand up without feeling like I was going to faint. I had a heart catheterization  where they measure this internal arterial pulmonary pressure  which is supposed to be between    and   . Mine was    . I like to do things big  and it meant one thing  there is a big gun treatment for pulmonary hypertension called Flolan  and it's not just a drug  it's a way of life. Doctors insert a catheter into your chest  which is attached to a pump that weighs about four and a half pounds. Every day     hours  that pump is at your side  administering medicine directly to your heart  and it's not a particularly preferable medicine in many senses. This is a list of the side effects  if you eat too much salt  like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich  you'll probably end up in the ICU. If you go through a metal detector  you'll probably die. If you get a bubble in your medicine    because you have to mix it every morning    and it stays in there  you probably die. If you run out of medicine  you definitely die. No one wants to go on Flolan. But when I needed it  it was a godsend. Within a few days  I could walk again. Within a few weeks  I was performing  and in a few months  I debuted at the Kennedy Center. The pump was a little bit problematic when performing  so I'd attach it to my inner thigh with the help of the girdle and an ACE bandage. Literally hundreds of elevator rides were spent with me alone stuffing the pump into my Spanx  hoping the doors wouldn't open unexpectedly. And the tubing coming out of my chest was a nightmare for costume designers. I graduated from graduate school in       and I got a fellowship to go back to Europe. A few days after arriving  I met this wonderful  old conductor who started casting me in all of these roles. And before long  I was commuting between Budapest  Milan and Florence. Though I was attached to this ugly  unwanted  high maintenance  mechanical pet  my life was kind of like the happy part in an opera    very complicated  but in a good way. Then in February of       my grandfather passed away. He was a big figure in all of our lives  and we loved him very much. It certainly didn't prepare me for what came next. Seven weeks later  I got a call from my family. My father had been in a catastrophic car accident  and he died. At     my death would have been entirely expected. But his    well  the only way I can articulate how it felt was that it precipitated my medical decline. Against my doctors' and family's wishes  I needed to go back for the funeral. I had to say goodbye in some way  shape or form. But soon I was showing signs of right heart failure  and I had to return to sea level  doing so knowing that I probably would never see my home again. I canceled most of my engagements that summer  but I had one left in Tel Aviv  so I went. After one performance  I could barely drag myself from the stage to the taxicab. I sat down and felt the blood rush down from my face  and in the heat of the desert  I was freezing cold. My fingers started turning blue  and I was like   What is going on here   I heard my heart's valves snapping open and closed. The cab stopped  and I pulled my body from it feeling each ounce of weight as I walked to the elevator. I fell through my apartment door and crawled to the bathroom where I found my problem  I had forgotten to mix in the most important part of my medicine. I was dying  and if I didn't mix that stuff up fast  I would never leave that apartment alive. I started mixing  and I felt like everything was going to fall out through one hole or another  but I just kept on going. Finally  with the last bottle in and the last bubble out  I attached the pump to the tubing and lay there hoping it would kick in soon enough. If it didn't  I'd probably see my father sooner than I anticipated. Thankfully  in a few minutes  I saw the signature hive like rash appear on my legs  which is a side effect of the medication  and I knew I'd be okay. We're not big on fear in my family  but I was scared. I went back to the States  anticipating I'd return to Europe  but the heart catheterization showed that I wasn't going anywhere further that a flight for life from Johns Hopkins Hospital. I performed here and there  but as my condition deteriorated  so did my voice. My doctor wanted me to get on the list for a lung transplant. I didn't. I had two friends who had recently died months after having very challenging surgeries. I knew another young man  though  who had PH who died while waiting for one. I wanted to live. I thought stem cells were a good option  but they hadn't developed to a point where I could take advantage of them yet. I officially took a break from singing  and I went to the Cleveland Clinic to be reevaluated for the third time in five years  for transplant. I was sitting there kind of unenthusiastically talking with the head transplant surgeon  and I asked him if I needed a transplant  what I could do to prepare. He said   Be happy. A happy patient is a healthy patient.  It was like in one verbal swoop he had channeled my thoughts on life and medicine and Confucius. I still didn't want a transplant  but in a month  I was back in the hospital with some severely edemic kankles    very attractive. And it was right heart failure. I finally decided it was time to take my doctor's advice. It was time for me to go to Cleveland and to start the agonizing wait for a match. But the next morning  while I was still in the hospital  I got a telephone call. It was my doctor in Cleveland  Marie Budev. And they had lungs. It was a match. They were from Texas. And everybody was really happy for me  but me. Because  despite their problems  I had spent my whole life training my lungs  and I was not particularly enthusiastic about giving them up. I flew to Cleveland  and my family rushed there in hopes that they would meet me and say what we knew might be our final goodbye. But organs don't wait  and I went into surgery before I could say goodbye. The last thing I remember was lying on a white blanket  telling my surgeon that I needed to see my mother again  and to please try and save my voice. I fell into this apocalyptic dream world. During the thirteen and a half hour surgery  I flatlined twice     quarts of blood were infused into my body. And in my surgeon's    year career  he said it was among the most difficult transplants that he's ever performed. They left my chest open for two weeks. You could see my over sized heart beating inside of it. I was on a dozen machines that were keeping me alive. An infection ravaged my skin. I had hoped my voice would be saved  but my doctors knew that the breathing tubes going down my throat might have already destroyed it. If they stayed in  there was no way I would ever sing again. So my doctor got the ENT  the top guy at the clinic  to come down and give me surgery to move the tubes around my voice box. He said it would kill me. So my own surgeon performed the procedure in a last ditch attempt to save my voice. Though my mom couldn't say goodbye to me before the surgery  she didn't leave my side in the months of recovery that followed. And if you want an example of perseverance  grit and strength in a beautiful  little package  it is her. One year ago to this very day  I woke up. I was    lbs. There were a dozen tubes coming in and out of my body. I couldn't walk  I couldn't talk  I couldn't eat  I couldn't move  I certainly couldn't sing  I couldn't even breathe  but when I looked up and I saw my mother  I couldn't help but smile. Whether by a Mack truck or by heart failure or faulty lungs  death happens. But life isn't really just about avoiding death  is it  It's about living. Medical conditions don't negate the human condition. And when people are allowed to pursue their passions  doctors will find they have better  happier and healthier patients. My parents were totally stressed out about me going and auditioning and traveling and performing all over the place  but they knew that it was much better for me to do that than be preoccupied with my own mortality all of the time. And I'm so grateful they did. This past summer  when I was running and singing and dancing and playing with my nieces and my nephews and my brothers and my sisters and my mother and my grandmother in the Colorado Rockies  I couldn't help but think of that doctor who told me that I couldn't sing. And I wanted to tell her  and I want to tell you  we need to stop letting disease divorce us from our dreams. When we do  we will find that patients don't just survive  we thrive. And some of us might even sing.  Singing  French  Thank you. Thank you. And I'd like to thank my pianist  Monica Lee. Thank you so much. Thank you. I am honored to be here  and I'm honored to talk about this topic  which I think is of grave importance. We've been talking a lot about the horrific impacts of plastic on the planet and on other species  but plastic hurts people too  especially poor people. And both in the production of plastic  the use of plastic and the disposal of plastic  the people who have the bull's eye on their foreheads are poor people. People got very upset when the BP oil spill happened for very good reason. People thought about   Oh  my God. This is terrible  this oil    it's in the water. It's going to destroy the living systems there. People are going to be hurt. This is a terrible thing  that the oil is going to hurt the people in the Gulf.  What people don't think about is  what if the oil had made it safely to shore  What if the oil actually got where it was trying to go  Not only would it have been burned in engines and added to global warming  but there's a place called  Cancer Alley   and the reason it's called  Cancer Alley  is because the petrochemical industry takes that oil and turns it into plastic and  in the process  kills people. It shortens the lives of the people who live there in the Gulf. So oil and petrochemicals are not just a problem where there's a spill  they're a problem where there's not. And what we don't often appreciate is the price that poor people pay for us to have these disposable products. The other thing that we don't often appreciate is it's not just at the point of production that poor people suffer. Poor people also suffer at the point of use. Those of us who earn a certain income level  we have something called choice. The reason why you want to work hard and have a job and not be poor and broke is so you can have choices  economic choices. We actually get a chance to choose not to use products that have dangerous  poisonous plastic in them. Other people who are poor don't have those choices. So low income people often are the ones who are buying the products that have those dangerous chemicals in them that their children are using. Those are the people who wind up actually ingesting a disproportionate amount of this poisonous plastic and using it. And people say   Well  they should just buy a different product.  Well  the problem with being poor is you don't have those choices. You often have to buy the cheapest products. The cheapest products are often the most dangerous. And if that weren't bad enough  if it wasn't just the production of plastic that's giving people cancer in places like  Cancer Alley  and shortening lives and hurting poor kids at the point of use  at the point of disposal  once again  it's poor people who bear the burden. Often  we think we're doing a good thing. You're in your office  and you're drinking your bottled water  or whatever it is  and you think to yourself   Hey  I'm going to throw this away. No  I'm going to be virtuous. I'm going to put it in the blue bin.  You think   I put mine in the blue bin   and then you look at your colleague and say   Why  you cretin. You put yours in the white bin.  And we use that as a moral tickle. We feel so good about ourselves. Maybe I'll feel good myself. Not you  but I feel this way. And so we kind of have this kind of moral feel good moment. But if we were to be able to follow that little bottle on its journey  we would be shocked to discover that  all too often  that bottle is going to be put on a boat  it's going to go all the way across the ocean at some expense  and it's going to wind up in a developing country    often China. I think in our minds we imagine somebody's going to take the little bottle  say   Oh  little bottle. We're so happy to see you  little bottle.   You've served so well.  He's given a little bottle massage  a little bottle medal. And say   What would you like to do next   The little bottle says   I just don't know.  But that's not actually what happens. That bottle winds up getting burned. Recycling of plastic in many developing countries means the incineration of the plastic  the burning of the plastic  which releases incredible toxic chemicals and  once again  kills people. And so poor people who are making these products in petrochemical centers like  Cancer Alley   poor people who are consuming these products disproportionately  and then poor people  who even at the tail end of the recycling are having their lives shortened  are all being harmed greatly by this addiction that we have to disposability. Now you think to yourself    because I know how you are    you say   That sure is terrible for those poor people. It's just awful  those poor people. I hope someone does something to help them.  But what we don't understand is    is  here we are in Los Angeles. We worked very hard to get the smog reduction happening here in Los Angeles. But guess what  Because they're doing so much dirty production in Asia now  because the environmental laws don't protect the people in Asia now  almost all of the clean air gains and the toxic air gains that we've achieved here in California have been wiped out by dirty air coming over from Asia. So  we all are being hit. We all are being impacted. It's just the poor people get hit first and worst. But the dirty production  the burning of toxins  the lack of environmental standards in Asia is actually creating so much dirty air pollution it's coming across the ocean and has erased our gains here in California. We're back where we were in the     s. And so we're on one planet  and we have to be able to get to the root of these problems. Well the root of this problem  in my view  is the idea of disposability itself. You see  if you understand the link between what we're doing to poison and pollute the planet and what we're doing to poor people  you arrive at a very troubling  but also very helpful  insight  In order to trash the planet  you have to trash people. But if you create a world where you don't trash people  you can't trash the planet. So now we are at a moment where the coming together of social justice as an idea and ecology as an idea  we finally can now see that they are really  at the end of the day  one idea. And it's the idea that we don't have disposable anything. We don't have disposable resources. We don't have disposable species. And we don't have disposable people either. We don't have a throwaway planet  and we don't have throwaway children    it's all precious. And as we all begin to come back to that basic understanding  new opportunities for action begin to emerge. Biomimicry  which is something that is an emerging science  winds up being a very important social justice idea. People who are just learning about this stuff  biomimicry means respecting the wisdom of all species. Democracy  by the way  means respecting the wisdom of all people    and we'll get to that. But biomimicry means respecting the wisdom of all species. It turns out we're a pretty clever species. This big cortex  or whatever  we're pretty proud of ourselves. But if we want to make something hard  we come up   I know  I'm going to make a hard substance. I know  I'm going to get vacuums and furnaces and drag stuff out of the ground and get things hot and poison and pollute  but I got this hard thing. I'm so clever   and you look behind you  and there's destruction all around you. But guess what  You're so clever  but you're not as clever as a clam. A clamshell's hard. There's no vacuums. There's no big furnaces. There's no poison. There's no pollution. It turns out that our other species has figured out a long time ago how to create many of the things that we need using biological processes that nature knows how to use well. Well that insight of biomimicry  of our scientists finally realizing that we have as much to learn from other species. I don't mean taking a mouse and sticking it with stuff. I don't mean looking at it from that way    abusing the little species. I mean actually respecting them  respecting what they've achieved. That's called biomimicry  and that opens the door to zero waste production  zero pollution production    that we could actually enjoy a high quality of life  a high standard of living without trashing the planet. Well that idea of biomimicry  respecting the wisdom of all species  combined with the idea of democracy and social justice  respecting the wisdom and the worth of all people  would give us a different society. We would have a different economy. We would have a green society that Dr. King would be proud of. That should be the goal. And the way that we get there is to first of all recognize that the idea of disposability not only hurts the species we've talked about  but it even corrupts our own society. We're so proud to live here in California. We just had this vote  and everybody's like   Well  not in our state. I don't know what those other states were doing.  Just so proud. And  yeah  I'm proud  too. But California  though we lead the world in some of the green stuff  we also  unfortunately  lead the world in some of the gulag stuff. California has one of the highest incarceration rates of all the    states. We have a moral challenge in this moment. We are passionate about rescuing some dead materials from the landfill  but sometimes not as passionate about rescuing living beings  living people. And I would say that we live in a country    five percent of the world's population     percent of the greenhouse gases  but also    percent of the world's prisoners. One out of every four people locked up anywhere in the world is locked up right here in the United States. So that is consistent with this idea that disposability is something we believe in. And yet  as a movement that has to broaden its constituency  that has to grow  that has to reach out beyond our natural comfort zone  one of the challenges to the success of this movement  of getting rid of things like plastic and helping the economy shift  is people look at our movement with some suspicion. And they ask a question  and the question is  How can these people be so passionate  A poor person  a low income person  somebody in  Cancer Alley   somebody in Watts  somebody in Harlem  somebody on an Indian reservation  might say to themselves  and rightfully so   How can these people be so passionate about making sure that a plastic bottle has a second chance in life  or an aluminum can has a second chance  and yet  when my child gets in trouble and goes to prison  he doesn't get a second chance   How can this movement be so passionate about saying we don't have throwaway stuff  no throwaway dead materials  and yet accept throwaway lives and throwaway communities like  Cancer Alley   And so we now get a chance to be truly proud of this movement. When we take on topics like this  it gives us that extra call to reach out to other movements and to become more inclusive and to grow  and we can finally get out of this crazy dilemma that we've been in. Most of you are good  softhearted people. When you were younger  you cared about the whole world  and at some point somebody said you had to pick an issue  you had to boil your love down to an issue. Can't love the whole world    you've got to work on trees  or you've got to work on immigration. You've got to shrink it down and be about one issue. And really  they fundamentally told you   Are you going to hug a tree  or are you going to hug a child  Pick. Are you going to hug a tree  or are you going to hug a child  Pick.  Well  when you start working on issues like plastic  you realize that the whole thing is connected  and luckily most of us are blessed to have two arms. We can hug both. Thank you very much. I will start by posing a little bit of a challenge  the challenge of dealing with data  data that we have to deal with in medical situations. It's really a huge challenge for us. And this is our beast of burden    this is a Computer Tomography machine  a CT machine. It's a fantastic device. It uses X rays  X ray beams  that are rotating very fast around the human body. It takes about    seconds to go through the whole machine and is generating enormous amounts of information that comes out of the machine. So this is a fantastic machine that we can use for improving health care  but as I said  it's also a challenge for us. And the challenge is really found in this picture here. It's the medical data explosion that we're having right now. We're facing this problem. And let me step back in time. Let's go back a few years in time and see what happened back then. These machines that came out    they started coming in the     s    they would scan human bodies  and they would generate about     images of the human body. And I've taken the liberty  just for clarity  to translate that to data slices. That would correspond to about    megabytes of data  which is small when you think about the data we can handle today just on normal mobile devices. If you translate that to phone books  it's about one meter of phone books in the pile. Looking at what we're doing today with these machines that we have  we can  just in a few seconds  get        images out of a body  and that would correspond to about    gigabytes of data  or     phone books  and the pile would then be     meters of phone books. What's about to happen    and we're seeing this  it's beginning    a technology trend that's happening right now is that we're starting to look at time resolved situations as well. So we're getting the dynamics out of the body as well. And just assume that we will be collecting data during five seconds  and that would correspond to one terabyte of data    that's         books and    kilometers of phone books. That's one patient  one data set. And this is what we have to deal with. So this is really the enormous challenge that we have. And already today    this is        images. Imagine the days when we had radiologists doing this. They would put up        images  they would go like this            okay  okay. There is the problem.  They can't do that anymore. That's impossible. So we have to do something that's a little bit more intelligent than doing this. So what we do is that we put all these slices together. Imagine that you slice your body in all these directions  and then you try to put the slices back together again into a pile of data  into a block of data. So this is really what we're doing. So this gigabyte or terabyte of data  we're putting it into this block. But of course  the block of data just contains the amount of X ray that's been absorbed in each point in the human body. So what we need to do is to figure out a way of looking at the things we do want to look at and make things transparent that we don't want to look at. So transforming the data set into something that looks like this. And this is a challenge. This is a huge challenge for us to do that. Using computers  even though they're getting faster and better all the time  it's a challenge to deal with gigabytes of data  terabytes of data and extracting the relevant information. I want to look at the heart. I want to look at the blood vessels. I want to look at the liver. Maybe even find a tumor  in some cases. So this is where this little dear comes into play. This is my daughter. This is as of   a.m. this morning. She's playing a computer game. She's only two years old  and she's having a blast. So she's really the driving force behind the development of graphics processing units. As long as kids are playing computer games  graphics is getting better and better and better. So please go back home  tell your kids to play more games  because that's what I need. So what's inside of this machine is what enables me to do the things that I'm doing with the medical data. So really what I'm doing is using these fantastic little devices. And you know  going back maybe    years in time when I got the funding to buy my first graphics computer    it was a huge machine. It was cabinets of processors and storage and everything. I paid about one million dollars for that machine. That machine is  today  about as fast as my iPhone. So every month there are new graphics cards coming out  and here is a few of the latest ones from the vendors    NVIDIA  ATI  Intel is out there as well. And you know  for a few hundred bucks you can get these things and put them into your computer  and you can do fantastic things with these graphics cards. So this is really what's enabling us to deal with the explosion of data in medicine  together with some really nifty work in terms of algorithms    compressing data  extracting the relevant information that people are doing research on. So I'm going to show you a few examples of what we can do. This is a data set that was captured using a CT scanner. You can see that this is a full data  set . It's a woman. You can see the hair. You can see the individual structures of the woman. You can see that there is  a  scattering of X rays on the teeth  the metal in the teeth. That's where those artifacts are coming from. But fully interactively on standard graphics cards on a normal computer  I can just put in a clip plane. And of course all the data is inside  so I can start rotating  I can look at it from different angles  and I can see that this woman had a problem. She had a bleeding up in the brain  and that's been fixed with a little stent  a metal clamp that's tightening up the vessel. And just by changing the functions  then I can decide what's going to be transparent and what's going to be visible. I can look at the skull structure  and I can see that  okay  this is where they opened up the skull on this woman  and that's where they went in. So these are fantastic images. They're really high resolution  and they're really showing us what we can do with standard graphics cards today. Now we have really made use of this  and we have tried to squeeze a lot of data into the system. And one of the applications that we've been working on    and this has gotten a little bit of traction worldwide    is the application of virtual autopsies. So again  looking at very  very large data sets  and you saw those full body scans that we can do. We're just pushing the body through the whole CT scanner  and just in a few seconds we can get a full body data set. So this is from a virtual autopsy. And you can see how I'm gradually peeling off. First you saw the body bag that the body came in  then I'm peeling off the skin    you can see the muscles    and eventually you can see the bone structure of this woman. Now at this point  I would also like to emphasize that  with the greatest respect for the people that I'm now going to show    I'm going to show you a few cases of virtual autopsies    so it's with great respect for the people that have died under violent circumstances that I'm showing these pictures to you. In the forensic case    and this is something that ... there's been approximately     cases so far just in the part of Sweden that I come from that has been undergoing virtual autopsies in the past four years. So this will be the typical workflow situation. The police will decide    in the evening  when there's a case coming in    they will decide  okay  is this a case where we need to do an autopsy  So in the morning  in between six and seven in the morning  the body is then transported inside of the body bag to our center and is being scanned through one of the CT scanners. And then the radiologist  together with the pathologist and sometimes the forensic scientist  looks at the data that's coming out  and they have a joint session. And then they decide what to do in the real physical autopsy after that. Now looking at a few cases  here's one of the first cases that we had. You can really see the details of the data set. It's very high resolution  and it's our algorithms that allow us to zoom in on all the details. And again  it's fully interactive  so you can rotate and you can look at things in real time on these systems here. Without saying too much about this case  this is a traffic accident  a drunk driver hit a woman. And it's very  very easy to see the damages on the bone structure. And the cause of death is the broken neck. And this women also ended up under the car  so she's quite badly beaten up by this injury. Here's another case  a knifing. And this is also again showing us what we can do. It's very easy to look at metal artifacts that we can show inside of the body. You can also see some of the artifacts from the teeth    that's actually the filling of the teeth    but because I've set the functions to show me metal and make everything else transparent. Here's another violent case. This really didn't kill the person. The person was killed by stabs in the heart  but they just deposited the knife by putting it through one of the eyeballs. Here's another case. It's very interesting for us to be able to look at things like knife stabbings. Here you can see that knife went through the heart. It's very easy to see how air has been leaking from one part to another part  which is difficult to do in a normal  standard  physical autopsy. So it really  really helps the criminal investigation to establish the cause of death  and in some cases also directing the investigation in the right direction to find out who the killer really was. Here's another case that I think is interesting. Here you can see a bullet that has lodged just next to the spine on this person. And what we've done is that we've turned the bullet into a light source  so that bullet is actually shining  and it makes it really easy to find these fragments. During a physical autopsy  if you actually have to dig through the body to find these fragments  that's actually quite hard to do. One of the things that I'm really  really happy to be able to show you here today is our virtual autopsy table. It's a touch device that we have developed based on these algorithms  using standard graphics GPUs. It actually looks like this  just to give you a feeling for what it looks like. It really just works like a huge iPhone. So we've implemented all the gestures you can do on the table  and you can think of it as an enormous touch interface. So if you were thinking of buying an iPad  forget about it. This is what you want instead. Steve  I hope you're listening to this  all right. So it's a very nice little device. So if you have the opportunity  please try it out. It's really a hands on experience. So it gained some traction  and we're trying to roll this out and trying to use it for educational purposes  but also  perhaps in the future  in a more clinical situation. There's a YouTube video that you can download and look at this  if you want to convey the information to other people about virtual autopsies. Okay  now that we're talking about touch  let me move on to really  touching  data. And this is a bit of science fiction now  so we're moving into really the future. This is not really what the medical doctors are using right now  but I hope they will in the future. So what you're seeing on the left is a touch device. It's a little mechanical pen that has very  very fast step motors inside of the pen. And so I can generate a force feedback. So when I virtually touch data  it will generate forces in the pen  so I get a feedback. So in this particular situation  it's a scan of a living person. I have this pen  and I look at the data  and I move the pen towards the head  and all of a sudden I feel resistance. So I can feel the skin. If I push a little bit harder  I'll go through the skin  and I can feel the bone structure inside. If I push even harder  I'll go through the bone structure  especially close to the ear where the bone is very soft. And then I can feel the brain inside  and this will be the slushy like this. So this is really nice. And to take that even further  this is a heart. And this is also due to these fantastic new scanners  that just in  .  seconds  I can scan the whole heart  and I can do that with time resolution. So just looking at this heart  I can play back a video here. And this is Karljohan  one of my graduate students who's been working on this project. And he's sitting there in front of the Haptic device  the force feedback system  and he's moving his pen towards the heart  and the heart is now beating in front of him  so he can see how the heart is beating. He's taken the pen  and he's moving it towards the heart  and he's putting it on the heart  and then he feels the heartbeats from the real living patient. Then he can examine how the heart is moving. He can go inside  push inside of the heart  and really feel how the valves are moving. And this  I think  is really the future for heart surgeons. I mean it's probably the wet dream for a heart surgeon to be able to go inside of the patient's heart before you actually do surgery  and do that with high quality resolution data. So this is really neat. Now we're going even further into science fiction. And we heard a little bit about functional MRI. Now this is really an interesting project. MRI is using magnetic fields and radio frequencies to scan the brain  or any part of the body. So what we're really getting out of this is information of the structure of the brain  but we can also measure the difference in magnetic properties of blood that's oxygenated and blood that's depleted of oxygen. That means that it's possible to map out the activity of the brain. So this is something that we've been working on. And you just saw Motts the research engineer  there  going into the MRI system  and he was wearing goggles. So he could actually see things in the goggles. So I could present things to him while he's in the scanner. And this is a little bit freaky  because what Motts is seeing is actually this. He's seeing his own brain. So Motts is doing something here  and probably he is going like this with his right hand  because the left side is activated on the motor cortex. And then he can see that at the same time. These visualizations are brand new. And this is something that we've been researching for a little while. This is another sequence of Motts' brain. And here we asked Motts to calculate backwards from    . So he's going             .  And then he's going backwards. And you can see how the little math processor is working up here in his brain and is lighting up the whole brain. Well this is fantastic. We can do this in real time. We can investigate things. We can tell him to do things. You can also see that his visual cortex is activated in the back of the head  because that's where he's seeing  he's seeing his own brain. And he's also hearing our instructions when we tell him to do things. The signal is really deep inside of the brain as well  and it's shining through  because all of the data is inside this volume. And in just a second here you will see    okay  here. Motts  now move your left foot. So he's going like this. For    seconds he's going like that  and all of a sudden it lights up up here. So we've got motor cortex activation up there. So this is really  really nice  and I think this is a great tool. And connecting also with the previous talk here  this is something that we could use as a tool to really understand how the neurons are working  how the brain is working  and we can do this with very  very high visual quality and very fast resolution. Now we're also having a bit of fun at the center. So this is a CAT scan    Computer Aided Tomography. So this is a lion from the local zoo outside of Norrkoping in Kolmarden  Elsa. So she came to the center  and they sedated her and then put her straight into the scanner. And then  of course  I get the whole data set from the lion. And I can do very nice images like this. I can peel off the layer of the lion. I can look inside of it. And we've been experimenting with this. And I think this is a great application for the future of this technology  because there's very little known about the animal anatomy. What's known out there for veterinarians is kind of basic information. We can scan all sorts of things  all sorts of animals. The only problem is to fit it into the machine. So here's a bear. It was kind of hard to get it in. And the bear is a cuddly  friendly animal. And here it is. Here is the nose of the bear. And you might want to cuddle this one  until you change the functions and look at this. So be aware of the bear. So with that  I'd like to thank all the people who have helped me to generate these images. It's a huge effort that goes into doing this  gathering the data and developing the algorithms  writing all the software. So  some very talented people. My motto is always  I only hire people that are smarter than I am and most of these are smarter than I am. So thank you very much. Some of the greatest innovations and developments in the world often happen at the intersection of two fields. So tonight I'd like to tell you about the intersection that I'm most excited about at this very moment  which is entertainment and robotics. So if we're trying to make robots that can be more expressive and that can connect better with us in society  maybe we should look to some of the human professionals of artificial emotion and personality that occur in the dramatic arts. I'm also interested in creating new technologies for the arts and to attract people to science and technology. Some people in the last decade or two have started creating artwork with technology. With my new venture  Marilyn Monrobot  I would like to use art to create tech. So we're based in New York City. And if you're a performer that wants to collaborate with an adorable robot  or if you have a robot that needs entertainment representation  please contact me  the Bot Agent. The bot  our rising celebrity  also has his own Twitter account   robotinthewild. I'd like to introduce you to one of our first robots  Data. He's named after the Star Trek character. I think he's going to be super popular. We've got the robot    in his head is a database of a lot of jokes. Now each of these jokes is labeled with certain attributes. So it knows something about the subject  it knows about the length. It knows how much it's moving. And so it's going to try to watch your response. I actually have no idea what my robot is going to do today. It can also learn from you about the quality of its jokes and cater things  sort of like Netflix style  over longer term to different communities or audiences  children versus adults  different cultures. You can learn something from the robot about the community that you're in. And also I can use each one of you as the acting coach to our future robot companions. Some of you in this middle section    you have red green paddles. If you like what's going on  show the green. If you don't like the subject or the performance  you can hold the red. Now don't be shy. It's just a robot. It doesn't have feelings ... yet. And the rest of you  you still count  you still matter. There's also a microphone that's listening to the aggregate laughter and applause and booing    I hope not    to help make some of its next decisions. Right  so  let the robot stand up comedy begin. Data  Hello TEDWomen. It's an honor to be here. You guys are looking good out there. Ready for some jokes  Audience  Yeah. Data  Here's the first one. Right  so  a doctor says to his patient   I have bad news and worse news. The bad news is that you only have    hours to live.   That's terrible   said the patient.  How can the news possibly be worse    I've been trying to contact you since yesterday.  The Swiss have an interesting army. Five hundred years without a war. Heather Knight  He's talking about the Swiss. Data  Pretty lucky for them. Ever see that little Swiss Army knife they have to fight with   Come on buddy  I have the toe clippers right here. You get past me  the guy behind me has a spoon.  HK  He's a French robot. Data  A couple of New Jersey hunters are out in the woods. One of them falls to the ground. He does not seem to be breathing. The other guy whips out his cell phone and calls    . He gasps to the operator   My friend is dead. What can I do   The operator says   Just take it easy. I can help. First  let's make sure he's dead.  There is a silence  and the operator hears a shot. The guy's voice comes back on the line   Okay  now what   Question  Why is television called a medium  Anyone  Because it's neither rare nor well done. But to be completely honest with you  I kind of love television. Any of you like television  Audience  Yes. Data  I find it incredibly educational. Actually  as soon as someone turns it on  I go into the other room and read. That's all for now. Was that okay for my first time  You've been a great audience. Thank you. HK  Yay. So this is actually the first time we've ever done live audience feedback to a performance. So thank you all for being a part of it. There's a lot more to come. And we hope to learn a lot about robot expression. Thank you very much. The world is changing with really remarkable speed. If you look at the chart at the top here  you'll see that in       these Goldman Sachs projections suggest that the Chinese economy will be almost the same size as the American economy. And if you look at the chart for       it's projected that the Chinese economy will be twice the size of the American economy  and the Indian economy will be almost the same size as the American economy. And we should bear in mind here that these projections were drawn up before the Western financial crisis. A couple of weeks ago  I was looking at the latest projection by BNP Paribas for when China will have a larger economy than the United States. Goldman Sachs projected     . The post crisis projection is     . That's just a decade away. China is going to change the world in two fundamental respects. First of all  it's a huge developing country with a population of  .  billion people  which has been growing for over    years at around    percent a year. And within a decade  it will have the largest economy in the world. Never before in the modern era has the largest economy in the world been that of a developing country  rather than a developed country. Secondly  for the first time in the modern era  the dominant country in the world    which I think is what China will become    will be not from the West and from very  very different civilizational roots. Now  I know it's a widespread assumption in the West that as countries modernize  they also westernize. This is an illusion. It's an assumption that modernity is a product simply of competition  markets and technology. It is not. It is also shaped equally by history and culture. China is not like the West  and it will not become like the West. It will remain in very fundamental respects very different. Now the big question here is obviously  how do we make sense of China  How do we try to understand what China is  And the problem we have in the West at the moment  by and large  is that the conventional approach is that we understand it really in Western terms  using Western ideas. We can't. Now I want to offer you three building blocks for trying to understand what China is like  just as a beginning. The first is this  that China is not really a nation state. Okay  it's called itself a nation state for the last hundred years  but everyone who knows anything about China knows it's a lot older than this. This was what China looked like with the victory of the Qin Dynasty in     B.C. at the end of the warring state period    the birth of modern China. And you can see it against the boundaries of modern China. Or immediately afterward  the Han Dynasty  still       years ago. And you can see already it occupies most of what we now know as Eastern China  which is where the vast majority of Chinese lived then and live now. Now what is extraordinary about this is  what gives China its sense of being China  what gives the Chinese the sense of what it is to be Chinese  comes not from the last hundred years  not from the nation state period  which is what happened in the West  but from the period  if you like  of the civilization state. I'm thinking here  for example  of customs like ancestral worship  of a very distinctive notion of the state  likewise  a very distinctive notion of the family  social relationships like guanxi  Confucian values and so on. These are all things that come from the period of the civilization state. In other words  China  unlike the Western states and most countries in the world  is shaped by its sense of civilization  its existence as a civilization state  rather than as a nation state. And there's one other thing to add to this  and that is this  Of course we know China's big  huge  demographically and geographically  with a population of  .  billion people. What we often aren't really aware of is the fact that China is extremely diverse and very pluralistic  and in many ways very decentralized. You can't run a place on this scale simply from Beijing  even though we think this to be the case. It's never been the case. So this is China  a civilization state  rather than a nation state. And what does it mean  Well  I think it has all sorts of profound implications. I'll give you two quick ones. The first is that the most important political value for the Chinese is unity  is the maintenance of Chinese civilization. You know        years ago  Europe  breakdown    the fragmentation of the Holy Roman Empire. It divided  and it's remained divided ever since. China  over the same time period  went in exactly the opposite direction  very painfully holding this huge civilization  civilization state  together. The second is maybe more prosaic  which is Hong Kong. Do you remember the handover of Hong Kong by Britain to China in       You may remember what the Chinese constitutional proposition was. One country  two systems. And I'll lay a wager that barely anyone in the West believed them.  Window dressing. When China gets its hands on Hong Kong  that won't be the case.  Thirteen years on  the political and legal system in Hong Kong is as different now as it was in     . We were wrong. Why were we wrong  We were wrong because we thought  naturally enough  in nation state ways. Think of German unification      . What happened  Well  basically the East was swallowed by the West. One nation  one system. That is the nation state mentality. But you can't run a country like China  a civilization state  on the basis of one civilization  one system. It doesn't work. So actually the response of China to the question of Hong Kong    as it will be to the question of Taiwan    was a natural response  one civilization  many systems. Let me offer you another building block to try and understand China    maybe not sort of a comfortable one. The Chinese have a very  very different conception of race to most other countries. Do you know  of the  .  billion Chinese  over    percent of them think they belong to the same race  the Han  Now  this is completely different from the world's  other  most populous countries. India  the United States  Indonesia  Brazil    all of them are multiracial. The Chinese don't feel like that. China is only multiracial really at the margins. So the question is  why  Well the reason  I think  essentially is  again  back to the civilization state. A history of at least       years  a history of conquest  occupation  absorption  assimilation and so on  led to the process by which  over time  this notion of the Han emerged    of course  nurtured by a growing and very powerful sense of cultural identity. Now the great advantage of this historical experience has been that  without the Han  China could never have held together. The Han identity has been the cement which has held this country together. The great disadvantage of it is that the Han have a very weak conception of cultural difference. They really believe in their own superiority  and they are disrespectful of those who are not. Hence their attitude  for example  to the Uyghurs and to the Tibetans. Or let me give you my third building block  the Chinese state. Now the relationship between the state and society in China is very different from that in the West. Now we in the West overwhelmingly seem to think    in these days at least    that the authority and legitimacy of the state is a function of democracy. The problem with this proposition is that the Chinese state enjoys more legitimacy and more authority amongst the Chinese than is true with any Western state. And the reason for this is because    well  there are two reasons  I think. And it's obviously got nothing to do with democracy  because in our terms the Chinese certainly don't have a democracy. And the reason for this is  firstly  because the state in China is given a very special    it enjoys a very special significance as the representative  the embodiment and the guardian of Chinese civilization  of the civilization state. This is as close as China gets to a kind of spiritual role. And the second reason is because  whereas in Europe and North America  the state's power is continuously challenged    I mean in the European tradition  historically against the church  against other sectors of the aristocracy  against merchants and so on    for       years  the power of the Chinese state has not been challenged. It's had no serious rivals. So you can see that the way in which power has been constructed in China is very different from our experience in Western history. The result  by the way  is that the Chinese have a very different view of the state. Whereas we tend to view it as an intruder  a stranger  certainly an organ whose powers need to be limited or defined and constrained  the Chinese don't see the state like that at all. The Chinese view the state as an intimate    not just as an intimate actually  as a member of the family    not just in fact as a member of the family  but as the head of the family  the patriarch of the family. This is the Chinese view of the state    very  very different to ours. It's embedded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the West. And I would suggest to you that actually what we are dealing with here  in the Chinese context  is a new kind of paradigm  which is different from anything we've had to think about in the past. Know that China believes in the market and the state. I mean  Adam Smith  already writing in the late   th century  said   The Chinese market is larger and more developed and more sophisticated than anything in Europe.  And  apart from the Mao period  that has remained more or less the case ever since. But this is combined with an extremely strong and ubiquitous state. The state is everywhere in China. I mean  it's leading firms    many of them are still publicly owned. Private firms  however large they are  like Lenovo  depend in many ways on state patronage. Targets for the economy and so on are set by the state. And the state  of course  its authority flows into lots of other areas    as we are familiar with    with something like the one child policy. Moreover  this is a very old state tradition  a very old tradition of statecraft. I mean  if you want an illustration of this  the Great Wall is one. But this is another  this is the Grand Canal  which was constructed in the first instance in the fifth century B.C. and was finally completed in the seventh century A.D. It went for       miles  linking Beijing with Hangzhou and Shanghai. So there's a long history of extraordinary state infrastructural projects in China  which I suppose helps us to explain what we see today  which is something like the Three Gorges Dam and many other expressions of state competence within China. So there we have three building blocks for trying to understand the difference that is China    the civilization state  the notion of race and the nature of the state and its relationship to society. And yet we still insist  by and large  in thinking that we can understand China by simply drawing on Western experience  looking at it through Western eyes  using Western concepts. If you want to know why we unerringly seem to get China wrong    our predictions about what's going to happen to China are incorrect    this is the reason. Unfortunately  I think  I have to say that I think attitude towards China is that of a kind of little Westerner mentality. It's kind of arrogant. It's arrogant in the sense that we think that we are best  and therefore we have the universal measure. And secondly  it's ignorant. We refuse to really address the issue of difference. You know  there's a very interesting passage in a book by Paul Cohen  the American historian. And Paul Cohen argues that the West thinks of itself as probably the most cosmopolitan of all cultures. But it's not. In many ways  it's the most parochial  because for     years  the West has been so dominant in the world that it's not really needed to understand other cultures  other civilizations. Because  at the end of the day  it could  if necessary by force  get its own way. Whereas those cultures    virtually the rest of the world  in fact  which have been in a far weaker position  vis a vis the West    have been thereby forced to understand the West  because of the West's presence in those societies. And therefore  they are  as a result  more cosmopolitan in many ways than the West. I mean  take the question of East Asia. East Asia  Japan  Korea  China  etc.    a third of the world's population lives there. Now the largest economic region in the world. And I'll tell you now  that East Asianers  people from East Asia  are far more knowledgeable about the West than the West is about East Asia. Now this point is very germane  I'm afraid  to the present. Because what's happening  Back to that chart at the beginning  the Goldman Sachs chart. What is happening is that  very rapidly in historical terms  the world is being driven and shaped  not by the old developed countries  but by the developing world. We've seen this in terms of the G   usurping very rapidly the position of the G   or the G . And there are two consequences of this. First  the West is rapidly losing its influence in the world. There was a dramatic illustration of this actually a year ago    Copenhagen  climate change conference. Europe was not at the final negotiating table. When did that last happen  I would wager it was probably about     years ago. And that is what is going to happen in the future. And the second implication is that the world will inevitably  as a consequence  become increasingly unfamiliar to us  because it'll be shaped by cultures and experiences and histories that we are not really familiar with  or conversant with. And at last  I'm afraid    take Europe  America is slightly different    but Europeans by and large  I have to say  are ignorant  are unaware about the way the world is changing. Some people    I've got an English friend in China  and he said   The continent is sleepwalking into oblivion.  Well  maybe that's true  maybe that's an exaggeration. But there's another problem which goes along with this    that Europe is increasingly out of touch with the world    and that is a sort of loss of a sense of the future. I mean  Europe once  of course  once commanded the future in its confidence. Take the   th century  for example. But this  alas  is no longer true. If you want to feel the future  if you want to taste the future  try China    there's old Confucius. This is a railway station the likes of which you've never seen before. It doesn't even look like a railway station. This is the new  Wuhan  railway station for the high speed trains. China already has a bigger network than any other country in the world and will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together. Or take this  now this is an idea  but it's an idea to be tried out shortly in a suburb of Beijing. Here you have a megabus  on the upper deck carries about       people. It travels on rails down a suburban road  and the cars travel underneath it. And it does speeds of up to about     miles an hour. Now this is the way things are going to move  because China has a very specific problem  which is different from Europe and different from the United States  China has huge numbers of people and no space. So this is a solution to a situation where China's going to have many  many  many cities over    million people. Okay  so how would I like to finish  Well  what should our attitude be towards this world that we see very rapidly developing before us  I think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it. But I want to argue  above all  a big picture positive for this world. For     years  the world was essentially governed by a fragment of the human population. That's what Europe and North America represented. The arrival of countries like China and India    between them    percent of the world's population    and others like Indonesia and Brazil and so on  represent the most important single act of democratization in the last     years. Civilizations and cultures  which had been ignored  which had no voice  which were not listened to  which were not known about  will have a different sort of representation in this world. As humanists  we must welcome  surely  this transformation  and we will have to learn about these civilizations. This big ship here was the one sailed in by Zheng He in the early   th century on his great voyages around the South China Sea  the East China Sea and across the Indian Ocean to East Africa. The little boat in front of it was the one in which     years later  Christopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic. Or  look carefully at this silk scroll made by ZhuZhou in     . I think they're playing golf. Christ  the Chinese even invented golf. Welcome to the future. Thank you. I'm going to be talking to you about how we can tap a really underutilized resource in health care  which is the patient  or  as I like to use the scientific term  people. Because we are all patients  we are all people. Even doctors are patients at some point. So I want to talk about that as an opportunity that we really have failed to engage with very well in this country and  in fact  worldwide. If you want to get at the big part    I mean from a public health level  where my training is    you're looking at behavioral issues. You're looking at things where people are actually given information  and they're not following through with it. It's a problem that manifests itself in diabetes  obesity  many forms of heart disease  even some forms of cancer    when you think of smoking. Those are all behaviors where people know what they're supposed to do. They know what they're supposed to be doing  but they're not doing it. Now behavior change is something that is a long standing problem in medicine. It goes all the way back to Aristotle. And doctors hate it  right  I mean  they complain about it all the time. We talk about it in terms of engagement  or non compliance. When people don't take their pills  when people don't follow doctors' orders    these are behavior problems. But for as much as clinical medicine agonizes over behavior change  there's not a lot of work done in terms of trying to fix that problem. So the crux of it comes down to this notion of decision making    giving information to people in a form that doesn't just educate them or inform them  but actually leads them to make better decisions  better choices in their lives. One part of medicine  though  has faced the problem of behavior change pretty well  and that's dentistry. Dentistry might seem    and I think it is    many dentists would have to acknowledge it's somewhat of a mundane backwater of medicine. Not a lot of cool  sexy stuff happening in dentistry. But they have really taken this problem of behavior change and solved it. It's the one great preventive health success we have in our health care system. People brush and floss their teeth. They don't do it as much as they should  but they do it. So I'm going to talk about one experiment that a few dentists in Connecticut cooked up about    years ago. So this is an old experiment  but it's a really good one  because it was very simple  so it's an easy story to tell. So these Connecticut dentists decided that they wanted to get people to brush their teeth and floss their teeth more often  and they were going to use one variable  they wanted to scare them. They wanted to tell them how bad it would be if they didn't brush and floss their teeth. They had a big patient population. They divided them up into two groups. They had a low fear population  where they basically gave them a    minute presentation  all based in science  but told them that  if you didn't brush and floss your teeth  you could get gum disease. If you get gum disease  you will lose your teeth  but you'll get dentures  and it won't be that bad. So that was the low fear group. The high fear group  they laid it on really thick. They showed bloody gums. They showed puss oozing out from between their teeth. They told them that their teeth were going to fall out. They said that they could have infections that would spread from their jaws to other parts of their bodies  and ultimately  yes  they would lose their teeth. They would get dentures  and if you got dentures  you weren't going to be able to eat corn on the cob  you weren't going to be able to eat apples  you weren't going to be able to eat steak. You'll eat mush for the rest of your life. So go brush and floss your teeth. That was the message. That was the experiment. Now they measured one other variable. They wanted to capture one other variable  which was the patients' sense of efficacy. This was the notion of whether the patients felt that they actually would go ahead and brush and floss their teeth. So they asked them at the beginning   Do you think you'll actually be able to stick with this program   And the people who said   Yeah  yeah. I'm pretty good about that   they were characterized as high efficacy  and the people who said   Eh  I never get around to brushing and flossing as much as I should   they were characterized as low efficacy. So the upshot was this. The upshot of this experiment was that fear was not really a primary driver of the behavior at all. The people who brushed and flossed their teeth were not necessarily the people who were really scared about what would happen    it's the people who simply felt that they had the capacity to change their behavior. So fear showed up as not really the driver. It was the sense of efficacy. So I want to isolate this  because it was a great observation       years ago  right     years ago    and it's one that's laid fallow in research. It was a notion that really came out of Albert Bandura's work  who studied whether people could get a sense of empowerment. The notion of efficacy basically boils down to one    that if somebody believes that they have the capacity to change their behavior. In health care terms  you could characterize this as whether or not somebody feels that they see a path towards better health  that they can actually see their way towards getting better health  and that's a very important notion. It's an amazing notion. We don't really know how to manipulate it  though  that well. Except  maybe we do. So fear doesn't work  right  Fear doesn't work. And this is a great example of how we haven't learned that lesson at all. This is a campaign from the American Diabetes Association. This is still the way we're communicating messages about health. I mean  I showed my three year old this slide last night  and he's like   Papa  why is an ambulance in these people's homes   And I had to explain   They're trying to scare people.  And I don't know if it works. Now here's what does work  personalized information works. Again  Bandura recognized this years ago  decades ago. When you give people specific information about their health  where they stand  and where they want to get to  where they might get to  that path  that notion of a path    that tends to work for behavior change. So let me just spool it out a little bit. So you start with personalized data  personalized information that comes from an individual  and then you need to connect it to their lives. You need to connect it to their lives  hopefully not in a fear based way  but one that they understand. Okay  I know where I sit. I know where I'm situated. And that doesn't just work for me in terms of abstract numbers    this overload of health information that we're inundated with. But it actually hits home. It's not just hitting us in our heads  it's hitting us in our hearts. There's an emotional connection to information because it's from us. That information then needs to be connected to choices  needs to be connected to a range of options  directions that we might go to    trade offs  benefits. Finally  we need to be presented with a clear point of action. We need to connect the information always with the action  and then that action feeds back into different information  and it creates  of course  a feedback loop. Now this is a very well observed and well established notion for behavior change. But the problem is that things    in the upper right corner there    personalized data  it's been pretty hard to come by. It's a difficult and expensive commodity  until now. So I'm going to give you an example  a very simple example of how this works. So we've all seen these. These are the  your speed limit  signs. You've seen them all around  especially these days as radars are cheaper. And here's how they work in the feedback loop. So you start with the personalized data where the speed limit on the road that you are at that point is     and  of course  you're going faster than that. We always are. We're always going above the speed limit. The choice in this case is pretty simple. We either keep going fast  or we slow down. We should probably slow down  and that point of action is probably now. We should take our foot off the pedal right now  and generally we do. These things are shown to be pretty effective in terms of getting people to slow down. They reduce speeds by about five to    percent. They last for about five miles  in which case we put our foot back on the pedal. But it works  and it even has some health repercussions. Your blood pressure might drop a little bit. Maybe there's fewer accidents  so there's public health benefits. But by and large  this is a feedback loop that's so nifty and too rare. Because in health care  most health care  the data is very removed from the action. It's very difficult to line things up so neatly. But we have an opportunity. So I want to talk about  I want to shift now to think about how we deliver health information in this country  how we actually get information. This is a pharmaceutical ad. Actually  it's a spoof. It's not a real pharmaceutical ad. Nobody's had the brilliant idea of calling their drug Havidol quite yet. But it looks completely right. So it's exactly the way we get health information and pharmaceutical information  and it just sounds perfect. And then we turn the page of the magazine  and we see this    now this is the page the FDA requires pharmaceutical companies to put into their ads  or to follow their ads  and to me  this is one of the most  cynical exercises in medicine. Because we know. Who among us would actually say that people read this  And who among us would actually say that people who do try to read this actually get anything out of it  This is a bankrupt effort at communicating health information. There is no good faith in this. So this is a different approach. This is an approach that has been developed by a couple researchers at Dartmouth Medical School  Lisa Schwartz and Steven Woloshin. And they created this thing called the  drug facts box.  They took inspiration from  of all things  Cap'n Crunch. They went to the nutritional information box and saw that what works for cereal  works for our food  actually helps people understand what's in their food. God forbid we should use that same standard that we make Cap'n Crunch live by and bring it to drug companies. So let me just walk through this quickly. It says very clearly what the drug is for  specifically who it is good for  so you can start to personalize your understanding of whether the information is relevant to you or whether the drug is relevant to you. You can understand exactly what the benefits are. It isn't this kind of vague promise that it's going to work no matter what  but you get the statistics for how effective it is. And finally  you understand what those choices are. You can start to unpack the choices involved because of the side effects. Every time you take a drug  you're walking into a possible side effect. So it spells those out in very clean terms  and that works. So I love this. I love that drug facts box. And so I was thinking about  what's an opportunity that I could have to help people understand information  What's another latent body of information that's out there that people are really not putting to use  And so I came up with this  lab test results. Blood test results are this great source of information. They're packed with information. They're just not for us. They're not for people. They're not for patients. They go right to doctors. And God forbid    I think many doctors  if you really asked them  they don't really understand all this stuff either. This is the worst presented information. You ask Tufte  and he would say   Yes  this is the absolute worst presentation of information possible.  What we did at Wired was we went  and I got our graphic design department to re imagine these lab reports. So that's what I want to walk you through. So this is the general blood work before  and this is the after  this is what we came up with. The after takes what was four pages    that previous slide was actually the first of four pages of data that's just the general blood work. It goes on and on and on  all these values  all these numbers you don't know. This is our one page summary. We use the notion of color. It's an amazing notion that color could be used. So on the top level you have your overall results  the things that might jump out at you from the fine print. Then you can drill down and understand how actually we put your level in context  and we use color to illustrate exactly where your value falls. In this case  this patient is slightly at risk of diabetes because of their glucose level. Likewise  you can go over your lipids and  again  understand what your overall cholesterol level is and then break down into the HDL and the LDL if you so choose. But again  always using color and personalized proximity to that information. All those other values  all those pages and pages of values that are full of nothing  we summarize. We tell you that you're okay  you're normal. But you don't have to wade through it. You don't have to go through the junk. And then we do two other very important things that kind of help fill in this feedback loop  we help people understand in a little more detail what these values are and what they might indicate. And then we go a further step    we tell them what they can do. We give them some insight into what choices they can make  what actions they can take. So that's our general blood work test. Then we went to CRP test. In this case  it's a sin of omission. They have this huge amount of space  and they don't use it for anything  so we do. Now the CRP test is often done following a cholesterol test  or in conjunction with a cholesterol test. So we take the bold step of putting the cholesterol information on the same page  which is the way the doctor is going to evaluate it. So we thought the patient might actually want to know the context as well. It's a protein that shows up when your blood vessels might be inflamed  which might be a risk for heart disease. What you're actually measuring is spelled out in clean language. Then we use the information that's already in the lab report. We use the person's age and their gender to start to fill in the personalized risks. So we start to use the data we have to run a very simple calculation that's on all sorts of online calculators to get a sense of what the actual risk is. The last one I'll show you is a PSA test. Here's the before  and here's the after. Now a lot of our effort on this one    as many of you probably know  a PSA test is a very controversial test. It's used to test for prostate cancer  but there are all sorts of reasons why your prostate might be enlarged. And so we spent a good deal of our time indicating that. We again personalized the risks. So this patient is in their   s  so we can actually give them a very precise estimate of what their risk for prostate cancer is. In this case it's about    percent  based on that. And then again  the follow up actions. So our cost for this was less than        dollars  all right. That's what Wired magazine spent on this. Why is Wired magazine doing this  Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp  the two largest lab testing companies    last year  they made profits of over     million dollars and over     million dollars respectively. Now this is not a problem of resources  this is a problem of incentives. We need to recognize that the target of this information should not be the doctor  should not be the insurance company. It should be the patient. It's the person who actually  in the end  is going to be having to change their lives and then start adopting new behaviors. This is information that is incredibly powerful. It's an incredibly powerful catalyst to change. But we're not using it. It's just sitting there. It's being lost. So I want to just offer four questions that every patient should ask  because I don't actually expect people to start developing these lab test reports. But you can create your own feedback loop. Anybody can create their feedback loop by asking these simple questions  Can I have my results  And the only acceptable answer is    What does this mean  Help me understand what the data is. What are my options  What choices are now on the table  And then  what's next  How do I integrate this information into the longer course of my life  So I want to wind up by just showing that people have the capacity to understand this information. This is not beyond the grasp of ordinary people. You do not need to have the education level of people in this room. Ordinary people are capable of understanding this information  if we only go to the effort of presenting it to them in a form that they can engage with. And engagement is essential here  because it's not just giving them information  it's giving them an opportunity to act. That's what engagement is. It's different from compliance. It works totally different from the way we talk about behavior in medicine today. And this information is out there. I've been talking today about latent information  all this information that exists in the system that we're not putting to use. But there are all sorts of other bodies of information that are coming online  and we need to recognize the capacity of this information to engage people  to help people and to change the course of their lives. Thank you very much. I was afraid of womanhood. Not that I'm not afraid now  but I've learned to pretend. I've learned to be flexible. In fact  I've developed some interesting tools to help me deal with this fear. Let me explain. Back in the '  s and '  s  when I was growing up  little girls were supposed to be kind and thoughtful and pretty and gentle and soft  and we were supposed to fit into roles that were sort of shadowy    really not quite clear what we were supposed to be. There were plenty of role models all around us. We had our mothers  our aunts  our cousins  our sisters  and of course  the ever present media bombarding us with images and words  telling us how to be. Now my mother was different. She was a homemaker  but she and I didn't go out and do girlie things together  and she didn't buy me pink outfits. Instead  she knew what I needed  and she bought me a book of cartoons. And I just ate it up. I drew  and I drew  and since I knew that humor was acceptable in my family  I could draw  do what I wanted to do  and not have to perform  not have to speak    I was very shy    and I could still get approval. I was launched as a cartoonist. Now when we're young  we don't always know. We know there are rules out there  but we don't always know    we don't perform them right  even though we are imprinted at birth with these things  and we're told what the most important color in the world is. We're told what shape we're supposed to be in. We're told what to wear       and how to do our hair       and how to behave. Now the rules that I'm talking about are constantly being monitored by the culture. We're being corrected  and the primary policemen are women  because we are the carriers of the tradition. We pass it down from generation to generation. Not only that    we always have this vague notion that something's expected of us. And on top of all off these rules  they keep changing. We don't know what's going on half the time  so it puts us in a very tenuous position. Now if you don't like these rules  and many of us don't    I know I didn't  and I still don't  even though I follow them half the time  not quite aware that I'm following them    what better way than to change them  than  with humor  Humor relies on the traditions of a society. It takes what we know  and it twists it. It takes the codes of behavior and the codes of dress  and it makes it unexpected  and that's what elicits a laugh. Now what if you put together women and humor  I think you can get change. Because women are on the ground floor  and we know the traditions so well  we can bring a different voice to the table. Now I started drawing in the middle of a lot of chaos. I grew up not far from here in Washington D.C. during the Civil Rights movement  the assassinations  the Watergate hearings and then the feminist movement  and I think I was drawing  trying to figure out what was going on. And then also my family was in chaos  and I drew to try to bring my family together       try to bring my family together with laughter. It didn't work. My parents got divorced  and my sister was arrested. But I found my place. I found that I didn't have to wear high heels  I didn't have to wear pink  and I could feel like I fit in. Now when I was a little older  in my   s  I realized there are not many women in cartooning. And I thought   Well  maybe I can break the little glass ceiling of cartooning   and so I did. I became a cartoonist. And then I thought    in my   s I started thinking   Well  why don't I do something  I always loved political cartoons  so why don't I do something with the content of my cartoons to make people think about the stupid rules that we're following as well as laugh   Now my perspective is a particularly       my perspective is a particularly American perspective. I can't help it. I live here. Even though I've traveled a lot  I still think like an American woman. But I believe that the rules that I'm talking about are universal  of course    that each culture has its different codes of behavior and dress and traditions  and each woman has to deal with these same things that we do here in the U.S. Consequently  we have. Women  because we're on the ground  we know the tradition. We have amazing antennae. Now my work lately has been to collaborate with international cartoonists  which I so enjoy  and it's given me a greater appreciation for the power of cartoons to get at the truth  to get at the issues quickly and succinctly. And not only that  it can get to the viewer through not only the intellect  but through the heart. My work also has allowed me to collaborate with women cartoonists from across the world    countries such as Saudi Arabia  Iran  Turkey  Argentina  France    and we have sat together and laughed and talked and shared our difficulties. And these women are working so hard to get their voices heard in some very difficult circumstances. But I feel blessed to be able to work with them. And we talk about how women have such strong perceptions  because of our tenuous position and our role as tradition keepers  that we can have the great potential to be change agents. And I think  I truly believe  that we can change this thing one laugh at a time. Thank you. The maxim   Know thyself  has been around since the ancient Greeks. Some attribute this golden world knowledge to Plato  others to Pythagoras. But the truth is it doesn't really matter which sage said it first  because it's still sage advice  even today.  Know thyself.  It's pithy almost to the point of being meaningless  but it rings familiar and true  doesn't it   Know thyself.  I understand this timeless dictum as a statement about the problems  or more exactly the confusions  of consciousness. I've always been fascinated with knowing the self. This fascination led me to submerge myself in art  study neuroscience and later to become a psychotherapist. Today I combine all my passions as the CEO of InteraXon  a thought controlled computing company. My goal  quite simply  is to help people become more in tune with themselves. I take it from this little dictum   Know thyself.  If you think about it  this imperative is kind of the defining characteristic of our species  isn't it  I mean  it's self awareness that separates Homo sapiens from earlier instances of our mankind. Today we're often too busy tending to our iPhones and iPods to really stop and get to know ourselves. Under the deluge of minute to minute text conversations  emails  relentless exchange of media channels and passwords and apps and reminders and Tweets and tags  we lose sight of what all this fuss is supposed to be about in the first place  ourselves. Much of the time we're transfixed by all of the ways we can reflect ourselves into the world. And we can barely find the time to reflect deeply back in on our own selves. We've cluttered ourselves up with all this. And we feel like we have to get far  far away to a secluded retreat  leaving it all behind. So we go far away to the top of a mountain  assuming that perching ourselves on a piece is bound to give us the respite we need to sort the clutter  the chaotic everyday  and find ourselves again. But on that mountain where we gain that beautiful peace of mind  what are we really achieving  It's really only a successful escape. Think of the term we use   Retreat.  This is the term that armies use when they've lost a battle. It means we've got to get out of here. Is this how we feel about the pressures of our world  that in order to get inside ourselves  you have to run for the hills  And the problem with escaping your day to day life is that you have to come home eventually. So when you think about it  we're almost like a tourist visiting ourselves over there. And eventually that vacation's got to come to an end. So my question to you is  can we find ways to know ourselves without the escape  Can we redefine our relationship with the technologized world in order to have the heightened sense of self awareness that we seek  Can we live here and now in our wired web and still follow those ancient instructions   Know thyself   I say the answer is yes. And I'm here today to share a new way that we're working with technology to this end to get familiar with our inner self like never before    humanizing technology and furthering that age old quest of ours to more fully know the self. It's called thought controlled computing. You may or may not have noticed that I'm wearing a tiny electrode on my forehead. This is actually a brainwave sensor that's reading the electrical activity of my brain as I give this talk. These brainwaves are being analyzed and we can see them as a graph. Let me show you what it looks like. That blue line there is my brainwave. It's the direct signal being recorded from my head  rendered in real time. The green and red bars show that same signal displayed by frequency  with lower frequencies here and higher frequencies up here. You're actually looking inside my head as I speak. These graphs are compelling  they're undulating  but from a human's perspective  they're actually not very useful. That's why we've spent a lot of time thinking about how to make this data meaningful to the people who use it. For instance  what if I could use this data to find out how relaxed I am at any moment  Or what if I can take that information and put it into an organic shape up on the screen  The shape on the right over here has become an indicator of what's going on in my head. The more relaxed I am  the more the energy's going to fall through it. I may also be interested in knowing how focused I am  so I can put my level of attention into the circuit board on the other side. And the more focused my brain is  the more the circuit board is going to surge with energy. Ordinarily  I would have no way of knowing how focused or relaxed I was in any tangible way. As we know  our feelings about how we're feeling are notoriously unreliable. We've all had stress creep up on us without even noticing it until we lost it on someone who didn't deserve it  and then we realize that we probably should have checked in with ourselves a little earlier. This new awareness opens up vast possibilities for applications that help improve our lives and ourselves. We're trying to create technology that uses the insights to make our work more efficient  our breaks more relaxing and our connections deeper and more fulfilling than ever. I'm going to share some of these visions with you in a bit  but first I want to take a look at how we got here. By the way  feel free to check in on my head at any time. My team at InteraXon and I have been developing throught controlled application for almost a decade now. In the first phase of development we were really enthused by all the things we could control with our mind. We were making things activate  light up and work just by thinking. We were transcending the space between the mind and the device. We brought to life a vast array of prototypes and products that you could control with your mind  like thought controlled home appliances or slot car games or video games or a levitating chair. We created technology and applications that engaged people's imaginations  and it was really exciting. And then we were asked to do something really big for the Olympics. We were invited to create a massive installation at the Vancouver      winter Olympics  were used in Vancouver  got to control the lighting on the C.N. Tower  the Canadian Parliament buildings and Niagara Falls from all the way across the country using their minds. Over    days at the Olympics       visitors from all over the world actually got to individually control the light from the C.N. Tower  parliament and Niagara in real time with their minds from across the country        km away. So controlling stuff with your mind is pretty cool. But we're always interested in multi tiered levels of human interaction. And so we began looking into inventing thought controlled applications in a more complex frame than just control. And that was responsiveness. We realized that we had a system that allowed technology to know something about you. And it could join into the relationship with you. We created the responsive room where the lights music and blinds adjusted to your state. They followed these little shifts in your mental activity. So as you settled into relaxation at the end of a hard day  on the couch in our office  the music would mellow with you. When you read  the desk lamp would get brighter. If you nod off  the system would know  dimming to darkness as you do. We then realized that if technology could know something about you and use it to help you  there's an even more valuable application than that. That you could know something about yourself. We could know sides of ourselves that were all but invisible and come to see things that were previously hidden. Let me show you an example of what I'm talking about here. Here's an application that I created for the iPad. So the goal of the original game Zen Bound is to wrap a rope around a wooden form. So you use it with your headset. The headset connects wirelessly to an iPad or a smartphone. In that headset you have fabric sensors on your forehead and above the ear. In the original Zen Bound game  you play it by scrolling your fingers over the pad. In the game that we created  of course  you control the wooden form that's on the screen there with your mind. As you focus on the wooden form  it rotates. The more you focus  the faster the rotation. This is for real. This is not a fake. What's really interesting to me though is at the end of the game you get stats and feedback about how you did. You have graphs and charts that tell you how your brain was doing    not just how much rope you used or what your high score is  but what was going on inside of your mind. And this is valuable feedback that we can use to understand what's going on inside of ourselves. I like to call this  intra active.  Normally we think about technology as interactive. This technology is intra active. It understands what's inside of you and builds a sort of responsive relationship between you and your technology so that you can use this information to move you forward. So you can use this information to understand you in a responsive loop. At InteraXon  intra active technology is one of our really defining mandates. It's how we understand the world inside and reflect it outside into this tight loop. For example  thought controlled computing can teach children with ADD how to improve their focus. With ADD  children have a low proportion of beta waves for focus states and a high proportion of theta states. So you can create applications that reward focused brain states. So you can imagine kids playing video games with their brain waves and improving their ADD symptoms as they do it. This can be as effective as Ritalin. Perhaps even more importantly  thought controlled computing can give children with ADD insights into their own fluctuating mental states  so they can better understand themselves and their learning needs. The way these children will be able to use their new awareness to improve themselves will upend many of the damaging and widespread social stigmas that people who are diagnosed as different are challenged with. We can peer inside our heads and interact with what was once locked away from us  what once mystified and separated us. Brainwave technology can understand us  anticipate our emotions and find the best solutions for our needs. Imagine this collected awareness of the individual computed and reflected across an entire lifespan. Imagine the insights that you can gain from this kind of second sight. It would be like plugging into your own personal Google. On the subject of Google  today you can search and tag images based on the thoughts and feelings you had while you watched them. You can tag pictures of baby animals as happy  or whatever baby animals are to you  and then you can search that database  navigating with your feelings  rather than the keywords that just hint at them. Or you could tag Facebook photos with the emotions that you had associated with those memories and then instantly prioritize the streams that catch your attention  just like this. Humanizing technology is about taking what's already natural about the human tech experience and building technology seamlessly in tandem with it. As it aligns with our human behaviors  it can allow us to make better sense of what we do and  more importantly  why  creating a big picture out of all the important little details that make up who we are. With humanized technology we can monitor the quality of your sleep cycles. When our productivity starts to slacken  we can go back to that data and see how we can make more effective balance between work and play. Do you know what causes fatigue in you or what brings out your energetic self  what triggers cause you to be depressed or what fun things are going to bring you out of that funk  Imagine if you had access to data that allowed you to rank on a scale of overall happiness which people in your life made you the happiest  or what activities brought you joy. Would you make more time for those people  Would you prioritize  Would you get a divorce  What thought controlled computing can allow you to do is build colorful layered pictures of our lives. And with this  we can get the skinny on our psychological happenings and build a story of our behaviors over time. We can begin to see the underlying narratives that propel us forward and tell us about what's going on. And from this  we can learn how to change the plot  the outcome and the character of our personal stories. Two millennia ago  those Greeks had some powerful insights. They knew that a fundamental piece falls into place when you start to live out their little phrase  when you come into contact with yourself. They understood the power of human narrative and the value that we place on humans as changing  evolving and growing. But they understood something more fundamental    the sheer joy in discovery  the delight and fascination that we get from the world and being ourselves in it  the richness that we get from seeing  feeling and knowing the lives that we are. My mom's an artist  and as a child I'd often see her bring things to life with the stroke of a brush. One moment it was all white space  pure possibility. The next  it was alive with her colorful ideas and expressions. As I sat easel side  watching her transform canvas after canvas  I learned that you could create your own world. I learned that our own inner worlds    our ideas  emotions and imaginations    were  in fact  not bound by our brains and bodies. If you could think it  if you could discover it  you could bring it to life. To me  thought controlled computing is as simple and powerful as a paintbrush    one more tool to unlock and enliven the hidden worlds within us. I look forward to the day that I can sit beside you  easel side  watching the world that we can create with our new toolboxes and the discoveries that we can make about ourselves. Thank you. My story actually began when I was four years old and my family moved to a new neighborhood in our hometown of Savannah  Georgia. And this was the     s when actually all the streets in this neighborhood were named after Confederate war generals. We lived on Robert E. Lee Boulevard. And when I was five  my parents gave me an orange Schwinn Sting Ray bicycle. It had a swooping banana seat and those ape hanger handlebars that made the rider look like an orangutan. That's why they were called ape hangers. They were actually modeled on hotrod motorcycles of the     s  which I'm sure my mom didn't know. And one day I was exploring this cul de sac hidden away a few streets away. And I came back  and I wanted to turn around and get back to that street more quickly  so I decided to turn around in this big street that intersected our neighborhood  and wham  I was hit by a passing sedan. My mangled body flew in one direction  my mangled bike flew in the other. And I lay on the pavement stretching over that yellow line  and one of my neighbors came running over.  Andy  Andy  how are you doing   she said  using the name of my older brother.  I'm Bruce   I said  and promptly passed out. I broke my left femur that day    it's the largest bone in your body    and spent the next two months in a body cast that went from my chin to the tip of my toe to my right knee  and a steel bar went from my right knee to my left ankle. And for the next    years  that accident was the only medically interesting thing that ever happened to me. In fact  I made a living by walking. I traveled around the world  entered different cultures  wrote a series of books about my travels  including  Walking the Bible.  I hosted a television show by that name on PBS. I was  for all the world  the  walking guy.  Until  in May       a routine visit to my doctor and a routine blood test produced evidence in the form of an alkaline phosphatase number that something might be wrong with my bones. And my doctor  on a whim  sent me to get a full body bone scan  which showed that there was some growth in my left leg. That sent me to an X ray  then to an MRI. And one afternoon  I got a call from my doctor.  The tumor in your leg is not consistent with a benign tumor.  I stopped walking  and it took my mind a second to convert that double negative into a much more horrifying negative. I have cancer. And to think that the tumor was in the same bone  in the same place in my body as the accident    years earlier    it seemed like too much of a coincidence. So that afternoon  I went back to my house  and my three year old identical twin daughters  Eden and Tybee Feiler  came running to meet me. They'd just turned three  and they were into all things pink and purple. In fact  we called them Pinkalicious and Purplicious    although I must say  our favorite nickname occurred on their birthday  April   th. When they were born at      and      on April           our otherwise grim  humorless doctor looked at his watch  and was like   Hmm  April   th    tax day. Early filer and late filer.  The next day I came to see him. I was like   Doctor  that was a really good joke.  And he was like   You're the writer  kid.  Anyway    so they had just turned three  and they came and they were doing this dance they had just made up where they were twirling faster and faster until they tumbled to the ground  laughing with all the glee in the world. I crumbled. I kept imagining all the walks I might not take with them  the art projects I might not mess up  the boyfriends I might not scowl at  the aisles I might not walk down. Would they wonder who I was  I thought. Would they yearn for my approval  my love  my voice  A few days later  I woke with an idea of how I might give them that voice. I would reach out to six men from all parts of my life and ask them to be present in the passages of my daughters' lives.  I believe my girls will have plenty of opportunities in their lives   I wrote these men.  They'll have loving families and welcoming homes  but they may not have me. They may not have their dad. Will you help be their dad   And I said to myself I would call this group of men  the Council of Dads.  Now as soon as I had this idea  I decided I wouldn't tell my wife. Okay. She's a very upbeat  naturally excited person. There's this idea in this culture    I don't have to tell you    that you sort of  happy  your way through a problem. We should focus on the positive. My wife  as I said  she grew up outside of Boston. She's got a big smile. She's got a big personality. She's got big hair    although  she told me recently  I can't say she has big hair  because if I say she has big hair  people will think she's from Texas. And it's apparently okay to marry a boy from Georgia  but not to have hair from Texas. And actually  in her defense  if she were here right now  she would point out that  when we got married in Georgia  there were three questions on the marriage certificate license  the third of which was   Are you related   I said   Look  in Georgia at least we want to know. In Arkansas they don't even ask.  What I didn't tell her is  if she said   Yes   you could jump. You don't need the    day waiting period. Because you don't need the get to know you session at that point. So I wasn't going to tell her about this idea  but the next day I couldn't control myself  I told her. And she loved the idea  but she quickly started rejecting my nominees. She was like   Well  I love him  but I would never ask him for advice.  So it turned out that starting a council of dads was a very efficient way to find out what my wife really thought of my friends. So we decided that we needed a set of rules  and we came up with a number. And the first one was no family  only friends. We thought our family would already be there. Second  men only. We were trying to fill the dad space in the girls' lives. And then third  sort of a dad for every side. We kind of went through my personality and tried to get a dad who represented each different thing. So what happened was I wrote a letter to each of these men. And rather than send it  I decided to read it to them in person. Linda  my wife  joked that it was like having six different marriage proposals. I sort of friend married each of these guys. And the first of these guys was Jeff Schumlin. Now Jeff led this trip I took to Europe when I graduated from high school in the early     s. And on that first day we were in this youth hostel in a castle. And I snuck out behind  and there was a moat  a fence and a field of cows. And Jeff came up beside me and said   So  have you ever been cow tipping   I was like   Cow tipping  He was like   Yeah. Cows sleep standing up. So if you approach them from behind  down wind  you can push them over and they go thud in the mud.  So before I had a chance to determine whether this was right or not  we had jumped the moat  we had climbed the fence  we were tiptoeing through the dung and approaching some poor  dozing cow. So a few weeks after my diagnosis  we went up to Vermont  and I decided to put Jeff as the first person in the Council of Dads. And we went to this apple orchard  and I read him this letter.  Will you help be their dad   And I got to the end    he was crying and I was crying    and then he looked at me  and he said   Yes.  I was like   Yes   I kind of had forgotten there was a question at the heart of my letter. And frankly  although I keep getting asked this  it never occurred to me that anybody would turn me down under the circumstances. And then I asked him a question  which I ended up asking to all the dads and ended up really encouraging me to write this story down in a book. And that was   What's the one piece of advice you would give to my girls   And Jeff's advice was   Be a traveller  not a tourist. Get off the bus. Seek out what's different. Approach the cow.   So it's    years from now   I said   and my daughters are about to take their first trip abroad  and I'm not here. What would you tell them   He said   I would approach this journey as a young child might approach a mud puddle. You can bend over and look at your reflection in the mirror and maybe run your finger and make a small ripple  or you can jump in and thrash around and see what it feels like  what it smells like.  And as he talked he had that glint in his eye that I first saw back in Holland    the glint that says   Let's go cow tipping   even though we never did tip the cow  even though no one tips the cow  even though cows don't sleep standing up. He said   I want to see you back here girls  at the end of this experience  covered in mud.  Two weeks after my diagnosis  a biopsy confirmed I had a seven inch osteosarcoma in my left femur. Six hundred Americans a year get an osteosarcoma. Eighty five percent are under   . Only a hundred adults a year get one of these diseases. Twenty years ago  doctors would have cut off my leg and hoped  and there was a    percent survival rate. And then in the     's  they determined that one particular cocktail of chemo could be effective  and within weeks I had started that regimen. And since we are in a medical room  I went through four and a half months of chemo. Actually I had Cisplatin  Doxorubicin and very high dose Methotrexate. And then I had a    hour surgery in which my surgeon  Dr. John Healey at Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital in New York  took out my left femur and replaced it with titanium. And if you did see the Sanjay special  you saw these enormous screws that they screwed into my pelvis. Then he took my fibula from my calf  cut it out and then relocated it to my thigh  where it now lives. And what he actually did was he de vascularized it from my calf and re vascularized it in my thigh and then connected it to the good parts of my knee and my hip. And then he took out a third of my quadriceps muscle. This is a surgery so rare only two human beings have survived it before me. And my reward for surviving it was to go back for four more months of chemo. It was  as we said in my house  a lost year. Because in those opening weeks  we all had nightmares. And one night I had a nightmare that I was walking through my house  sat at my desk and saw photographs of someone else's children sitting on my desk. And I remember a particular one night that  when you told that story of    I don't know where you are Dr. Nuland    of William Sloane Coffin    it made me think of it. Because I was in the hospital after  I think it was my fourth round of chemo when my numbers went to zero  and I had basically no immune system. And they put me in an infectious disease ward at the hospital. And anybody who came to see me had to cover themselves in a mask and cover all of the extraneous parts of their body. And one night I got a call from my mother in law that my daughters  at that time three and a half  were missing me and feeling my absence. And I hung up the phone  and I put my face in my hands  and I screamed this silent scream. And what you said  Dr. Nuland    I don't know where you are    made me think of this today. Because the thought that came to my mind was that the feeling that I had was like a primal scream. And what was so striking    and one of the messages I want to leave you here with today    is the experience. As I became less and less human    and at this moment in my life  I was probably    pounds less than I am right now. Of course  I had no hair and no immune system. They were actually putting blood inside my body. At that moment I was less and less human  I was also  at the same time  maybe the most human I've ever been. And what was so striking about that time was  instead of repulsing people  I was actually proving to be a magnet for people. People were incredibly drawn. When my wife and I had kids  we thought it would be all hands on deck. Instead  it was everybody running the other way. And when I had cancer  we thought it'd be everybody running the other way. Instead  it was all hands on deck. And when people came to me  rather than being incredibly turned off by what they saw    I was like a living ghost    they were incredibly moved to talk about what was going on in their own lives. Cancer  I found  is a passport to intimacy. It is an invitation  maybe even a mandate  to enter the most vital arenas of human life  the most sensitive and the most frightening  the ones that we never want to go to  but when we do go there  we feel incredibly transformed when we do. And this also happened to my girls as they began to see  and  we thought  maybe became an ounce more compassionate. One day  my daughter Tybee  Tybee came to me  and she said   I have so much love for you in my body  daddy  I can't stop giving you hugs and kisses. And when I have no more love left  I just drink milk  because that's where love comes from.  And one night my daughter Eden came to me. And as I lifted my leg out of bed  she reached for my crutches and handed them to me. In fact  if I cling to one memory of this year  it would be walking down a darkened hallway with five spongy fingers grasping the handle underneath my hand. I didn't need the crutch anymore  I was walking on air. And one of the profound things that happened was this act of actually connecting to all these people. And it made me think    and I'll just note for the record    one word that I've only heard once actually was when we were all doing Tony Robbins yoga yesterday    the one word that has not been mentioned in this seminar actually is the word  friend.  And yet from everything we've been talking about    compliance  or addiction  or weight loss    we now know that community is important  and yet it's one thing we don't actually bring in. And there was something incredibly profound about sitting down with my closest friends and telling them what they meant to me. And one of the things that I learned is that over time  particularly men  who used to be non communicative  are becoming more and more communicative. And that particularly happened    there was one in my life    is this Council of Dads that Linda said  what we were talking about  it's like what the moms talk about at school drop off. And no one captures this modern manhood to me more than David Black. Now David is my literary agent. He's about five foot three and a half on a good day  standing fully upright in cowboy boots. And on kind of the manly male front  he answers the phone    I can say this I guess because you've done it here    he answers the phone   Yo  motherfucker.  He gives boring speeches about obscure bottles of wine  and on his   th birthday he bought a convertible sports car    although  like a lot of men  he's impatient  he bought it on his   th. But like a lot of modern men  he hugs  he bakes  he leaves work early to coach Little League. Someone asked me if he cried when I asked him to be in the council of dads. I was like   David cries when you invite him to take a walk.  But he's a literary agent  which means he's a broker of dreams in a world where most dreams don't come true. And this is what we wanted him to capture    what it means to have setbacks and then aspirations. And I said   What's the most valuable thing you can give to a dreamer   And he said   A belief in themselves.   But when I came to see you   I said   I didn't believe in myself. I was at a wall.  He said   I don't see the wall   and I'm telling you the same  Don't see the wall. You may encounter one from time to time  but you've got to find a way to get over it  around it  or through it. But whatever you do  don't succumb to it. Don't give in to the wall. My home is not far from the Brooklyn Bridge  and during the year and a half I was on crutches  it became a sort of symbol to me. So one day near the end of my journey  I said   Come on girls  let's take a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge.  We set out on crutches. I was on crutches  my wife was next to me  my girls were doing these rockstar poses up ahead. And because walking was one of the first things I lost  I spent most of that year thinking about this most elemental of human acts. Walking upright  we are told  is the threshold of what made us human. And yet  for the four million years humans have been walking upright  the act is essentially unchanged. As my physical therapist likes to say   Every step is a tragedy waiting to happen.  You nearly fall with one leg  then you catch yourself with the other. And the biggest consequence of walking on crutches    as I did for a year and a half    is that you walk slower. You hurry  you get where you're going  but you get there alone. You go slow  you get where you're going  but you get there with this community you built along the way. At the risk of admission  I was never nicer than the year I was on crutches.     years ago  a new type of pedestrian appeared in Paris. He was called a  flaneur   one who wanders the arcades. And it was the custom of those flaneurs to show they were men of leisure by taking turtles for walks and letting the reptile set the pace. And I just love this ode to slow moving. And it's become my own motto for my girls. Take a walk with a turtle. Behold the world in pause. And this idea of pausing may be the single biggest lesson I took from my journey. There's a quote from Moses on the side of the Liberty Bell  and it comes from a passage in the book of Leviticus  that every seven years you should let the land lay fallow. And every seven sets of seven years  the land gets an extra year of rest during which time all families are reunited and people surrounded with the ones they love. That   th year is called the jubilee year  and it's the origin of that term. And though I'm shy of     it captures my own experience. My lost year was my jubilee year. By laying fallow  I planted the seeds for a healthier future and was reunited with the ones I love. Come the one year anniversary of my journey  I went to see my surgeon  Dr. John Healey    and by the way  Healey  great name for a doctor. He's the president of the International Society of Limb Salvage  which is the least euphemistic term I've ever heard. And I said   Dr. Healey  if my daughters come to you one day and say  'What should I learn from my daddy's story ' what would you tell them   He said   I would tell them what I know  and that is everybody dies  but not everybody lives. I want you to live.  I wrote a letter to my girls that appears at the end of my book   The Council of Dads   and I listed these lessons  a few of which you've heard here today  Approach the cow  pack your flipflops  don't see the wall  live the questions  harvest miracles. As I looked at this list    to me it was sort of like a psalm book of living    I realized  we may have done it for our girls  but it really changed us. And that is  the secret of the Council of Dads  is that my wife and I did this in an attempt to help our daughters  but it really changed us. So I stand here today as you see now  walking without crutches or a cane. And last week I had my    month scans. And as you all know  anybody with cancer has to get follow up scans. In my case it's quarterly. And all the collective minds in this room  I dare say  can never find a solution for scan xiety. As I was going there  I was wondering  what would I say depending on what happened here. I got good news that day  and I stand here today cancer free  walking without aid and hobbling forward. And I just want to mention briefly in passing    I'm past my time limit    but I just want to briefly mention in passing that one of the nice things that can come out of a conference like this is  at a similar meeting  back in the spring  Anne Wojcicki heard about our story and very quickly    in a span of three weeks    put the full resources of   andMe  and we announced an initiative in July to get to decode the genome of anybody  a living person with a heart tissue  bone sarcoma. And she told me last night  in the three months since we've done it  we've gotten     people who've contributed to this program. And the epidemiologists here will tell you  that's half the number of people who get the disease in one year in the United States. So if you go to   andMe  or if you go to councilofdads.com  you can click on a link. And we encourage anybody to join this effort. But I'll just close what I've been talking about by leaving you with this message  May you find an excuse to reach out to some long lost pal  or to that college roommate  or to some person you may have turned away from. May you find a mud puddle to jump in someplace  or find a way to get over  around  or through any wall that stands between you and one of your dreams. And every now and then  find a friend  find a turtle  and take a long  slow walk. Thank you very much. I am passionate about the American landscape and how the physical form of the land  from the great Central Valley of California to the bedrock of Manhattan  has really shaped our history and our character. But one thing is clear. In the last     years alone  our country    and this is a sprawl map of America    our country has systematically flattened and homogenized the landscape to the point where we've forgotten our relationship with the plants and animals that live alongside us and the dirt beneath our feet. And so  how I see my work contributing is sort of trying to literally re imagine these connections and physically rebuild them. This graph represents what we're dealing with now in the built environment. And it's really a conflux of urban population rising  biodiversity plummeting and also  of course  sea levels rising and climate changing. So when I also think about design  I think about trying to rework and re engage the lines on this graph in a more productive way. And you can see from the arrow here indicating  you are here   I'm trying to sort of blend and meld these two very divergent fields of urbanism and ecology  and sort of bring them together in an exciting new way. So the era of big infrastructure is over. I mean  these sort of top down  mono functional  capital intensive solutions are really not going to cut it. We need new tools and new approaches. Similarly  the idea of architecture as this sort of object in the field  devoid of context  is really not the    excuse me  it's fairly blatant    is really not the approach that we need to take. So we need new stories  new heroes and new tools. So now I want to introduce you to my new hero in the global climate change war  and that is the eastern oyster. So  albeit a very small creature and very modest  this creature is incredible  because it can agglomerate into these mega reef structures. It can grow  you can grow it  and    did I mention     it's quite tasty. So the oyster was the basis for a manifesto like urban design project that I did about the New York Harbor called  oyster tecture.  And the core idea of oyster tecture is to harness the biological power of mussels  eelgrass and oysters    species that live in the harbor    and  at the same time  harness the power of people who live in the community towards making change now. Here's a map of my city  New York City  showing inundation in red. And what's circled is the site that I'm going to talk about  the Gowanus Canal and Governors Island. If you look here at this map  showing everything in blue is out in the water  and everything in yellow is upland. But you can see  even just intuit  from this map  that the harbor has dredged and flattened  and went from a rich  three dimensional mosaic to flat muck in really a matter of years. Another set of views of actually the Gowanus Canal itself. Now the Gowanus is particularly smelly    I will admit it. There are problems of sewage overflow and contamination  but I would also argue that almost every city has this exact condition  and it's a condition that we're all facing. And here's a map of that condition  showing the contaminants in yellow and green  exacerbated by this new flow of storm surge and sea level rise. So we really had a lot to deal with. When we started this project  one of the core ideas was to look back in history and try to understand what was there. And you can see from this map  there's this incredible geographical signature of a series of islands that were out in the harbor and a matrix of salt marshes and beaches that served as natural wave attenuation for the upland settlement. We also learned at this time that you could eat an oyster about the size of a dinner plate in the Gowanus Canal itself. So our concept is really this back to the future concept  harnessing the intelligence of that land settlement pattern. And the idea has two core stages. One is to develop a new artificial ecology  a reef out in the harbor  that would then protect new settlement patterns inland and the Gowanus. Because if you have cleaner water and slower water  you can imagine a new way of living with that water. So the project really addresses these three core issues in a new and exciting way  I think. Here we are  back to our hero  the oyster. And again  it's this incredibly exciting animal. It accepts algae and detritus in one end  and through this beautiful  glamorous set of stomach organs  out the other end comes cleaner water. And one oyster can filter up to    gallons of water a day. Oyster reefs also covered about a quarter of our harbor and were capable of filtering water in the harbor in a matter of days. They were key in our culture and our economy. Basically  New York was built on the backs of oystermen  and our streets were literally built over oyster shells. This image is an image of an oyster cart  which is now as ubiquitous as the hotdog cart is today. So again  we got the short end of the deal there. Finally  oysters can attenuate and agglomerate onto each other and form these amazing natural reef structures. They really become nature's wave attenuators. And they become the bedrock of any harbor ecosystem. Many  many species depend on them. So we were inspired by the oyster  but I was also inspired by the life cycle of the oyster. It can move from a fertilized egg to a spat  which is when they're floating through the water  and when they're ready to attach onto another oyster  to an adult male oyster or female oyster  in a number of weeks. We reinterpreted this life cycle on the scale of our sight and took the Gowanus as a giant oyster nursery where oysters would be grown up in the Gowanus  then paraded down in their spat stage and seeded out on the Bayridge Reef. And so the core idea here was to hit the reset button and regenerate an ecology over time that was regenerative and cleaning and productive. How does the reef work  Well  it's very  very simple. A core concept here is that climate change isn't something that    the answers won't land down from the Moon. And with a     billion price tag  we should simply start and get to work with what we have now and what's in front of us. So this image is simply showing    it's a field of marine piles interconnected with this woven fuzzy rope. What is fuzzy rope  you ask  It's just that  it's this very inexpensive thing  available practically at your hardware store  and it's very cheap. So we imagine that we would actually potentially even host a bake sale to start our new project. So in the studio  rather than drawing  we began to learn how to knit. The concept was to really knit this rope together and develop this new soft infrastructure for the oysters to grow on. You can see in the diagram how it grows over time from an infrastructural space into a new public urban space. And that grows over time dynamically with the threat of climate change. It also creates this incredibly interesting  I think  new amphibious public space  where you can imagine working  you can imagine recreating in a new way. In the end  what we realized we were making was a new blue green watery park for the next watery century    an amphibious park  if you will. So get your Tevas on. So you can imagine scuba diving here. This is an image of high school students  scuba divers that we worked with on our team. So you can imagine a sort of new manner of living with a new relationship with the water  and also a hybridizing of recreational and science programs in terms of monitoring. Another new vocabulary word for the brave new world  this is the word  flupsy     it's short for  floating upwelling system.  And this glorious  readily available device is basically a floating raft with an oyster nursery below. So the water is churned through this raft. You can see the eight chambers on the side host little baby oysters and essentially force feed them. So rather than having    oysters  you have        oysters. And then those spat are then seeded. Here's the Gowanus future with the oyster rafts on the shorelines    the flupsification of the Gowanus. New word. And also showing oyster gardening for the community along its edges. And finally  how much fun it would be to watch the flupsy parade and cheer on the oyster spats as they go down to the reef. I get asked two questions about this project. One is  why isn't it happening now  And the second one is  when can we eat the oysters  And the answer is  not yet  they're working. But we imagine  with our calculations  that by       you might be able to sink your teeth into a Gowanus oyster. To conclude  this is just one cross section of one piece of city  but my dream is  my hope is  that when you all go back to your own cities that we can start to work together and collaborate on remaking and reforming a new urban landscape towards a more sustainable  a more livable and a more delicious future. Thank you. I'm going to have a pretty simple idea that I'm just going to tell you over and over until I get you to believe it  and that is all of us are makers. I really believe that. All of us are makers. We're born makers. We have this ability to make things  to grasp things with our hands. We use words like  grasp  metaphorically to also think about understanding things. We don't just live  but we make. We create things. Well I'm going to show you a group of makers from Maker Faire and various places. It doesn't come out particularly well  but that's a particularly tall bicycle. It's a scraper bike  it's called    from Oakland. And this is a particularly small scooter for a gentleman of this size. But he's trying to power it  or motorize it  with a drill. And the question he had is   Can I do it  Can it be done   Apparently it can. So makers are enthusiasts  they're amateurs  they're people who love doing what they do. They don't always even know why they're doing it. We have begun organizing makers at our Maker Faire. There was one held in Detroit here last summer  and it will be held again next summer  at the Henry Ford. But we hold them in San Francisco       and in New York. And it's a fabulous event to just meet and talk to these people who make things and are there to just show them to you and talk about them and have a great conversation. Dale Dougherty  These are electric muffins. Guy  Where did you guys get those  Muffin  Will you glide with us   Guy  No.  DD  I know Ford has new electric vehicles coming out. We got there first. Lady  Will you glide with us  DD  This is something I call  swinging in the rain.  And you can barely see it  but it's    a controller at top cycles the water to fall just before and after you pass through the bottom of the arc. So imagine a kid   Am I going to get wet  Am I going to get wet  No  I didn't get wet. Am I going to get wet  Am I going to get wet   That's the experience of a clever ride. And of course  we have fashion. People are remaking things into fashion. I don't know if this is called a basket bra  but it ought to be something like that. We have art students getting together  taking old radiator parts and doing an iron pour to make something new out of it. They did that in the summer  and it was very warm. Now this one takes a little bit of explaining. You know what those are  right  Billy Bob  or Billy Bass  or something like that. Now the background is    the guy who did this is a physicist. And here he'll explain a little bit about what it does. and this is the Sashimi Tabernacle Choir. Choir    When you hold me in your arms   DD  This is all computer controlled in an old Volvo. Choir    I'm hooked on a feelin'     I'm high on believin'     That you're in love with me   DD  So Richard came up from Houston last year to visit us in Detroit here and show the wonderful Sashimi Tabernacle Choir. So  are you a maker  How many people here would say you're a maker  if you raise your hand  That's a pretty good    but there's some of you out there that won't admit that you're makers. And again  think about it. You're makers of food  you're makers of shelter  you're makers of lots of different things  and partly what interests me today is you're makers of your own world  and particularly the role that technology has in your life. You're really a driver or a passenger    to use a Volkswagen phrase. Makers are in control. That's what fascinates them. That's why they do what they do. They want to figure out how things work  they want to get access to it  and they want to control it. They want to use it to their own purpose. Makers today  to some degree  are out on the edge. They're not mainstream. They're a little bit radical. They're a bit subversive in what they do. But at one time  it was fairly commonplace to think of yourself as a maker. It was not something you'd even remark upon. And I found this old video. And I'll tell you more about it  but just ... we are makers. With our strengths and our minds and spirit  we gather  we form  and we fashion. Makers and shapers and put it togetherers. DD  So it goes on to show you people making things out of wood  a grandfather making a ship in a bottle  a woman making a pie    somewhat standard fare of the day. But it was a sense of pride that we made things  that the world around us was made by us. It didn't just exist. We made it  and we were connected to it that way. And I think that's tremendously important. Now I'm going to tell you one funny thing about this. This particular reel    it's an industrial video    but it was shown in drive in theaters in         in the Detroit area  in fact    and it preceded Alfred Hitchcock's  Psycho.  So I like to think there was something going on there of the new generation of makers coming out of this  plus  Psycho.  This is Andrew Archer. I met Andrew at one of our community meetings putting together Maker Faire. Andrew had moved to Detroit from Duluth  Minnesota. And I talked to his mom  and I ended up doing a story on him for a magazine called Kidrobot. He's just a kid that grew up playing with tools instead of toys. He liked to take things apart. His mother gave him a part of the garage  and he collected things from yard sales  and he made stuff. And then he didn't particularly like school that much  but he got involved in robotics competitions  and he realized he had a talent  and  more importantly  he had a real passion for it. And he began building robots. And when I sat down next to him  he was telling me about a company he formed  and he was building some robots for automobile factories to move things around on the factory floor. And that's why he moved to Michigan. But he also moved here to meet other people doing what he's doing. And this kind of gets to this important idea today. This is Jeff and Bilal and several others here in a hackerspace. And there's about three hackerspaces or more in Detroit. And there's probably even some new ones since I've been here last. But these are like clubs    they're sharing tools  sharing space  sharing expertise in what to make. And so it's a very interesting phenomenon that's going across the world. But essentially these are people that are playing with technology. Let me say that again  playing. They don't necessarily know what they're doing or why they're doing it. They're playing to discover what the technology can do  and probably to discover what they can do themselves  what their own capabilities are. Now the other thing that I think is taking off  another reason making is taking off today  is there's some great new tools out there. And you can't see this very well on the screen  but Arduino    Arduino is an open source hardware platform. It's a micro controller. If you don't know what those are  they're just the  brains.  So they're the brains of maker projects  and here's an example of one. And I don't know if you can see it that well  but that's a mailbox    so an ordinary mailbox and an Arduino. So you figure out how to program this  and you put this in your mailbox. And when someone opens your mailbox  you get a notification  an alert message goes to your iPhone. Now that could be a dog door  it could be someone going somewhere where they shouldn't  like a little brother into a little sister's room. There's all kinds of different things that you can imagine for that. Now here's something    a  D printer. That's another tool that's really taken off    really  really interesting. This is Makerbot. And there are industrial versions of this    about        dollars. These guys came up with a kit version for     dollars  and that means that hobbyists and ordinary folks can get a hold of this and begin playing with  D printers. Now they don't know what they want to do with it  but they're going to figure it out. They will only figure it out by getting their hands on it and playing with it. One of the coolest things is  Makerbot sent out an upgrade  some new brackets for the box. Well you printed out the brackets and then replaced the old brackets with the new ones. Isn't that cool  So makers harvest technology from all the places around us. This is a radar speed detector that was developed from a Hot Wheels toy. And they do interesting things. They're really creating new areas and exploring areas that you might only think    the military is doing drones    well  there is a whole community of people building autonomous airplanes  or vehicles    something that you could program to fly on its own  without a stick or anything  to figure out what path it's going. Fascinating work they're doing. We just had an issue on space exploration  DIY space exploration. This is probably the best time in the history of mankind to love space. You could build your own satellite and get it into space for like       dollars. Think how much money and how many years it took NASA to get satellites into space. In fact  these guys actually work for NASA  and they're trying to pioneer using off the shelf components  cheap things that aren't specialized that they can combine and send up into space. Makers are a source of innovation  and I think it relates back to something like the birth of the personal computer industry. This is Steve Wozniak. Where does he learn about computers  It's the Homebrew Computer Club    just like a hackerspace. And he says   I could go there all day long and talk to people and share ideas for free.  Well he did a little bit better than free. But it's important to understand that a lot of the origins of our industries    even like Henry Ford    come from this idea of playing and figuring things out in groups. Well  if I haven't convinced you that you're a maker  I hope I could convince you that our next generation should be makers  that kids are particularly interested in this  in this ability to control the physical world and be able to use things like micro controllers and build robots. And we've got to get this into schools  or into communities in many  many ways    the ability to tinker  to shape and reshape the world around us. There's a great opportunity today    and that's what I really care about the most. An the answer to the question  what will America make  It's more makers. Thank you very much. I'm going to make an argument today that may seem a little bit crazy  social media and the end of gender. Let me connect the dots. I'm going to argue today that the social media applications that we all know and love  or love to hate  are actually going to help free us from some of the absurd assumptions that we have as a society about gender. I think that social media is actually going to help us dismantle some of the silly and demeaning stereotypes that we see in media and advertising about gender. If you hadn't noticed  our media climate generally provides a very distorted mirror of our lives and of our gender  and I think that's going to change. Now most media companies    television  radio  publishing  games  you name it    they use very rigid segmentation methods in order to understand their audiences. It's old school demographics. They come up with these very restrictive labels to define us. Now the crazy thing is that media companies believe that if you fall within a certain demographic category then you are predictable in certain ways    you have certain taste  that you like certain things. And so the bizarre result of this is that most of our popular culture is actually based on these presumptions about our demographics. Age demographics  the    to    demo has had a huge impact on all mass media programming in this country since the     s  when the baby boomers were still young. Now they've aged out of that demographic  but it's still the case that powerful ratings companies like Nielson don't even take into account viewers of television shows over age   . In our media environment  it's as if they don't even exist. Now  if you watch  Mad Men   like I do    it's a popular TV show in the States    Dr. Faye Miller does something called psychographics  which first came about in the     s  where you create these complex psychological profiles of consumers. But psychographics really haven't had a huge impact on the media business. It's really just been basic demographics. So I'm at the Norman Lear Center at USC  and we've done a lot of research over the last seven  eight years on demographics and how they affect media and entertainment in this country and abroad. And in the last three years  we've been looking specifically at social media to see what has changed  and we've discovered some very interesting things. All the people who participate in social media networks belong to the same old demographic categories that media companies and advertisers have used in order to understand them. But those categories mean even less now than they did before  because with online networking tools  it's much easier for us to escape some of our demographic boxes. We're able to connect with people quite freely and to redefine ourselves online. And we can lie about our age online  too  pretty easily. We can also connect with people based on our very specific interests. We don't need a media company to help do this for us. So the traditional media companies  of course  are paying very close attention to these online communities. They know this is the mass audience of the future  they need to figure it out. But they're having a hard time doing it because they're still trying to use demographics in order to understand them  because that's how ad rates are still determined. When they're monitoring your clickstream    and you know they are    they have a really hard time figuring out your age  your gender and your income. They can make some educated guesses. But they get a lot more information about what you do online  what you like  what interests you. That's easier for them to find out than who you are. And even though that's still sort of creepy  there is an upside to having your taste monitored. Suddenly our taste is being respected in a way that it hasn't been before. It had been presumed before. So when you look online at the way people aggregate  they don't aggregate around age  gender and income. They aggregate around the things they love  the things that they like  and if you think about it  shared interests and values are a far more powerful aggregator of human beings than demographic categories. I'd much rather know whether you like  Buffy the Vampire Slayer  rather than how old you are. That would tell me something more substantial about you. Now there's something else that we've discovered about social media that's actually quite surprising. It turns out that women are really driving the social media revolution. If you look at the statistics    these are worldwide statistics    in every single age category  women actually outnumber men in their use of social networking technologies. And then if you look at the amount of time that they spend on these sites  they truly dominate the social media space  which is a space that's having a huge impact on old media. The question is  what sort of impact is this going to have on our culture  and what's it going to mean for women  If the case is that social media is dominating old media and women are dominating social media  then does that mean that women are going to take over global media  Are we suddenly going to see a lot more female characters in cartoons and in games and on TV shows  Will the next big budget blockbuster movies actually be chick flicks  Could this be possible  that suddenly our media landscape will become a feminist landscape  Well  I actually don't think that's going to be the case. I think that media companies are going to hire a lot more women  because they realize this is important for their business  and I think that women are also going to continue to dominate the social media sphere. But I think women are actually going to be    ironically enough    responsible for driving a stake through the heart of cheesy genre categories like the  chick flick  and all these other genre categories that presume that certain demographic groups like certain things    that Hispanics like certain things  that young people like certain things. This is far too simplistic. The future entertainment media that we're going to see is going to be very data driven  and it's going to be based on the information that we ascertain from taste communities online  where women are really driving the action. So you may be asking  well why is it important that I know what entertains people  Why should I know this  Of course  old media companies and advertisers need to know this. But my argument is that  if you want to understand the global village  it's probably a good idea that you figure out what they're passionate about  what amuses them  what they choose to do in their free time. This is a very important thing to know about people. I've spent most of my professional life researching media and entertainment and its impact on people's lives. And I do it not just because it's fun    though actually  it is really fun    but also because our research has shown over and over again that entertainment and play have a huge impact on people's lives    for instance  on their political beliefs and on their health. And so  if you have any interest in understanding the world  looking at how people amuse themselves is a really good way to start. So imagine a media atmosphere that isn't dominated by lame stereotypes about gender and other demographic characteristics. Can you even imagine what that looks like  I can't wait to find out what it looks like. Thank you so much. Running    it's basically just right  left  right  left    yeah  I mean  we've been doing it for two million years  so it's kind of arrogant to assume that I've got something to say that hasn't been said and performed better a long time ago. But the cool thing about running  as I've discovered  is that something bizarre happens in this activity all the time. Case in point  A couple months ago  if you saw the New York City Marathon  I guarantee you  you saw something that no one has ever seen before. An Ethiopian woman named Derartu Tulu turns up at the starting line. She's    years old  she hasn't won a marathon of any kind in eight years  and a few months previously she almost died in childbirth. Derartu Tulu was ready to hang it up and retire from the sport  but she decided she'd go for broke and try for one last big payday in the marquee event  the New York City Marathon. Except    bad news for Derartu Tulu    some other people had the same idea  including the Olympic gold medalist and Paula Radcliffe  who is a monster  the fastest woman marathoner in history by far. Only    minutes off the men's world record  Paula Radcliffe is essentially unbeatable. That's her competition. The gun goes off  and she's not even an underdog. She's under the underdogs. But the under underdog hangs tough  and    miles into a    mile race  there is Derartu Tulu up there with the lead pack. Now this is when something really bizarre happens. Paula Radcliffe  the one person who is sure to snatch the big paycheck out of Derartu Tulu's under underdog hands  suddenly grabs her leg and starts to fall back. So we all know what to do in this situation  right  You give her a quick crack in the teeth with your elbow and blaze for the finish line. Derartu Tulu ruins the script. Instead of taking off  she falls back  and she grabs Paula Radcliffe  says   Come on. Come with us. You can do it.  So Paula Radcliffe  unfortunately  does it. She catches up with the lead pack and is pushing toward the finish line. But then she falls back again. And the second time Derartu Tulu grabs her and tries to pull her. And Paula Radcliffe at that point says   I'm done. Go.  So that's a fantastic story  and we all know how it ends. She loses the check  but she goes home with something bigger and more important. Except Derartu Tulu ruins the script again    instead of losing  she blazes past the lead pack and wins  wins the New York City Marathon  goes home with a big fat check. It's a heartwarming story  but if you drill a little bit deeper  you've got to sort of wonder about what exactly was going on there. When you have two outliers in one organism  it's not a coincidence. When you have someone who is more competitive and more compassionate than anybody else in the race  again  it's not a coincidence. You show me a creature with webbed feet and gills  somehow water's involved. Someone with that kind of heart  there's some kind of connection there. And the answer to it  I think  can be found down in the Copper Canyons of Mexico  where there's a tribe  a reclusive tribe  called the Tarahumara Indians. Now the Tarahumara are remarkable for three things. Number one is  they have been living essentially unchanged for the past     years. When the conquistadors arrived in North America you had two choices  you either fight back and engage or you could take off. The Mayans and Aztecs engaged  which is why there are very few Mayans and Aztecs. The Tarahumara had a different strategy. They took off and hid in this labyrinthine  networking  spiderwebbing system of canyons called the Copper Canyons  and there they remained since the     s    essentially the same way they've always been. The second thing remarkable about the Tarahumara is  deep into old age       to    years old    these guys aren't running marathons  they're running mega marathons. They're not doing    miles  they're doing          miles at a time  and apparently without injury  without problems. The last thing that's remarkable about the Tarahumara is that all the things that we're going to be talking about today  all the things that we're trying to come up with using all of our technology and brain power to solve    things like heart disease and cholesterol and cancer and crime and warfare and violence and clinical depression    all this stuff  the Tarahumara don't know what you're talking about. They are free from all of these modern ailments. So what's the connection  Again  we're talking about outliers    there's got to be some kind of cause and effect there. Well  there are teams of scientists at Harvard and the University of Utah that are bending their brains to try to figure out what the Tarahumara have known forever. They're trying to solve those same kinds of mysteries. And once again  a mystery wrapped inside of a mystery    perhaps the key to Derartu Tulu and the Tarahumara is wrapped in three other mysteries  which go like this  three things    if you have the answer  come up and take the microphone  because nobody else knows the answer. And if you know it  then you are smarter than anybody else on planet Earth. Mystery number one is this  Two million years ago the human brain exploded in size. Australopithecus had a tiny little pea brain. Suddenly humans show up    Homo erectus    big  old melon head. To have a brain of that size  you need to have a source of condensed caloric energy. In other words  early humans are eating dead animals    no argument  that's a fact. The only problem is  the first edged weapons only appeared about         years ago. So  somehow  for nearly two million years  we are killing animals without any weapons. Now we're not using our strength because we are the biggest sissies in the jungle. Every other animal is stronger than we are    they have fangs  they have claws  they have nimbleness  they have speed. We think Usain Bolt is fast. Usain Bolt can get his ass kicked by a squirrel. We're not fast. That would be an Olympic event  turn a squirrel loose    whoever catches the squirrel  you get a gold medal. So no weapons  no speed  no strength  no fangs  no claws    how were we killing these animals  Mystery number one. Mystery number two  Women have been in the Olympics for quite some time now  but one thing that's remarkable about all women sprinters    they all suck  they're terrible. There's not a fast woman on the planet and there never has been. The fastest woman to ever run a mile did it in     . I could throw a rock and hit a high school boy who can run faster than     . For some reason you guys are just really slow. But you get to the marathon we were just talking about    you guys have only been allowed to run the marathon for    years. Because  prior to the     s  medical science said that if a woman tried to run    miles    does anyone know what would happen if you tried to run    miles  why you were banned from the marathon before the     s  Yes. You would have torn reproductive organs. The uterus would fall out  literally fall out of the body. Now I've been to a lot of marathons  and I've yet to see any ... So it's only been    years that women have been allowed to run the marathon. In that very short learning curve  you guys have gone from broken organs up to the fact that you're only    minutes off the male world record. Then you go beyond    miles  into the distance that medical science also told us would be fatal to humans    remember Pheidippides died when he ran    miles    you get to    and     miles  and suddenly it's a different game. You can take a runner like Ann Trason  or Nikki Kimball  or Jenn Shelton  you put them in a race of    or     miles against anybody in the world and it's a coin toss who's going to win. I'll give you an example. A couple years ago  Emily Baer signed up for a race called the Hardrock      which tells you all you need to know about the race. They give you    hours to finish this race. Well Emily Baer        runners    she finishes in eighth place  in the top     even though she stopped at all the aid stations to breastfeed her baby during the race    and yet  beat     other people. So why is it that women get stronger as distances get longer  The third mystery is this  At the University of Utah  they started tracking finishing times for people running the marathon. And what they found is that  if you start running the marathon at age     you will get progressively faster  year by year  until you reach your peak at age   . And then after that  you succumb to the rigors of time. And you'll get slower and slower  until eventually you're back to running the same speed you were at age   . So about seven years  eight years to reach your peak  and then gradually you fall off your peak  until you go back to the starting point. You would think it might take eight years to go back to the same speed  maybe    years    no  it's    years.    year old men and women are running as fast as they were at age   . Now I defy you to come up with any other physical activity    and please don't say golf    something that actually is hard    where geriatrics are performing as well as they did as teenagers. So you have these three mysteries. Is there one piece in the puzzle which might wrap all these things up  You've got to be really careful any time someone looks back in prehistory and tries to give you some sort of global answer  because  it being prehistory  you can say whatever the hell you want and get away with it. But I'll submit this to you  If you put one piece in the middle of this jigsaw puzzle  suddenly it all starts to form a coherent picture. If you wonder  why it is the Tarahumara don't fight and don't die of heart disease  why a poor Ethiopian woman named Derartu Tulu can be the most compassionate and yet the most competitive  and why we somehow were able to find food without weapons  perhaps it's because humans  as much as we like to think of ourselves as masters of the universe  actually evolved as nothing more than a pack of hunting dogs. Maybe we evolved as a hunting pack animal. Because the one advantage we have in the wilderness    again  it's not our fangs and our claws and our speed    the only thing we do really  really well is sweat. We're really good at being sweaty and smelly. Better than any other mammal on Earth  we can sweat really well. But the advantage of that little bit of social discomfort is the fact that  when it comes to running under hot heat for long distances  we're superb  we're the best on the planet. You take a horse on a hot day  and after about five or six miles  that horse has a choice. It's either going to breathe or it's going to cool off  but it ain't doing both    we can. So what if we evolved as hunting pack animals  What if the only natural advantage we had in the world was the fact that we could get together as a group  go out there on that African Savannah  pick out an antelope and go out as a pack and run that thing to death  That's all we could do. We could run really far on a hot day. Well if that's true  a couple other things had to be true as well. The key to being part of a hunting pack is the word  pack.  If you go out by yourself  and you try to chase an antelope  I guarantee you there's going to be two cadavers out there in the Savannah. You need a pack to pull together. You need to have those         year olds who have been doing this for a long time to understand which antelope you're actually trying to catch. The herd explodes and it gathers back again. Those expert trackers have got to be part of the pack. They can't be    miles behind. You need to have the women and the adolescents there because the two times in your life you most benefit from animal protein is when you are a nursing mother and a developing adolescent. It makes no sense to have the antelope over there dead and the people who want to eat it    miles away. They need to be part of the pack. You need to have those    year old studs at the peak of their powers ready to drop the kill  and you need to have those teenagers there who are learning the whole thing all involved. The pack stays together. Another thing that has to be true about this pack  this pack cannot be really materialistic. You can't be hauling all your crap around  trying to chase the antelope. You can't be a pissed off pack. You can't be bearing grudges  like   I'm not chasing that guy's antelope. He pissed me off. Let him go chase his own antelope.  The pack has got to be able to swallow its ego  be cooperative and pull together. What you end up with  in other words  is a culture remarkably similar to the Tarahumara    a tribe that has remained unchanged since the Stone Age. It's a really compelling argument that maybe the Tarahumara are doing exactly what all of us had done for two million years  that it's us in modern times who have sort of gone off the path. You know  we look at running as this kind of alien  foreign thing  this punishment you've got to do because you ate pizza the night before. But maybe it's something different. Maybe we're the ones who have taken this natural advantage we had and we spoiled it. How do we spoil it  Well how do we spoil anything  We try to cash in on it. We try to can it and package it and make it  better  and sell it to people. And what happened was we started creating these fancy cushioned things  which can make running  better   called running shoes. The reason I get personally pissed off about running shoes is because I bought a million of them and I kept getting hurt. And I think that  if anybody in here runs    and I just had a conversation with Carol  we talked for two minutes backstage  and she's talking about plantar fasciitis. You talk to a runner  I guarantee  within    seconds  the conversation turns to injury. So if humans evolved as runners  if that's our one natural advantage  why are we so bad at it  Why do we keep getting hurt  Curious thing about running and running injuries is that the running injury is new to our time. If you read folklore and mythology  any kind of myths  any kind of tall tales  running is always associated with freedom and vitality and youthfulness and eternal vigor. It's only in our lifetime that running has become associated with fear and pain. Geronimo used to say that   My only friends are my legs. I only trust my legs.  That's because an Apache triathlon used to be you'd run    miles across the desert  engage in hand to hand combat  steal a bunch of horses and slap leather for home. Geronimo was never saying   Ah  you know something  my achilles    I'm tapering. I got to take this week off   or  I need to cross train. I didn't do yoga. I'm not ready.  Humans ran and ran all the time. We are here today. We have our digital technology. All of our science comes from the fact that our ancestors were able to do something extraordinary every day  which was just rely on their naked feet and legs to run long distances. So how do we get back to that again  Well  I would submit to you the first thing is get rid of all packaging  all the sales  all the marketing. Get rid of all the stinking running shoes. Stop focusing on urban marathons  which  if you do four hours  you suck. If you do          you're awesome  because you qualified for another race. We need to get back to that sense of playfulness and joyfulness and  I would say  nakedness  that has made the Tarahumara one of the healthiest and serene cultures in our time. So what's the benefit  So what  So you burn off the Haagen Dazs from the night before  But maybe there's another benefit there as well. Without getting a little too extreme about this  imagine a world where everybody could go out their door and engage in the kind of exercise that's going to make them more relaxed  more serene  more healthy  burn off stress    where you don't come back into your office a raging maniac anymore  where you don't go back home with a lot of stress on top of you again. Maybe there's something between what we are today and what the Tarahumara have always been. I don't say let's go back to the Copper Canyons and live on corn and maize  which is the Tarahumara's preferred diet  but maybe there's somewhere in between. And if we find that thing  maybe there is a big fat Nobel Prize out there. Because if somebody could find a way to restore that natural ability that we all enjoyed for most of our existence  up until the     s or so  the benefits  social and physical and political and mental  could be astounding. So what I've been seeing today is there is a growing subculture of barefoot runners  people who got rid of their shoes. And what they have found uniformly is you get rid of the shoes  you get rid of the stress  you get rid of the injuries and the ailments. And what you find is something the Tarahumara have known for a very long time  that this can be a whole lot of fun. I've experienced it personally myself. I was injured all my life  and then in my early   s I got rid of my shoes and my running ailments have gone away too. So hopefully it's something we can all benefit from. And I appreciate you guys listening to this story. Thanks very much.  What I Will  I will not dance to your war drum. I will not lend my soul nor my bones to your war drum. I will not dance to that beating. I know that beat. It is lifeless. I know intimately that skin you are hitting. It was alive once  hunted  stolen  stretched. I will not dance to your drummed up war. I will not pop  spin  break for you. I will not hate for you or even hate you. I will not kill for you. Especially I will not die for you. I will not mourn the dead with murder nor suicide. I will not side with you or dance to bombs because everyone is dancing. Everyone can be wrong. Life is a right  not collateral or casual. I will not forget where I come from. I will craft my own drum. Gather my beloved near  and our chanting will be dancing. Our humming will be drumming. I will not be played. I will not lend my name nor my rhythm to your beat. I will dance and resist and dance and persist and dance. This heartbeat is louder than death. Your war drum ain't louder than this breath. Haaa. What's up TED people  Let me hear you make some noise. A bunch of pacifists. Confused  aspiring pacifists. I understand. I've been wrong a lot lately. Like a lot. So I couldn't figure out what to read today. I mean  I've been saying I've been prepping. What that means is prepping my outfit  prepping options  trying to figure out what I'm coming behind and going in front of. Poetry does that. It preps you. It aims you. So I am going to read a poem that was chosen just now. But I'm going to need you to just sit for like    minutes and hold a woman who is not here. Hold her now with you. You don't need to say her name out loud  you can just hold her. Are you holding her  This is  Break Clustered.  All holy history banned. Unwritten books predicted the future  projected the past. But my head unwraps around what appears limitless  man's creative violence. Whose son shall it be  Which male child will perish a new day  Our boys' deaths galvanize. We cherish corpses. We mourn women  complicated. Bitches get beat daily. Profits made  prophets ignored. War and tooth  enameled salted lemon childhoods. All colors run  none of us solid. Don't look for shadow behind me. I carry it within. I live cycles of light and darkness. Rhythm is half silence. I see now  I never was one and not the other. Sickness  health  tender violence. I think now I never was pure. Before form I was storm  blind  ign'ant    still am. Human contracted itself blind  malignant. I never was pure. Girl spoiled before ripened. Language can't math me. I experience exponentially. Everything is everything. One woman loses     maybe     members of her family. One woman loses six. One woman loses her head. One woman searches rubble. One woman feeds on trash. One woman shoots her face. One woman shoots her husband. One woman straps herself. One woman gives birth to a baby. One woman gives birth to borders. One woman no longer believes love will ever find her. One woman never did. Where do refugee hearts go  Broken  dissed  placed where they're not from  don't want to be missed. Faced with absence. We mourn each one or we mean nothing at all. My spine curves spiral. Precipice running to and running from human beings. Cluster bombs left behind. De facto landmines. A smoldering grief. Harvest contaminated tobacco. Harvest bombs. Harvest baby teeth. Harvest palms  smoke. Harvest witness  smoke. Resolutions  smoke. Salvation  smoke. Redemption  smoke. Breathe. Do not fear what has blown up. If you must  fear the unexploded. Thank you. What I thought I would do is I would start with a simple request. I'd like all of you to pause for a moment  you wretched weaklings  and take stock of your miserable existence. Now that was the advice that St. Benedict gave his rather startled followers in the fifth century. It was the advice that I decided to follow myself when I turned   . Up until that moment  I had been that classic corporate warrior    I was eating too much  I was drinking too much  I was working too hard and I was neglecting the family. And I decided that I would try and turn my life around. In particular  I decided I would try to address the thorny issue of work life balance. So I stepped back from the workforce  and I spent a year at home with my wife and four young children. But all I learned about work life balance from that year was that I found it quite easy to balance work and life when I didn't have any work. Not a very useful skill  especially when the money runs out. So I went back to work  and I've spent these seven years since struggling with  studying and writing about work life balance. And I have four observations I'd like to share with you today. The first is  if society's to make any progress on this issue  we need an honest debate. But the trouble is so many people talk so much rubbish about work life balance. All the discussions about flexi time or dress down Fridays or paternity leave only serve to mask the core issue  which is that certain job and career choices are fundamentally incompatible with being meaningfully engaged on a day to day basis with a young family. Now the first step in solving any problem is acknowledging the reality of the situation you're in. And the reality of the society that we're in is there are thousands and thousands of people out there leading lives of quiet  screaming desperation  where they work long  hard hours at jobs they hate to enable them to buy things they don't need to impress people they don't like. It's my contention that going to work on Friday in jeans and  a  T shirt isn't really getting to the nub of the issue. The second observation I'd like to make is we need to face the truth that governments and corporations aren't going to solve this issue for us. We should stop looking outside. It's up to us as individuals to take control and responsibility for the type of lives that we want to lead. If you don't design your life  someone else will design it for you  and you may just not like their idea of balance. It's particularly important    this isn't on the World Wide Web  is it  I'm about to get fired    it's particularly important that you never put the quality of your life in the hands of a commercial corporation. Now I'm not talking here just about the bad companies    the  abattoirs of the human soul   as I call them. I'm talking about all companies. Because commercial companies are inherently designed to get as much out of you  as  they can get away with. It's in their nature  it's in their DNA  it's what they do    even the good  well intentioned companies. On the one hand  putting childcare facilities in the workplace is wonderful and enlightened. On the other hand  it's a nightmare    it just means you spend more time at the bloody office. We have to be responsible for setting and enforcing the boundaries that we want in our life. The third observation is we have to be careful with the time frame that we choose upon which to judge our balance. Before I went back to work after my year at home  I sat down and I wrote out a detailed  step by step description of the ideal balanced day that I aspired to. And it went like this  wake up well rested after a good night's sleep. Have sex. Walk the dog. Have breakfast with my wife and children. Have sex again. Drive the kids to school on the way to the office. Do three hours' work. Play a sport with a friend at lunchtime. Do another three hours' work. Meet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink. Drive home for dinner with my wife and kids. Meditate for half an hour. Have sex. Walk the dog. Have sex again. Go to bed. How often do you think I have that day  We need to be realistic. You can't do it all in one day. We need to elongate the time frame upon which we judge the balance in our life  but we need to elongate it without falling into the trap of the  I'll have a life when I retire  when my kids have left home  when my wife has divorced me  my health is failing  I've got no mates or interests left.  A day is too short   after I retire  is too long. There's got to be a middle way. A fourth observation  We need to approach balance in a balanced way. A friend came to see me last year    and she doesn't mind me telling this story    a friend came to see me last year and said   Nigel  I've read your book. And I realize that my life is completely out of balance. It's totally dominated by work. I work    hours a day  I commute two hours a day. All of my relationships have failed. There's nothing in my life apart from my work. So I've decided to get a grip and sort it out. So I joined a gym.  Now I don't mean to mock  but being a fit    hour a day office rat isn't more balanced  it's more fit. Lovely though physical exercise may be  there are other parts to life    there's the intellectual side  there's the emotional side  there's the spiritual side. And to be balanced  I believe we have to attend to all of those areas    not just do    stomach crunches. Now that can be daunting. Because people say   Bloody hell mate  I haven't got time to get fit. You want me to go to church and call my mother.  And I understand. I truly understand how that can be daunting. But an incident that happened a couple of years ago gave me a new perspective. My wife  who is somewhere in the audience today  called me up at the office and said   Nigel  you need to pick our youngest son     Harry     up from school.  Because she had to be somewhere else with the other three children for that evening. So I left work an hour early that afternoon and picked Harry up at the school gates. We walked down to the local park  messed around on the swings  played some silly games. I then walked him up the hill to the local cafe  and we shared a pizza for two  then walked down the hill to our home  and I gave him his bath and put him in his Batman pajamas. I then read him a chapter of Roald Dahl's  James and the Giant Peach.  I then put him to bed  tucked him in  gave him a kiss on his forehead and said   Goodnight  mate   and walked out of his bedroom. As I was walking out of his bedroom  he said   Dad   I went   Yes  mate   He went   Dad  this has been the best day of my life  ever.  I hadn't done anything  hadn't taken him to Disney World or bought him a Playstation. Now my point is the small things matter. Being more balanced doesn't mean dramatic upheaval in your life. With the smallest investment in the right places  you can radically transform the quality of your relationships and the quality of your life. Moreover  I think  it can transform society. Because if enough people do it  we can change society's definition of success away from the moronically simplistic notion that the person with the most money when he dies wins  to a more thoughtful and balanced definition of what a life well lived looks like. And that  I think  is an idea worth spreading. Ever since I was a little girl seeing  Star Wars  for the first time  I've been fascinated by this idea of personal robots. And as a little girl  I loved the idea of a robot that interacted with us much more like a helpful  trusted sidekick    something that would delight us  enrich our lives and help us save a galaxy or two. I knew robots like that didn't really exist  but I knew I wanted to build them. So    years pass    I am now a graduate student at MIT studying artificial intelligence  the year is       and NASA has just landed the first robot on Mars. But robots are still not in our home  ironically. And I remember thinking about all the reasons why that was the case. But one really struck me. Robotics had really been about interacting with things  not with people    certainly not in a social way that would be natural for us and would really help people accept robots into our daily lives. For me  that was the white space  that's what robots could not do yet. And so that year  I started to build this robot  Kismet  the world's first social robot. Three years later    a lot of programming  working with other graduate students in the lab    Kismet was ready to start interacting with people. Kismet   Nonsense  Scientist  This is a watch that my girlfriend gave me. Kismet   Nonsense  Scientist  Yeah  look  it's got a little blue light in it too. I almost lost it this week. Cynthia Breazeal  So Kismet interacted with people like kind of a non verbal child or pre verbal child  which I assume was fitting because it was really the first of its kind. It didn't speak language  but it didn't matter. This little robot was somehow able to tap into something deeply social within us    and with that  the promise of an entirely new way we could interact with robots. So over the past several years I've been continuing to explore this interpersonal dimension of robots  now at the media lab with my own team of incredibly talented students. And one of my favorite robots is Leonardo. We developed Leonardo in collaboration with Stan Winston Studio. And so I want to show you a special moment for me of Leo. This is Matt Berlin interacting with Leo  introducing Leo to a new object. And because it's new  Leo doesn't really know what to make of it. But sort of like us  he can actually learn about it from watching Matt's reaction. Leo  this is Cookie Monster. Can you find Cookie Monster  Leo  Cookie Monster is very bad. He's very bad  Leo. Cookie Monster is very  very bad. He's a scary monster. He wants to get your cookies. CB  All right  so Leo and Cookie might have gotten off to a little bit of a rough start  but they get along great now. So what I've learned through building these systems is that robots are actually a really intriguing social technology  where it's actually their ability to push our social buttons and to interact with us like a partner that is a core part of their functionality. And with that shift in thinking  we can now start to imagine new questions  new possibilities for robots that we might not have thought about otherwise. But what do I mean when I say  push our social buttons   Well  one of the things that we've learned is that  if we design these robots to communicate with us using the same body language  the same sort of non verbal cues that people use    like Nexi  our humanoid robot  is doing here    what we find is that people respond to robots a lot like they respond to people. People use these cues to determine things like how persuasive someone is  how likable  how engaging  how trustworthy. It turns out it's the same for robots. It's turning out now that robots are actually becoming a really interesting new scientific tool to understand human behavior. To answer questions like  how is it that  from a brief encounter  we're able to make an estimate of how trustworthy another person is  Mimicry's believed to play a role  but how  Is it the mimicking of particular gestures that matters  It turns out it's really hard to learn this or understand this from watching people because when we interact we do all of these cues automatically. We can't carefully control them because they're subconscious for us. But with the robot  you can. And so in this video here    this is a video taken from David DeSteno's lab at Northeastern University. He's a psychologist we've been collaborating with. There's actually a scientist carefully controlling Nexi's cues to be able to study this question. And the bottom line is    the reason why this works is because it turns out people just behave like people even when interacting with a robot. So given that key insight  we can now start to imagine new kinds of applications for robots. For instance  if robots do respond to our non verbal cues  maybe they would be a cool  new communication technology. So imagine this  What about a robot accessory for your cellphone  You call your friend  she puts her handset in a robot  and  bam  You're a MeBot    you can make eye contact  you can talk with your friends  you can move around  you can gesture    maybe the next best thing to really being there  or is it  To explore this question  my student  Siggy Adalgeirsson  did a study where we brought human participants  people  into our lab to do a collaborative task with a remote collaborator. The task involved things like looking at a set of objects on the table  discussing them in terms of their importance and relevance to performing a certain task    this ended up being a survival task    and then rating them in terms of how valuable and important they thought they were. The remote collaborator was an experimenter from our group who used one of three different technologies to interact with the participants. The first was just the screen. This is just like video conferencing today. The next was to add mobility    so  have the screen on a mobile base. This is like  if you're familiar with any of the telepresence robots today    this is mirroring that situation. And then the fully expressive MeBot. So after the interaction  we asked people to rate their quality of interaction with the technology  with a remote collaborator through this technology  in a number of different ways. We looked at psychological involvement    how much empathy did you feel for the other person  We looked at overall engagement. We looked at their desire to cooperate. And this is what we see when they use just the screen. It turns out  when you add mobility    the ability to roll around the table    you get a little more of a boost. And you get even more of a boost when you add the full expression. So it seems like this physical  social embodiment actually really makes a difference. Now let's try to put this into a little bit of context. Today we know that families are living further and further apart  and that definitely takes a toll on family relationships and family bonds over distance. For me  I have three young boys  and I want them to have a really good relationship with their grandparents. But my parents live thousands of miles away  so they just don't get to see each other that often. We try Skype  we try phone calls  but my boys are little    they don't really want to talk  they want to play. So I love the idea of thinking about robots as a new kind of distance play technology. I imagine a time not too far from now    my mom can go to her computer  open up a browser and jack into a little robot. And as grandma bot  she can now play  really play  with my sons  with her grandsons  in the real world with his real toys. I could imagine grandmothers being able to do social plays with their granddaughters  with their friends  and to be able to share all kinds of other activities around the house  like sharing a bedtime story. And through this technology  being able to be an active participant in their grandchildren's lives in a way that's not possible today. Let's think about some other domains  like maybe health. So in the United States today  over    percent of people are either overweight or obese  and now it's a big problem with our children as well. And we know that as you get older in life  if you're obese when you're younger  that can lead to chronic diseases that not only reduce your quality of life  but are a tremendous economic burden on our health care system. But if robots can be engaging  if we like to cooperate with robots  if robots are persuasive  maybe a robot can help you maintain a diet and exercise program  maybe they can help you manage your weight. Sort of like a digital Jiminy    as in the well known fairy tale    a kind of friendly  supportive presence that's always there to be able to help you make the right decision in the right way at the right time to help you form healthy habits. So we actually explored this idea in our lab. This is a robot  Autom. Cory Kidd developed this robot for his doctoral work. And it was designed to be a robot diet and exercise coach. It had a couple of simple non verbal skills it could do. It could make eye contact with you. It could share information looking down at a screen. You'd use a screen interface to enter information  like how many calories you ate that day  how much exercise you got. And then it could help track that for you. And the robot spoke with a synthetic voice to engage you in a coaching dialogue modeled after trainers and patients and so forth. And it would build a working alliance with you through that dialogue. It could help you set goals and track your progress  and it would help motivate you. So an interesting question is  does the social embodiment really matter  Does it matter that it's a robot  Is it really just the quality of advice and information that matters  To explore that question  we did a study in the Boston area where we put one of three interventions in people's homes for a period of several weeks. One case was the robot you saw there  Autom. Another was a computer that ran the same touch screen interface  ran exactly the same dialogues. The quality of advice was identical. And the third was just a pen and paper log  because that's the standard intervention you typically get when you start a diet and exercise program. So one of the things we really wanted to look at was not how much weight people lost  but really how long they interacted with the robot. Because the challenge is not losing weight  it's actually keeping it off. And the longer you could interact with one of these interventions  well that's indicative  potentially  of longer term success. So the first thing I want to look at is how long  how long did people interact with these systems. It turns out that people interacted with the robot significantly more  even though the quality of the advice was identical to the computer. When it asked people to rate it on terms of the quality of the working alliance  people rated the robot higher and they trusted the robot more. And when you look at emotional engagement  it was completely different. People would name the robots. They would dress the robots. And even when we would come up to pick up the robots at the end of the study  they would come out to the car and say good bye to the robots. They didn't do this with a computer. The last thing I want to talk about today is the future of children's media. We know that kids spend a lot of time behind screens today  whether it's television or computer games or whatnot. My sons  they love the screen. They love the screen. But I want them to play  as a mom  I want them to play  like  real world play. And so I have a new project in my group I wanted to present to you today called Playtime Computing that's really trying to think about how we can take what's so engaging about digital media and literally bring it off the screen into the real world of the child  where it can take on many of the properties of real world play. So here's the first exploration of this idea  where characters can be physical or virtual  and where the digital content can literally come off the screen into the world and back. I like to think of this as the Atari Pong of this blended reality play. But we can push this idea further. What if    CB     the character itself could come into your world  It turns out that kids love it when the character becomes real and enters into their world. And when it's in their world  they can relate to it and play with it in a way that's fundamentally different from how they play with it on the screen. Another important idea is this notion of persistence of character across realities. So changes that children make in the real world need to translate to the virtual world. So here  Nathan has changed the letter A to the number  . You can imagine maybe these symbols give the characters special powers when it goes into the virtual world. So they are now sending the character back into that world. And now it's got number power. And then finally  what I've been trying to do here is create a really immersive experience for kids  where they really feel like they are part of that story  a part of that experience. And I really want to spark their imaginations the way mine was sparked as a little girl watching  Star Wars.  But I want to do more than that. I actually want them to create those experiences. I want them to be able to literally build their imagination into these experiences and make them their own. So we've been exploring a lot of ideas in telepresence and mixed reality to literally allow kids to project their ideas into this space where other kids can interact with them and build upon them. I really want to come up with new ways of children's media that foster creativity and learning and innovation. I think that's very  very important. So this is a new project. We've invited a lot of kids into this space  and they think it's pretty cool. But I can tell you  the thing that they love the most is the robot. What they care about is the robot. Robots touch something deeply human within us. And so whether they're helping us to become creative and innovative  or whether they're helping us to feel more deeply connected despite distance  or whether they are our trusted sidekick who's helping us attain our personal goals in becoming our highest and best selves  for me  robots are all about people. Thank you. Hawa Abdi  Many people       years for Somalia     were  fighting. So there was no job  no food. Children  most of them  became very malnourished  like this. Deqo Mohamed  So as you know  always in a civil war  the ones affected most  are  the women and children. So our patients are women and children. And they are in our backyard. It's our home. We welcome them. That's the camp that we have in now        people  where    percent of them are women and children. Pat Mitchell  And this is your hospital. This is the inside. HA  We are doing C sections and different operations because people need some help. There is no government to protect them. DM  Every morning we have about     patients  maybe more or less. But sometimes we are only five doctors and    nurses  and we are physically getting exhausted to see all of them. But we take the severe ones  and we reschedule the other ones the next day. It is very tough. And as you can see  it's the women who are carrying the children  it's the women who come into the hospitals  it's the women  are  building the houses. That's their house. And we have a school. This is our bright    we opened  in the  last two years  an  elementary school where we have     children  and the majority are women and girls. PM  And the doctors have some very big rules about who can get treated at the clinic. Would you explain the rules for admission  HA  The people who are coming to us  we are welcoming. We are sharing with them whatever we have. But there are only two rules. First rule  there is no clan distinguished and political division in Somali society.  Whomever  makes those things we throw out. The second  no man can beat his wife. If he beat  we will put  him  in jail  and we will call the eldest people. Until they identify this case  we'll never release him. That's our two rules. The other thing that I have realized  that the woman is the most strong person all over the world. Because the last    years  the Somali woman has stood up. They were the leaders  and we are the leaders of our community and the hope of our future generations. We are not just the helpless and the victims of the civil war. We can reconcile. We can do everything. DM  As my mother said  we are the future hope  and the men are only killing in Somalia. So we came up with these two rules. In a camp with        people  you have to come up with some rules or there is going to be some fights. So there is no clan division  and no man can beat his wife. And we have a little storage room where we converted a jail. So if you beat your wife  you're going to be there. So empowering the women and giving the opportunity    we are there for them. They are not alone for this. PM  You're running a medical clinic. It brought much  much needed medical care to people who wouldn't get it. You're also running a civil society. You've created your own rules  in which women and children are getting a different sense of security. Talk to me about your decision  Dr. Abdi  and your decision  Dr. Mohamed  to work together    for you to become a doctor and to work with your mother in these circumstances. HA  My age    because I was born in         we were having  at that time  government  law and order. But one day  I went to the hospital    my mother was sick    and I saw the hospital  how they  were  treating the doctors  how they  are  committed to help the sick people. I admired them  and I decided to become a doctor. My mother died  unfortunately  when I was    years  old . Then my father allowed me to proceed  with  my hope. My mother died in  a  gynecology complication  so I decided to become a gynecology specialist. That's why I became a doctor. So Dr. Deqo has to explain. DM  For me  my mother was preparing  me  when I was a child to become a doctor  but I really didn't want to. Maybe I should become an historian  or maybe a reporter. I loved it  but it didn't work. When the war broke out    civil war    I saw how my mother was helping and how she really needed the help  and how the care is essential to the woman to be a woman doctor in Somalia and help the women and children. And I thought  maybe I can be a reporter and doctor gynecologist. So I went to Russia  and my mother also   during the  time of  the  Soviet Union. So some of our character  maybe we will come with a strong Soviet background of training. So that's how I decided  to do  the same. My sister was different. She's here. She's also a doctor. She graduated in Russia also. And to go back and to work with our mother is just what we saw in the civil war    when I was     and my sister was     when the civil war broke out. So it was the need and the people we saw in the early '  s    that's what made us go back and work for them. PM  So what is the biggest challenge working  mother and daughter  in such dangerous and sometimes scary situations  HA  Yes  I was working in a tough situation  very dangerous. And when I saw the people who needed me  I was staying with them to help  because I  could  do something for them. Most people fled abroad. But I remained with those people  and I was trying to do something     any  little thing I  could  do. I succeeded in my place. Now my place is        people who are respecting each other  who are not fighting. But we try to stand on our feet  to do something  little things  we can for our people. And I'm thankful for my daughters. When they come to me  they help me to treat the people  to help. They do everything for them. They have done what I desire to do for them. PM  What's the best part of working with your mother  and the most challenging part for you  DM  She's very tough  it's most challenging. She always expects us to do more. And really when you think  you  cannot do it  she will push you  and I can do it. That's the best part. She shows us  trains us how to do and how to be better  people  and how to do long hours in surgery        patients per day         surgeries  and still you have to manage the camp    that's how she trains us. It is not like beautiful offices here     patients  you're tired. You see     patients     surgeries and        people to manage. PM  But you do it for good reasons. Wait. Wait. HA  Thank you. DM  Thank you. HA  Thank you very much. DM  Thank you very much. I'd like to start with a couple of quick examples. These are spinneret glands on the abdomen of a spider. They produce six different types of silk  which is spun together into a fiber  tougher than any fiber humans have ever made. The nearest we've come is with aramid fiber. And to make that  it involves extremes of temperature  extremes of pressure and loads of pollution. And yet the spider manages to do it at ambient temperature and pressure with raw materials of dead flies and water. It does suggest we've still got a bit to learn. This beetle can detect a forest fire at    kilometers away. That's roughly        times the range of man made fire detectors. And what's more  this guy doesn't need a wire connected all the way back to a power station burning fossil fuels. So these two examples give a sense of what biomimicry can deliver. If we could learn to make things and do things the way nature does  we could achieve factor     factor      maybe even factor       savings in resource and energy use. And if we're to make progress with the sustainability revolution  I believe there are three really big changes we need to bring about. Firstly  radical increases in resource efficiency. Secondly  shifting from a linear  wasteful  polluting way of using resources to a closed loop model. And thirdly  changing from a fossil fuel economy to a solar economy. And for all three of these  I believe  biomimicry has a lot of the solutions that we're going to need. You could look at nature as being like a catalog of products  and all of those have benefited from a  .  billion year research and development period. And given that level of investment  it makes sense to use it. So I'm going to talk about some projects that have explored these ideas. And let's start with radical increases in resource efficiency. When we were working on the Eden Project  we had to create a very large greenhouse in a site that was not only irregular  but it was continually changing because it was still being quarried. It was a hell of a challenge  and it was actually examples from biology that provided a lot of the clues. So for instance  it was soap bubbles that helped us generate a building form that would work regardless of the final ground levels. Studying pollen grains and radiolaria and carbon molecules helped us devise the most efficient structural solution using hexagons and pentagons. The next move was that we wanted to try and maximize the size of those hexagons. And to do that we had to find an alternative to glass  which is really very limited in terms of its unit sizes. And in nature there are lots of examples of very efficient structures based on pressurized membranes. So we started exploring this material called ETFE. It's a high strength polymer. And what you do is you put it together in three layers  you weld it around the edge  and then you inflate it. And the great thing about this stuff is you can make it in units of roughly seven times the size of glass  and it was only one percent of the weight of double glazing. So that was a factor     saving. And what we found is that we got into a positive cycle in which one breakthrough facilitated another. So with such large  lightweight pillows  we had much less steel. With less steel we were getting more sunlight in  which meant we didn't have to put as much extra heat in winter. And with less overall weight in the superstructure  there were big savings in the foundations. And at the end of the project we worked out that the weight of that superstructure was actually less than the weight of the air inside the building. So I think the Eden Project is a fairly good example of how ideas from biology can lead to radical increases in resource efficiency    delivering the same function  but with a fraction of the resource input. And actually there are loads of examples in nature that you could turn to for similar solutions. So for instance  you could develop super efficient roof structures based on giant Amazon water lilies  whole buildings inspired by abalone shells  super lightweight bridges inspired by plant cells. There's a world of beauty and efficiency to explore here using nature as a design tool. So now I want to go onto talking about the linear to closed loop idea. The way we tend to use resources is we extract them  we turn them into short life products and then dispose of them. Nature works very differently. In ecosystems  the waste from one organism becomes the nutrient for something else in that system. And there are some examples of projects that have deliberately tried to mimic ecosystems. And one of my favorites is called the Cardboard to Caviar Project by Graham Wiles. And in their area they had a lot of shops and restaurants that were producing lots of food  cardboard and plastic waste. It was ending up in landfills. Now the really clever bit is what they did with the cardboard waste. And I'm just going to talk through this animation. So they were paid to collect it from the restaurants. They then shredded the cardboard and sold it to equestrian centers as horse bedding. When that was soiled  they were paid again to collect it. They put it into worm recomposting systems  which produced a lot of worms  which they fed to Siberian sturgeon  which produced caviar  which they sold back to the restaurants. So it transformed a linear process into a closed loop model  and it created more value in the process. Graham Wiles has continued to add more and more elements to this  turning waste streams into schemes that create value. And just as natural systems tend to increase in diversity and resilience over time  there's a real sense with this project that the number of possibilities just continue increasing. And I know it's a quirky example  but I think the implications of this are quite radical  because it suggests that we could actually transform a big problem    waste    into a massive opportunity. And particularly in cities    we could look at the whole metabolism of cities  and look at those as opportunities. And that's what we're doing on the next project I'm going to talk about  the Mobius Project  where we're trying to bring together a number of activities  all within one building  so that the waste from one can be the nutrient for another. And the kind of elements I'm talking about are  firstly  we have a restaurant inside a productive greenhouse  a bit like this one in Amsterdam called De Kas. Then we would have an anaerobic digester  which could deal with all the biodegradable waste from the local area  turn that into heat for the greenhouse and electricity to feed back into the grid. We'd have a water treatment system treating wastewater  turning that into fresh water and generating energy from the solids using just plants and micro organisms. We'd have a fish farm fed with vegetable waste from the kitchen and worms from the compost and supplying fish back to the restaurant. And we'd also have a coffee shop  and the waste grains from that could be used as a substrate for growing mushrooms. So you can see that we're bringing together cycles of food  energy and water and waste all within one building. And just for fun  we've proposed this for a roundabout in central London  which at the moment is a complete eyesore. Some of you may recognize this. And with just a little bit of planning  we could transform a space dominated by traffic into one that provides open space for people  reconnects people with food and transforms waste into closed loop opportunities. So the final project I want to talk about is the Sahara Forest Project  which we're working on at the moment. It may come as a surprise to some of you to hear that quite large areas of what are currently desert were actually forested a fairly short time ago. So for instance  when Julius Caesar arrived in North Africa  huge areas of North Africa were covered in cedar and cypress forests. And during the evolution of life on the Earth  it was the colonization of the land by plants that helped create the benign climate we currently enjoy. The converse is also true. The more vegetation we lose  the more that's likely to exacerbate climate change and lead to further desertification. And this animation  this shows photosynthetic activity over the course of a number of years  and what you can see is that the boundaries of those deserts shift quite a lot  and that raises the question of whether we can intervene at the boundary conditions to halt  or maybe even reverse  desertification. And if you look at some of the organisms that have evolved to live in deserts  there are some amazing examples of adaptations to water scarcity. This is the Namibian fog basking beetle  and it's evolved a way of harvesting its own fresh water in a desert. The way it does this is it comes out at night  crawls to the top of a sand dune  and because it's got a matte black shell  is able to radiate heat out to the night sky and become slightly cooler than its surroundings. So when the moist breeze blows in off the sea  you get these droplets of water forming on the beetle's shell. Just before sunrise  he tips his shell up  the water runs down into his mouth  has a good drink  goes off and hides for the rest of the day. And the ingenuity  if you could call it that  goes even further. Because if you look closely at the beetle's shell  there are lots of little bumps on that shell. And those bumps are hydrophilic  they attract water. Between them there's a waxy finish which repels water. And the effect of this is that as the droplets start to form on the bumps  they stay in tight  spherical beads  which means they're much more mobile than they would be if it was just a film of water over the whole beetle's shell. So even when there's only a small amount of moisture in the air  it's able to harvest that very effectively and channel it down to its mouth. So amazing example of an adaptation to a very resource constrained environment    and in that sense  very relevant to the kind of challenges we're going to be facing over the next few years  next few decades. We're working with the guy who invented the Seawater Greenhouse. This is a greenhouse designed for arid coastal regions  and the way it works is that you have this whole wall of evaporator grills  and you trickle seawater over that so that wind blows through  it picks up a lot of moisture and is cooled in the process. So inside it's cool and humid  which means the plants need less water to grow. And then at the back of the greenhouse  it condenses a lot of that humidity as freshwater in a process that is effectively identical to the beetle. And what they found with the first Seawater Greenhouse that was built was it was producing slightly more freshwater than it needed for the plants inside. So they just started spreading this on the land around  and the combination of that and the elevated humidity had quite a dramatic effect on the local area. This photograph was taken on completion day  and just one year later  it looked like that. So it was like a green inkblot spreading out from the building turning barren land back into biologically productive land    and in that sense  going beyond sustainable design to achieve restorative design. So we were keen to scale this up and apply biomimicry ideas to maximize the benefits. And when you think about nature  often you think about it as being all about competition. But actually in mature ecosystems  you're just as likely to find examples of symbiotic relationships. So an important biomimicry principle is to find ways of bringing technologies together in symbiotic clusters. And the technology that we settled on as an ideal partner for the Seawater Greenhouse is concentrated solar power  which uses solar tracking mirrors to focus the sun's heat to create electricity. And just to give you some sense of the potential of CSP  consider that we receive        times as much energy from the sun every year as we use in energy from all forms           times. So our energy problems are not intractable. It's a challenge to our ingenuity. And the kind of synergies I'm talking about are  firstly  both these technologies work very well in hot  sunny deserts. CSP needs a supply of demineralized freshwater. That's exactly what the Seawater Greenhouse produces. CSP produces a lot of waste heat. We'll be able to make use of all that to evaporate more seawater and enhance the restorative benefits. And finally  in the shade under the mirrors  it's possible to grow all sorts of crops that would not grow in direct sunlight. So this is how this scheme would look. The idea is we create this long hedge of greenhouses facing the wind. We'd have concentrated solar power plants at intervals along the way. Some of you might be wondering what we would do with all the salts. And with biomimicry  if you've got an underutilized resource  you don't think   How am I going to dispose of this   You think   What can I add to the system to create more value   And it turns out that different things crystallize out at different stages. When you evaporate seawater  the first thing to crystallize out is calcium carbonate. And that builds up on the evaporators    and that's what that image on the left is    gradually getting encrusted with the calcium carbonate. So after a while  we could take that out  use it as a lightweight building block. And if you think about the carbon in that  that would have come out of the atmosphere  into the sea and then locked away in a building product. The next thing is sodium chloride. You can also compress that into a building block  as they did here. This is a hotel in Bolivia. And then after that  there are all sorts of compounds and elements that we can extract  like phosphates  that we need to get back into the desert soils to fertilize them. And there's just about every element of the periodic table in seawater. So it should be possible to extract valuable elements like lithium for high performance batteries. And in parts of the Arabian Gulf  the seawater  the salinity is increasing steadily due to the discharge of waste brine from desalination plants. And it's pushing the ecosystem close to collapse. Now we would be able to make use of all that waste brine. We could evaporate it to enhance the restorative benefits and capture the salts  transforming an urgent waste problem into a big opportunity. Really the Sahara Forest Project is a model for how we could create zero carbon food  abundant renewable energy in some of the most water stressed parts of the planet as well as reversing desertification in certain areas. So returning to those big challenges that I mentioned at the beginning  radical increases in resource efficiency  closing loops and a solar economy. They're not just possible  they're critical. And I firmly believe that studying the way nature solves problems will provide a lot of the solutions. But perhaps more than anything  what this thinking provides is a really positive way of talking about sustainable design. Far too much of the talk about the environment uses very negative language. But here it's about synergies and abundance and optimizing. And this is an important point. Antoine de Saint Exupery once said   If you want to build a flotilla of ships  you don't sit around talking about carpentry. No  you need to set people's souls ablaze with visions of exploring distant shores.  And that's what we need to do  so let's be positive  and let's make progress with what could be the most exciting period of innovation we've ever seen. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. That was whistling. I'm trying to do this in English. What is a chubby  curly haired guy from Holland    why is he whistling  Well actually  I've  been  whistling since the age of four  about four. My dad was always whistling around the house  and I just thought that's part of communication in my family. So I whistled along with him. And actually  till I was     I always annoyed and irritated people with whistling  because  to be honest  my whistling is a kind of deviant behavior. I whistled alone. I whistled in the classroom. I whistled on  my  bike. I whistled everywhere. And I also whistled at a Christmas Eve party with my family in law. And they had some  in my opinion  terrible Christmas music. And when I hear music that I don't like  I try to make it better. So  Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer     you know it  But it can also sound like this. But during a Christmas party    at dinner actually    it's very annoying. So my sister in law asked me a few times   Please stop whistling.  And I just couldn't. And at one point    and I had some wine  I have to admit that    at one point I said   If there was a contest  I would join.  And two weeks later I received a text message   You're going to America.  So  okay  I'm going to America. I would love to  but why  So I immediately called her up  of course. She Googled  and she found this World Whistling Championship in America  of course. She didn't expect me to go there. And I would have lost my face. I don't know if that's correct English. But the Dutch people here will understand what I mean. I lost my face. And she thought   He will never go there.  But actually I did. So I went to Louisburg  North Carolina  southeast United States  and I entered the world of whistling. And I also entered the world championship  and I won there in     . That was great fun  of course. And to defend my title    like judokas do and sportsmen    I thought  well let's go back in       and I won again. Then I couldn't participate for a few years. And in      I entered again in Japan  Tokyo  and I won again. So what happened now is I'm standing here in Rotterdam  in the beautiful city  on a big stage  and I'm talking about whistling. And actually I earn my money whistling at the moment. So I quit my day job as a nurse. And I try to live my dream    well  actually  it was never my dream  but it sounds so good. Okay  I'm not the only one whistling here. You say   Huh  what do you mean   Well actually  you are going to whistle along. And then always the same thing happens  people are watching each other and think   Oh  my God. Why  Can I go away   No  you can't. Actually it's very simple. The track that I will whistle is called  F te de la Belle.  It's about    minutes long. No  no  no. It's four minutes long. And I want to first rehearse with you your whistling. So I whistle the tone. Sorry. I forgot one thing. You whistle the same tone as me. I heard a wide variety of tones. This is very promising. This is very promising. I'll ask the technicians to start the music. And if it's started  I just point where you whistle along  and we will see what happens. Oh  hah. I'm so sorry  technicians. I'm so used to that. I start it myself. Okay  here it is. Okay. It's easy  isn't it  Now comes the solo. I propose I do that myself. Max Westerman  Geert Chatrou  the World Champion  of  Whistling. Geert Chatrou  Thank you. Thank you. We're here to celebrate compassion. But compassion  from my vantage point  has a problem. As essential as it is across our traditions  as real as so many of us know it to be in particular lives  the word  compassion  is hollowed out in our culture  and it is suspect in my field of journalism. It's seen as a squishy kumbaya thing  or it's seen as potentially depressing. Karen Armstrong has told what I think is an iconic story of giving a speech in Holland and  after the fact  the word  compassion  was translated as  pity.  Now compassion  when it enters the news  too often comes in the form of feel good feature pieces or sidebars about heroic people you could never be like or happy endings or examples of self sacrifice that would seem to be too good to be true most of the time. Our cultural imagination about compassion has been deadened by idealistic images. And so what I'd like to do this morning for the next few minutes is perform a linguistic resurrection. And I hope you'll come with me on my basic premise that words matter  that they shape the way we understand ourselves  the way we interpret the world and the way we treat others. When this country first encountered genuine diversity in the     s  we adopted tolerance as the core civic virtue with which we would approach that. Now the word  tolerance   if you look at it in the dictionary  connotes  allowing    indulging  and  enduring.  In the medical context that it comes from  it is about testing the limits of thriving in an unfavorable environment. Tolerance is not really a lived virtue  it's more of a cerebral ascent. And it's too cerebral to animate guts and hearts and behavior when the going gets rough. And the going is pretty rough right now. I think that without perhaps being able to name it  we are collectively experiencing that we've come as far as we can with tolerance as our only guiding virtue. Compassion is a worthy successor. It is organic  across our religious  spiritual and ethical traditions  and yet it transcends them. Compassion is a piece of vocabulary that could change us if we truly let it sink into the standards to which we hold ourselves and others  both in our private and in our civic spaces. So what is it  three dimensionally  What are its kindred and component parts  What's in its universe of attendant virtues  To start simply  I want to say that compassion is kind. Now  kindness  might sound like a very mild word  and it's prone to its own abundant cliche. But kindness is an everyday byproduct of all the great virtues. And it is a most edifying form of instant gratification. Compassion is also curious. Compassion cultivates and practices curiosity. I love a phrase that was offered me by two young women who are interfaith innovators in Los Angeles  Aziza Hasan and Malka Fenyvesi. They are working to create a new imagination about shared life among young Jews and Muslims  and as they do that  they cultivate what they call  curiosity without assumptions.  Well that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion. Compassion can be synonymous with empathy. It can be joined with the harder work of forgiveness and reconciliation  but it can also express itself in the simple act of presence. It's linked to practical virtues like generosity and hospitality and just being there  just showing up. I think that compassion also is often linked to beauty    and by that I mean a willingness to see beauty in the other  not just what it is about them that might need helping. I love it that my Muslim conversation partners often speak of beauty as a core moral value. And in that light  for the religious  compassion also brings us into the territory of mystery    encouraging us not just to see beauty  but perhaps also to look for the face of God in the moment of suffering  in the face of a stranger  in the face of the vibrant religious other. I'm not sure if I can show you what tolerance looks like  but I can show you what compassion looks like    because it is visible. When we see it  we recognize it and it changes the way we think about what is doable  what is possible. It is so important when we're communicating big ideas    but especially a big spiritual idea like compassion    to root it as we present it to others in space and time and flesh and blood    the color and complexity of life. And compassion does seek physicality. I first started to learn this most vividly from Matthew Sanford. And I don't imagine that you will realize this when you look at this photograph of him  but he's paraplegic. He's been paralyzed from the waist down since he was     in a car crash that killed his father and his sister. Matthew's legs don't work  and he'll never walk again  and    and he does experience this as an  and  rather than a  but     and he experiences himself to be healed and whole. And as a teacher of yoga  he brings that experience to others across the spectrum of ability and disability  health  illness and aging. He says that he's just at an extreme end of the spectrum we're all on. He's doing some amazing work now with veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan. And Matthew has made this remarkable observation that I'm just going to offer you and let it sit. I can't quite explain it  and he can't either. But he says that he has yet to experience someone who became more aware of their body  in all its frailty and its grace  without  at the same time  becoming more compassionate towards all of life. Compassion also looks like this. This is Jean Vanier. Jean Vanier helped found the L'Arche communities  which you can now find all over the world  communities centered around life with people with mental disabilities    mostly Down syndrome. The communities that Jean Vanier founded  like Jean Vanier himself  exude tenderness.  Tender  is another word I would love to spend some time resurrecting. We spend so much time in this culture being driven and aggressive  and I spend a lot of time being those things too. And compassion can also have those qualities. But again and again  lived compassion brings us back to the wisdom of tenderness. Jean Vanier says that his work  like the work of other people    his great  beloved  late friend Mother Teresa    is never in the first instance about changing the world  it's in the first instance about changing ourselves. He's says that what they do with L'Arche is not a solution  but a sign. Compassion is rarely a solution  but it is always a sign of a deeper reality  of deeper human possibilities. And compassion is unleashed in wider and wider circles by signs and stories  never by statistics and strategies. We need those things too  but we're also bumping up against their limits. And at the same time that we are doing that  I think we are rediscovering the power of story    that as human beings  we need stories to survive  to flourish  to change. Our traditions have always known this  and that is why they have always cultivated stories at their heart and carried them forward in time for us. There is  of course  a story behind the key moral longing and commandment of Judaism to repair the world    tikkun olam. And I'll never forget hearing that story from Dr. Rachel Naomi Remen  who told it to me as her grandfather told it to her  that in the beginning of the Creation something happened and the original light of the universe was shattered into countless pieces. It lodged as shards inside every aspect of the Creation. And that the highest human calling is to look for this light  to point at it when we see it  to gather it up  and in so doing  to repair the world. Now this might sound like a fanciful tale. Some of my fellow journalists might interpret it that way. Rachel Naomi Remen says this is an important and empowering story for our time  because this story insists that each and every one of us  frail and flawed as we may be  inadequate as we may feel  has exactly what's needed to help repair the part of the world that we can see and touch. Stories like this  signs like this  are practical tools in a world longing to bring compassion to abundant images of suffering that can otherwise overwhelm us. Rachel Naomi Remen is actually bringing compassion back to its rightful place alongside science in her field of medicine in the training of new doctors. And this trend of what Rachel Naomi Remen is doing  how these kinds of virtues are finding a place in the vocabulary of medicine    the work Fred Luskin is doing    I think this is one of the most fascinating developments of the   st century    that science  in fact  is taking a virtue like compassion definitively out of the realm of idealism. This is going to change science  I believe  and it will change religion. But here's a face from   th century science that might surprise you in a discussion about compassion. We all know about the Albert Einstein who came up with E   mc . We don't hear so much about the Einstein who invited the African American opera singer  Marian Anderson  to stay in his home when she came to sing in Princeton because the best hotel there was segregated and wouldn't have her. We don't hear about the Einstein who used his celebrity to advocate for political prisoners in Europe or the Scottsboro boys in the American South. Einstein believed deeply that science should transcend national and ethnic divisions. But he watched physicists and chemists become the purveyors of weapons of mass destruction in the early   th century. He once said that science in his generation had become like a razor blade in the hands of a three year old. And Einstein foresaw that as we grow more modern and technologically advanced  we need the virtues our traditions carry forward in time more  not less. He liked to talk about the spiritual geniuses of the ages. Some of his favorites were Moses  Jesus  Buddha  St. Francis of Assisi  Gandhi    he adored his contemporary  Gandhi. And Einstein said    and I think this is a quote  again  that has not been passed down in his legacy    that  these kinds of people are geniuses in the art of living  more necessary to the dignity  security and joy of humanity than the discoverers of objective knowledge.  Now invoking Einstein might not seem the best way to bring compassion down to earth and make it seem accessible to all the rest of us  but actually it is. I want to show you the rest of this photograph  because this photograph is analogous to what we do to the word  compassion  in our culture    we clean it up and we diminish its depths and its grounding in life  which is messy. So in this photograph you see a mind looking out a window at what might be a cathedral    it's not. This is the full photograph  and you see a middle aged man wearing a leather jacket  smoking a cigar. And by the look of that paunch  he hasn't been doing enough yoga. We put these two photographs side by side on our website  and someone said   When I look at the first photo  I ask myself  what was he thinking  And when I look at the second  I ask  what kind of person was he  What kind of man is this   Well  he was complicated. He was incredibly compassionate in some of his relationships and terribly inadequate in others. And it is much harder  often  to be compassionate towards those closest to us  which is another quality in the universe of compassion  on its dark side  that also deserves our serious attention and illumination. Gandhi  too  was a real flawed human being. So was Martin Luther King  Jr. So was Dorothy Day. So was Mother Teresa. So are we all. And I want to say that it is a liberating thing to realize that that is no obstacle to compassion    following on what Fred Luskin says    that these flaws just make us human. Our culture is obsessed with perfection and with hiding problems. But what a liberating thing to realize that our problems  in fact  are probably our richest sources for rising to this ultimate virtue of compassion  towards bringing compassion towards the suffering and joys of others. Rachel Naomi Remen is a better doctor because of her life long struggle with Crohn's disease. Einstein became a humanitarian  not because of his exquisite knowledge of space and time and matter  but because he was a Jew as Germany grew fascist. And Karen Armstrong  I think you would also say that it was some of your very wounding experiences in a religious life that  with a zigzag  have led to the Charter for Compassion. Compassion can't be reduced to sainthood any more than it can be reduced to pity. So I want to propose a final definition of compassion    this is Einstein with Paul Robeson by the way    and that would be for us to call compassion a spiritual technology. Now our traditions contain vast wisdom about this  and we need them to mine it for us now. But compassion is also equally at home in the secular as in the religious. So I will paraphrase Einstein in closing and say that humanity  the future of humanity  needs this technology as much as it needs all the others that have now connected us and set before us the terrifying and wondrous possibility of actually becoming one human race. Thank you. I want you to take a look at this baby. What you're drawn to are her eyes and the skin you love to touch. But today I'm going to talk to you about something you can't see    what's going on up in that little brain of hers. The modern tools of neuroscience are demonstrating to us that what's going on up there is nothing short of rocket science. And what we're learning is going to shed some light on what the romantic writers and poets described as the  celestial openness  of the child's mind. What we see here is a mother in India  and she's speaking Koro  which is a newly discovered language. And she's talking to her baby. What this mother    and the     people who speak Koro in the world    understands  is  that  to preserve this language  they need to speak it to the babies. And therein lies a critical puzzle. Why is it that you can't preserve a language by speaking to you and I  to the adults  Well  it's got to do with your brain. What we see here is that language has a critical period for learning. The way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizontal axis. And you'll see on the vertical your skill at acquiring a second language. Babies and children are geniuses until they turn seven  and then there's a systematic decline. After puberty  we fall off the map. No scientists dispute this curve  but laboratories all over the world are trying to figure out why it works this way. Work in my lab is focused on the first critical period in development    and that is the period in which babies try to master which sounds are used in their language. We think  by studying how the sounds are learned  we'll have a model for the rest of language  and perhaps for critical periods that may exist in childhood for social  emotional and cognitive development. So we've been studying the babies using a technique that we're using all over the world and the sounds of all languages. The baby sits on a parent's lap  and we train them to turn their heads when a sound changes    like from  ah  to  ee.  If they do so at the appropriate time  the black box lights up and a panda bear pounds a drum. A six monther adores the task. What have we learned  Well  babies all over the world are what I like to describe as  citizens of the world.  They can discriminate all the sounds of all languages  no matter what country we're testing and what language we're using  and that's remarkable because you and I can't do that. We're culture bound listeners. We can discriminate the sounds of our own language  but not those of foreign languages. So the question arises  when do those citizens of the world turn into the language bound listeners that we are  And the answer  before their first birthdays. What you see here is performance on that head turn task for babies tested in Tokyo and the United States  here in Seattle  as they listened to  ra  and  la     sounds important to English  but not to Japanese. So at six to eight months the babies are totally equivalent. Two months later something incredible occurs. The babies in the United States are getting a lot better  babies in Japan are getting a lot worse  but both of those groups of babies are preparing for exactly the language that they are going to learn. So the question is  what's happening during this critical two month period  This is the critical period for sound development  but what's going on up there  So there are two things going on. The first is that the babies are listening intently to us  and they're taking statistics as they listen to us talk    they're taking statistics. So listen to two mothers speaking motherese    the universal language we use when we talk to kids    first in English and then in Japanese. so pretty and nice. Japanese Mother   Japanese  Patricia Kuhl  During the production of speech  when babies listen  what they're doing is taking statistics on the language that they hear. And those distributions grow. And what we've learned is that babies are sensitive to the statistics  and the statistics of Japanese and English are very  very different. English has a lot of Rs and Ls. The distribution shows. And the distribution of Japanese is totally different  where we see a group of intermediate sounds  which is known as the Japanese  R.  So babies absorb the statistics of the language and it changes their brains  it changes them from the citizens of the world to the culture bound listeners that we are. But we as adults are no longer absorbing those statistics. We're governed by the representations in memory that were formed early in development. So what we're seeing here is changing our models of what the critical period is about. We're arguing from a mathematical standpoint that the learning of language material may slow down when our distributions stabilize. It's raising lots of questions about bilingual people. Bilinguals must keep two sets of statistics in mind at once and flip between them  one after the other  depending on who they're speaking to. So we asked ourselves  can the babies take statistics on a brand new language  And we tested this by exposing American babies who'd never heard a second language to Mandarin for the first time during the critical period. We knew that  when monolinguals were tested in Taipei and Seattle on the Mandarin sounds  they showed the same pattern. Six to eight months  they're totally equivalent. Two months later  something incredible happens. But the Taiwanese babies are getting better  not the American babies. What we did was expose American babies during this period to Mandarin. It was like having Mandarin relatives come and visit for a month and move into your house and talk to the babies for    sessions. Here's what it looked like in the laboratory. PK  So what have we done to their little brains  We had to run a control group to make sure that just coming into the laboratory didn't improve your Mandarin skills. So a group of babies came in and listened to English. And we can see from the graph that exposure to English didn't improve their Mandarin. But look at what happened to the babies exposed to Mandarin for    sessions. They were as good as the babies in Taiwan who'd been listening for    and a half months. What it demonstrated is that babies take statistics on a new language. Whatever you put in front of them  they'll take statistics on. But we wondered what role the human being played in this learning exercise. So we ran another group of babies in which the kids got the same dosage  the same    sessions  but over a television set and another group of babies who had just audio exposure and looked at a teddy bear on the screen. What did we do to their brains  What you see here is the audio result    no learning whatsoever    and the video result    no learning whatsoever. It takes a human being for babies to take their statistics. The social brain is controlling when the babies are taking their statistics. We want to get inside the brain and see this thing happening as babies are in front of televisions  as opposed to in front of human beings. Thankfully  we have a new machine  magnetoencephalography  that allows us to do this. It looks like a hair dryer from Mars. But it's completely safe  completely non invasive and silent. We're looking at millimeter accuracy with regard to spatial and millisecond accuracy using     SQUIDs    these are Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices    to pick up the magnetic fields that change as we do our thinking. We're the first in the world to record babies in an MEG machine while they are learning. So this is little Emma. She's a six monther. And she's listening to various languages in the earphones that are in her ears. You can see  she can move around. We're tracking her head with little pellets in a cap  so she's free to move completely unconstrained. It's a technical tour de force. What are we seeing  We're seeing the baby brain. As the baby hears a word in her language the auditory areas light up  and then subsequently areas surrounding it that we think are related to coherence  getting the brain coordinated with its different areas  and causality  one brain area causing another to activate. We are embarking on a grand and golden age of knowledge about child's brain development. We're going to be able to see a child's brain as they experience an emotion  as they learn to speak and read  as they solve a math problem  as they have an idea. And we're going to be able to invent brain based interventions for children who have difficulty learning. Just as the poets and writers described  we're going to be able to see  I think  that wondrous openness  utter and complete openness  of the mind of a child. In investigating the child's brain  we're going to uncover deep truths about what it means to be human  and in the process  we may be able to help keep our own minds open to learning for our entire lives. Thank you. I've been spending a lot of time traveling around the world these days  talking to groups of students and professionals  and everywhere I'm finding that I hear similar themes. On the one hand  people say   The time for change is now.  They want to be part of it. They talk about wanting lives of purpose and greater meaning. But on the other hand  I hear people talking about fear  a sense of risk aversion. They say   I really want to follow a life of purpose  but I don't know where to start. I don't want to disappoint my family or friends.  I work in global poverty. And they say   I want to work in global poverty  but what will it mean about my career  Will I be marginalized  Will I not make enough money  Will I never get married or have children   And as a woman who didn't get married until I was a lot older    and I'm glad I waited       and has no children  I look at these young people and I say   Your job is not to be perfect. Your job is only to be human. And nothing important happens in life without a cost.  These conversations really reflect what's happening at the national and international level. Our leaders and ourselves want everything  but we don't talk about the costs. We don't talk about the sacrifice. One of my favorite quotes from literature was written by Tillie Olsen  the great American writer from the South. In a short story called  Oh Yes   she talks about a white woman in the     s who has a daughter who befriends a little African American girl  and she looks at her child with a sense of pride  but she also wonders  what price will she pay   Better immersion than to live untouched.  But the real question is  what is the cost of not daring  What is the cost of not trying  I've been so privileged in my life to know extraordinary leaders who have chosen to live lives of immersion. One woman I knew who was a fellow at a program that I ran at the Rockefeller Foundation was named Ingrid Washinawatok. She was a leader of the Menominee tribe  a Native American peoples. And when we would gather as fellows  she would push us to think about how the elders in Native American culture make decisions. And she said they would literally visualize the faces of children for seven generations into the future  looking at them from the Earth  and they would look at them  holding them as stewards for that future. Ingrid understood that we are connected to each other  not only as human beings  but to every living thing on the planet. And tragically  in       when she was in Colombia working with the U'wa people  focused on preserving their culture and language  she and two colleagues were abducted and tortured and killed by the FARC. And whenever we would gather the fellows after that  we would leave a chair empty for her spirit. And more than a decade later  when I talk to NGO fellows  whether in Trenton  New Jersey or the office of the White House  and we talk about Ingrid  they all say that they're trying to integrate her wisdom and her spirit and really build on the unfulfilled work of her life's mission. And when we think about legacy  I can think of no more powerful one  despite how short her life was. And I've been touched by Cambodian women    beautiful women  women who held the tradition of the classical dance in Cambodia. And I met them in the early '  s. In the     s  under the Pol Pot regime  the Khmer Rouge killed over a million people  and they focused and targeted the elites and the intellectuals  the artists  the dancers. And at the end of the war  there were only    of these classical dancers still living. And the women  who I was so privileged to meet when there were three survivors  told these stories about lying in their cots in the refugee camps. They said they would try so hard to remember the fragments of the dance  hoping that others were alive and doing the same. And one woman stood there with this perfect carriage  her hands at her side  and she talked about the reunion of the    after the war and how extraordinary it was. And these big tears fell down her face  but she never lifted her hands to move them. And the women decided that they would train not the next generation of girls  because they had grown too old already  but the next generation. And I sat there in the studio watching these women clapping their hands    beautiful rhythms    as these little fairy pixies were dancing around them  wearing these beautiful silk colors. And I thought  after all this atrocity  this is how human beings really pray. Because they're focused on honoring what is most beautiful about our past and building it into the promise of our future. And what these women understood is sometimes the most important things that we do and that we spend our time on are those things that we cannot measure. I also have been touched by the dark side of power and leadership. And I have learned that power  particularly in its absolute form  is an equal opportunity provider. In       I moved to Rwanda  and I worked with a very small group of Rwandan women to start that country's first microfinance bank. And one of the women was Agnes    there on your extreme left    she was one of the first three women parliamentarians in Rwanda  and her legacy should have been to be one of the mothers of Rwanda. We built this institution based on social justice  gender equity  this idea of empowering women. But Agnes cared more about the trappings of power than she did principle at the end. And though she had been part of building a liberal party  a political party that was focused on diversity and tolerance  about three months before the genocide  she switched parties and joined the extremist party  Hutu Power  and she became the Minister of Justice under the genocide regime and was known for inciting men to kill faster and stop behaving like women. She was convicted of category one crimes of genocide. And I would visit her in the prisons  sitting side by side  knees touching  and I would have to admit to myself that monsters exist in all of us  but that maybe it's not monsters so much  but the broken parts of ourselves  sadnesses  secret shame  and that ultimately it's easy for demagogues to prey on those parts  those fragments  if you will  and to make us look at other beings  human beings  as lesser than ourselves    and in the extreme  to do terrible things. And there is no group more vulnerable to those kinds of manipulations than young men. I've heard it said that the most dangerous animal on the planet is the adolescent male. And so in a gathering where we're focused on women  while it is so critical that we invest in our girls and we even the playing field and we find ways to honor them  we have to remember that the girls and the women are most isolated and violated and victimized and made invisible in those very societies where our men and our boys feel disempowered  unable to provide. And that  when they sit on those street corners and all they can think of in the future is no job  no education  no possibility  well then it's easy to understand how the greatest source of status can come from a uniform and a gun. Sometimes very small investments can release enormous  infinite potential that exists in all of us. One of the Acumen Fund fellows at my organization  Suraj Sudhakar  has what we call moral imagination    the ability to put yourself in another person's shoes and lead from that perspective. And he's been working with this young group of men who come from the largest slum in the world  Kibera. And they're incredible guys. And together they started a book club for a hundred people in the slums  and they're reading many TED authors and liking it. And then they created a business plan competition. Then they decided that they would do TEDx's. And I have learned so much from Chris and Kevin and Alex and Herbert and all of these young men. Alex  in some ways  said it best. He said   We used to feel like nobodies  but now we feel like somebodies.  And I think we have it all wrong when we think that income is the link. What we really yearn for as human beings is to be visible to each other. And the reason these young guys told me that they're doing these TEDx's is because they were sick and tired of the only workshops coming to the slums being those workshops focused on HIV  or at best  microfinance. And they wanted to celebrate what's beautiful about Kibera and Mathare    the photojournalists and the creatives  the graffiti artists  the teachers and the entrepreneurs. And they're doing it. And my hat's off to you in Kibera. My own work focuses on making philanthropy more effective and capitalism more inclusive. At Acumen Fund  we take philanthropic resources and we invest what we call patient capital    money that will invest in entrepreneurs who see the poor not as passive recipients of charity  but as full bodied agents of change who want to solve their own problems and make their own decisions. We leave our money for    to    years  and when we get it back  we invest in other innovations that focus on change. I know it works. We've invested more than    million dollars in    companies  and those companies have brought another     million dollars into these forgotten markets. This year alone  they've delivered    million services like maternal health care and housing  emergency services  solar energy  so that people can have more dignity in solving their problems. Patient capital is uncomfortable for people searching for simple solutions  easy categories  because we don't see profit as a blunt instrument. But we find those entrepreneurs who put people and the planet before profit. And ultimately  we want to be part of a movement that is about measuring impact  measuring what is most important to us. And my dream is we'll have a world one day where we don't just honor those who take money and make more money from it  but we find those individuals who take our resources and convert it into changing the world in the most positive ways. And it's only when we honor them and celebrate them and give them status that the world will really change. Last May I had this extraordinary    hour period where I saw two visions of the world living side by side    one based on violence and the other on transcendence. I happened to be in Lahore  Pakistan on the day that two mosques were attacked by suicide bombers. And the reason these mosques were attacked is because the people praying inside were from a particular sect of Islam who fundamentalists don't believe are fully Muslim. And not only did those suicide bombers take a hundred lives  but they did more  because they created more hatred  more rage  more fear and certainly despair. But less than    hours  I was    miles away from those mosques  visiting one of our Acumen investees  an incredible man  Jawad Aslam  who dares to live a life of immersion. Born and raised in Baltimore  he studied real estate  worked in commercial real estate  and after      decided he was going to Pakistan to make a difference. For two years  he hardly made any money  a tiny stipend  but he apprenticed with this incredible housing developer named Tasneem Saddiqui. And he had a dream that he would build a housing community on this barren piece of land using patient capital  but he continued to pay a price. He stood on moral ground and refused to pay bribes. It took almost two years just to register the land. But I saw how the level of moral standard can rise from one person's action. Today        people live in     houses in this beautiful community. And there's schools and clinics and shops. But there's only one mosque. And so I asked Jawad   How do you guys navigate  This is a really diverse community. Who gets to use the mosque on Fridays   He said   Long story. It was hard  it was a difficult road  but ultimately the leaders of the community came together  realizing we only have each other. And we decided that we would elect the three most respected imams  and those imams would take turns  they would rotate who would say Friday prayer. But the whole community  all the different sects  including Shi'a and Sunni  would sit together and pray.  We need that kind of moral leadership and courage in our worlds. We face huge issues as a world    the financial crisis  global warming and this growing sense of fear and otherness. And every day we have a choice. We can take the easier road  the more cynical road  which is a road based on sometimes dreams of a past that never really was  a fear of each other  distancing and blame. Or we can take the much more difficult path of transformation  transcendence  compassion and love  but also accountability and justice. I had the great honor of working with the child psychologist Dr. Robert Coles  who stood up for change during the Civil Rights movement in the United States. And he tells this incredible story about working with a little six year old girl named Ruby Bridges  the first child to desegregate schools in the South    in this case  New Orleans. And he said that every day this six year old  dressed in her beautiful dress  would walk with real grace through a phalanx of white people screaming angrily  calling her a monster  threatening to poison her    distorted faces. And every day he would watch her  and it looked like she was talking to the people. And he would say   Ruby  what are you saying   And she'd say   I'm not talking.  And finally he said   Ruby  I see that you're talking. What are you saying   And she said   Dr. Coles  I am not talking  I'm praying.  And he said   Well  what are you praying   And she said   I'm praying  'Father  forgive them  for they know not what they are doing.'  At age six  this child was living a life of immersion  and her family paid a price for it. But she became part of history and opened up this idea that all of us should have access to education. My final story is about a young  beautiful man named Josephat Byaruhanga  who was another Acumen Fund fellow  who hails from Uganda  a farming community. And we placed him in a company in Western Kenya  just     miles away. And he said to me at the end of his year   Jacqueline  it was so humbling  because I thought as a farmer and as an African I would understand how to transcend culture. But especially when I was talking to the African women  I sometimes made these mistakes    it was so hard for me to learn how to listen.  And he said   So I conclude that  in many ways  leadership is like a panicle of rice. Because at the height of the season  at the height of its powers  it's beautiful  it's green  it nourishes the world  it reaches to the heavens.  And he said   But right before the harvest  it bends over with great gratitude and humility to touch the earth from where it came.  We need leaders. We ourselves need to lead from a place that has the audacity to believe we can  ourselves  extend the fundamental assumption that all men are created equal to every man  woman and child on this planet. And we need to have the humility to recognize that we cannot do it alone. Robert Kennedy once said that  few of us have the greatness to bend history itself  but each of us can work to change a small portion of events.  And it is in the total of all those acts that the history of this generation will be written. Our lives are so short  and our time on this planet is so precious  and all we have is each other. So may each of you live lives of immersion. They won't necessarily be easy lives  but in the end  it is all that will sustain us. Thank you. I'm speaking to you about what I call the  mesh.  It's essentially a fundamental shift in our relationship with stuff  with the things in our lives. And it's starting to look at    not always and not for everything    but in certain moments of time  access to certain kinds of goods and service will trump ownership of them. And so it's the pursuit of better things  easily shared. And we come from a long tradition of sharing. We've shared transportation. We've shared wine and food and other sorts of fabulous experiences in coffee bars in Amsterdam. We've also shared other sorts of entertainment    sports arenas  public parks  concert halls  libraries  universities. All these things are share platforms  but sharing ultimately starts and ends with what I refer to as the  mother of all share platforms.  And as I think about the mesh and I think about  well  what's driving it  how come it's happening now  I think there's a number of vectors that I want to give you as background. One is the recession    that the recession has caused us to rethink our relationship with the things in our lives relative to the value    so starting to align the value with the true cost. Secondly  population growth and density into cities. More people  smaller spaces  less stuff. Climate change  we're trying to reduce the stress in our personal lives and in our communities and on the planet. Also  there's been this recent distrust of big brands  global big brands  in a bunch of different industries  and that's created an opening. Research is showing here  in the States  and in Canada and Western Europe  that most of us are much more open to local companies  or brands that maybe we haven't heard of. Whereas before  we went with the big brands that we were sure we trusted. And last is that we're more connected now to more people on the planet than ever before    except for if you're sitting next to someone. The other thing that's worth considering is that we've made a huge investment over decades and decades  and tens of billions of dollars have gone into this investment that now is our inheritance. It's a physical infrastructure that allows us to get from point A to point B and move things that way. It's also    Web and mobile allow us to be connected and create all kinds of platforms and systems  and the investment of those technologies and that infrastructure is really our inheritance. It allows us to engage in really new and interesting ways. And so for me  a mesh company  the  classic  mesh company  brings together these three things  our ability to connect to each other    most of us are walking around with these mobile devices that are GPS enabled and Web enabled    allows us to find each other and find things in time and space. And third is that physical things are readable on a map    so restaurants  a variety of venues  but also with GPS and other technology like RFID and it continues to expand beyond that  we can also track things that are moving  like a car  a taxicab  a transit system  a box that's moving through time and space. And so that sets up for making access to get goods and services more convenient and less costly in many cases than owning them. For example  I want to use Zipcar. How many people here have experienced car sharing or bike sharing  Wow  that's great. Okay  thank you. Basically Zipcar is the largest car sharing company in the world. They did not invent car sharing. Car sharing was actually invented in Europe. One of the founders went to Switzerland  saw it implemented someplace  said   Wow  that looks really cool. I think we can do that in Cambridge   brought it to Cambridge and they started    two women    Robin Chase being the other person who started it. Zipcar got some really important things right. First  they really understood that a brand is a voice and a product is a souvenir. And so they were very clever about the way that they packaged car sharing. They made it sexy. They made it fresh. They made it aspirational. If you were a member of the club  when you're a member of a club  you're a Zipster. The cars they picked didn't look like ex cop cars that were hollowed out or something. They picked these sexy cars. They targeted to universities. They made sure that the demographic for who they were targeting and the car was all matching. It was a very nice experience  and the cars were clean and reliable  and it all worked. And so from a branding perspective  they got a lot right. But they understood fundamentally that they are not a car company. They understand that they are an information company. Because when we buy a car we go to the dealer once  we have an interaction  and we're chow    usually as quickly as possible. But when you're sharing a car and you have a car share service  you might use an E.V. to commute  you get a truck because you're doing a home project. When you pick your aunt up at the airport  you get a sedan. And you're going to the mountains to ski  you get different accessories put on the car for doing that sort of thing. Meanwhile  these guys are sitting back  collecting all sorts of data about our behavior and how we interact with the service. And so it's not only an option for them  but I believe it's an imperative for Zipcar and other mesh companies to actually just wow us  to be like a concierge service. Because we give them so much information  and they are entitled to really see how it is that we're moving. They're in really good shape to anticipate what we're going to want next. And so what percent of the day do you think the average person uses a car  What percentage of the time  Any guesses  Those are really very good. I was imagining it was like    percent when I first started. The number across the U.S. and Western Europe is eight percent. And so basically even if you think it's    percent     percent of the time  something that costs us a lot of money    personally  and also we organize our cities around it and all sorts of things       percent of the time it's sitting around. So for this reason  I think one of the other themes with the mesh is essentially that  if we squeeze hard on things that we've thrown away  there's a lot of value in those things. What set up with Zipcar    Zipcar started in     . In the last year        two car companies started  one that's in the U.K. called WhipCar  and the other one  RelayRides  in the U.S. They're both peer to peer car sharing services  because the two things that really work for car sharing is  one  the car has to be available  and two  it's within one or two blocks of where you stand. Well the car that's one or two blocks from your home or your office is probably your neighbor's car  and it's probably also available. So people have created this business. Zipcar started a decade earlier  in     . It took them six years to get       cars in service. WhipCar  which started April of last year  it took them six months to get       cars in the service. So  really interesting. People are making anywhere between     and     dollars a month letting their neighbors use their car when they're not using it. So it's like vacation rentals for cars. Since I'm here    and I hope some people in the audience are in the car business       I'm thinking that  coming from the technology side of things    we saw cable ready TVs and WiFi ready Notebooks    it would be really great if  any minute now  you guys could start rolling share ready cars off. Because it just creates more flexibility. It allows us as owners to have other options. And I think we're going there anyway. The opportunity and the challenge with mesh businesses    and those are businesses like Zipcar or Netflix that are full mesh businesses  or other ones where you have a lot of the car companies  car manufacturers  who are beginning to offer their own car share services as well as a second flanker brand  or as really a test  I think    is to make sharing irresistible. We have experiences in our lives  certainly  when sharing has been irresistible. It's just  how do we make that recurrent and scale it  We know also  because we're connected in social networks  that it's easy to create delight in one little place. It's contagious because we're all connected to each other. So if I have a terrific experience and I tweet it  or I tell five people standing next to me  news travels. The opposite  as we know  is also true  often more true. So here we have LudoTruck  which is in L.A.  doing the things that gourmet food trucks do  and they've gathered quite a following. In general  and maybe  again  it's because I'm a tech entrepreneur  I look at things as platforms. Platforms are invitations. So creating Craigslist or iTunes and the iPhone developer network  there are all these networks    Facebook as well. These platforms invite all sorts of developers and all sorts of people to come with their ideas and their opportunity to create and target an application for a particular audience. And honestly  it's full of surprises. Because I don't think any of us in this room could have predicted the sorts of applications that have happened at Facebook  around Facebook  for example  two years ago  when Mark announced that they were going to go with a platform. So in this way  I think that cities are platforms  and certainly Detroit is a platform. The invitation of bringing makers and artists and entrepreneurs    it really helps stimulate this fiery creativity and helps a city to thrive. It's inviting participation  and cities have  historically  invited all sorts of participation. Now we're saying that there's other options as well. So  for example  city departments can open up transit data. Google has made available transit data API. And so there's about seven or eight cities already in the U.S. that have provided the transit data  and different developers are building applications. So I was having a coffee in Portland  and half of a latte in and the little board in the cafe all of a sudden starts showing me that the next bus is coming in three minutes and the train is coming in    minutes. And so it's reliable  real data that's right in my face  where I am  so I can finish the latte. There's this fabulous opportunity we have across the U.S. now  about    percent of vacant commercial and industrial space. That space is not vital. The areas around it lack vitality and vibrancy and engagement. There's this thing    how many people here have heard of pop up stores or pop up shops  Oh  great. So I'm a big fan of this. And this is a very mesh y thing. Essentially  there are all sorts of restaurants in Oakland  near where I live. There's a pop up general store every three weeks  and they do a fantastic job of making a very social event happening for foodies. Super fun  and it happens in a very transitional neighborhood. Subsequent to that  after it's been going for about a year now  they actually started to lease and create and extend. An area that was edgy artsy is now starting to become much cooler and engage a lot more people. So this is an example. The Crafty Fox is this woman who's into crafts  and she does these pop up crafts fairs around London. But these sorts of things are happening in many different environments. From my perspective  one of the things pop up stores do is create perishability and urgency. It creates two of the favorite words of any businessperson  sold out. And the opportunity to really focus trust and attention is a wonderful thing. So a lot of what we see in the mesh  and a lot of what we have in the platform that we built allows us to define  refine and scale. It allows us to test things as an entrepreneur  to go to market  to be in conversation with people  listen  refine something and go back. It's very cost effective  and it's very mesh y. The infrastructure enables that. In closing  and as we're moving towards the end  I just also want to encourage    and I'm willing to share my failures as well  though not from the stage. I would just like to say that one of the big things  when we look at waste and when we look at ways that we can really be generous and contribute to each other  but also move to create a better economic situation and a better environmental situation  is by sharing failures. And one quick example is Velib  in       came forward in Paris with a very bold proposition  a very big bike sharing service. They made a lot of mistakes. They had some number of big successes. But they were very transparent  or they had to be  in the way that they exposed what worked and didn't work. And so B.C. in Barcelona and B cycle and Boris Bikes in London    no one has had to repeat the version  .  screw ups and expensive learning exercises that happened in Paris. So the opportunity when we're connected is also to share failures and successes. We're at the very beginning of something that  what we're seeing and the way that mesh companies are coming forward  is inviting  it's engaging  but it's very early. I have a website    it's a directory    and it started with about       companies  and in the last two and a half months it's up to about       companies. And it grows on a very regular daily basis. But it's very much at the beginning. So I just want to welcome all of you onto the ride. And thank you very much. Pat Mitchell  What is the story of this pin  Madeleine Albright  This is  Breaking the Glass Ceiling.  PM  Oh. That was well chosen  I would say  for TEDWomen. MA  Most of the time I spend when I get up in the morning is trying to figure out what is going to happen. And none of this pin stuff would have happened if it hadn't been for Saddam Hussein. I'll tell you what happened. I went to the United Nations as an ambassador  and it was after the Gulf War  and I was an instructed ambassador. And the cease fire had been translated into a series of sanctions resolutions  and my instructions were to say perfectly terrible things about Saddam Hussein constantly  which he deserved    he had invaded another country. And so all of a sudden  a poem appeared in the papers in Baghdad comparing me to many things  but among them an  unparalleled serpent.  And so I happened to have a snake pin. So I wore it when we talked about Iraq. And when I went out to meet the press  they zeroed in  said   Why are you wearing that snake pin   I said   Because Saddam Hussein compared me to an unparalleled serpent.  And then I thought  well this is fun. So I went out and I bought a lot of pins that would  in fact  reflect what I thought we were going to do on any given day. So that's how it all started. PM  So how large is the collection  MA  Pretty big. It's now traveling. At the moment it's in Indianapolis  but it was at the Smithsonian. And it goes with a book that says   Read My Pins.  PM  So is this a good idea. I remember when you were the first woman as Secretary of State  and there was a lot of conversation always about what you were wearing  how you looked    the thing that happens to a lot of women  especially if they're the first in a position. So how do you feel about that    the whole    MA  Well  it's pretty irritating actually because nobody ever describes what a man is wearing. But people did pay attention to what clothes I had. What was interesting was that  before I went up to New York as U.N. ambassador  I talked to Jeane Kirkpatrick  who'd been ambassador before me  and she said   You've got to get rid of your professor clothes. Go out and look like a diplomat.  So that did give me a lot of opportunities to go shopping. But still  there were all kinds of questions about     did you wear a hat    How short was your skirt   And one of the things    if you remember Condoleezza Rice was at some event and she wore boots  and she got criticized over that. And no guy ever gets criticized. But that's the least of it. PM  It is  for all of us  men and women  finding our ways of defining our roles  and doing them in ways that make a difference in the world and shape the future. How did you handle that balance between being the tough diplomatic and strong voice of this country to the rest of the world and also how you felt about yourself as a mother  a grandmother  nurturing ... and so how did you handle that  MA  Well the interesting part was I was asked what it was like to be the first woman Secretary of State a few minutes after I'd been named. And I said   Well I've been a woman for    years  but I've only been Secretary of State for a few minutes.  So it evolved. But basically I love being a woman. And so what happened    and I think there will probably be some people in the audience that will identify with this    I went to my first meeting  first at the U.N.  and that's when this all started  because that is a very male organization. And I'm sitting there    there are    members of the Security Council    so    men sat there staring at me  and I thought    well you know how we all are. You want to get the feeling of the room  and  do people like me   and  will I really say something intelligent   And all of a sudden I thought   Well  wait a minute. I am sitting behind a sign that says 'The United States ' and if I don't speak today then the voice of the United States will not be heard   and it was the first time that I had that feeling that I had to step out of myself in my normal  reluctant female mode and decide that I had to speak on behalf of our country. And so that happened more at various times  but I really think that there was a great advantage in many ways to being a woman. I think we are a lot better at personal relationships  and then have the capability obviously of telling it like it is when it's necessary. But I have to tell you  I have my youngest granddaughter  when she turned seven last year  said to her mother  my daughter   So what's the big deal about Grandma Maddie being Secretary of State  Only girls are Secretary of State.  PM  Because in her lifetime    MA  That would be so. PM  What a change that is. As you travel now all over the world  which you do frequently  how do you assess this global narrative around the story of women and girls  Where are we  MA  I think we're slowly changing  but obviously there are whole pockets in countries where nothing is different. And therefore it means that we have to remember that  while many of us have had huge opportunities    and Pat  you have been a real leader in your field    is that there are a lot of women that are not capable of worrying and taking care of themselves and understanding that women have to help other women. And so what I have felt    and I have looked at this from a national security issue    when I was Secretary of State  I decided that women's issues had to be central to American foreign policy  not just because I'm a feminist  but because I believe that societies are better off when women are politically and economically empowered  that values are passed down  the health situation is better  education is better  there is greater economic prosperity. So I think that it behooves us    those of us that live in various countries where we do have economic and political voice    that we need to help other women. And I really dedicated myself to that  both at the U.N. and then as Secretary of State. PM  And did you get pushback from making that a central tenant of foreign policy  MA  From some people. I think that they thought that it was a soft issue. The bottom line that I decided was actually women's issues are the hardest issues  because they are the ones that have to do with life and death in so many aspects  and because  as I said  it is really central to the way that we think about things. Now for instance  some of the wars that took place when I was in office  a lot of them  the women were the main victims of it. For instance  when I started  there were wars in the Balkans. The women in Bosnia were being raped. We then managed to set up a war crimes tribunal to deal specifically with those kinds of issues. And by the way  one of the things that I did at that stage was  I had just arrived at the U.N.  and when I was there  there were     countries in the U.N. Now there are    . But it was one of the first times that I didn't have to cook lunch myself. So I said to my assistant   Invite the other women permanent representatives.  And I thought when I'd get to my apartment that there'd be a lot of women there. I get there  and there are six other women  out of    . So the countries that had women representatives were Canada  Kazakhstan  Philippines  Trinidad Tobago  Jamaica  Lichtenstein and me. So being an American  I decided to set up a caucus. And so we set it up  and we called ourselves the G . PM  Is that  Girl     MA  Girl  . And we lobbied on behalf of women's issues. So we managed to get two women judges on this war crimes tribunal. And then what happened was that they were able to declare that rape was a weapon of war  that it was against humanity. PM  So when you look around the world and you see that  in many cases    certainly in the Western world    women are evolving into more leadership positions  and even other places some barriers are being brought down  but there's still so much violence  still so many problems  and yet we hear there are more women at the negotiating tables. Now you were at those negotiating tables when they weren't  when there was maybe you    one voice  maybe one or two others. Do you believe  and can you tell us why  there is going to be a significant shift in things like violence and peace and conflict and resolution on a sustainable basis  MA  Well I do think  when there are more women  that the tone of the conversation changes  and also the goals of the conversation change. But it doesn't mean that the whole world would be a lot better if it were totally run by women. If you think that  you've forgotten high school. But the bottom line is that there is a way  when there are more women at the table  that there's an attempt to develop some understanding. So for instance  what I did when I went to Burundi  we'd got Tutsi and Hutu women together to talk about some of the problems that had taken place in Rwanda. And so I think the capability of women to put themselves    I think we're better about putting ourselves into the other guy's shoes and having more empathy. I think it helps in terms of the support if there are other women in the room. When I was Secretary of State  there were only    other women foreign ministers. And so it was nice when one of them would show up. For instance  she is now the president of Finland  but Tarja Halonen was the foreign minister of Finland and  at a certain stage  head of the European Union. And it was really terrific. Because one of the things I think you'll understand. We went to a meeting  and the men in my delegation  when I would say   Well I feel we should do something about this   and they'd say   What do you mean  you feel   And so then Tarja was sitting across the table from me. And all of a sudden we were talking about arms control  and she said   Well I feel we should do this.  And my male colleagues kind of got it all of a sudden. But I think it really does help to have a critical mass of women in a series of foreign policy positions. The other thing that I think is really important  A lot of national security policy isn't just about foreign policy  but it's about budgets  military budgets  and how the debts of countries work out. So if you have women in a variety of foreign policy posts  they can support each other when there are budget decisions being made in their own countries. PM  So how do we get this balance we're looking for  then  in the world  More women's voices at the table  More men who believe that the balance is best  MA  Well I think one of the things    I'm chairman of the board of an organization called the National Democratic Institute that works to support women candidates. I think that we need to help in other countries to train women to be in political office  to figure out how they can in fact develop political voices. I think we also need to be supportive when businesses are being created and just make sure that women help each other. Now I have a saying that I feel very strongly about  because I am of a certain age where  when I started in my career  believe it or not  there were other women who criticized me   Why aren't you in the carpool line   or  Aren't your children suffering because you're not there all the time   And I think we have a tendency to make each other feel guilty. In fact  I think  guilt  is every woman's middle name. And so I think what needs to happen is we need to help each other. And my motto is that there's a special place in hell for women who don't help each other. PM  Well Secretary Albright  I guess you'll be going to heaven. Thank you for joining us today. MA  Thank you all. Thanks Pat. It's Monday morning. In Washington  the president of the United States is sitting in the Oval Office  assessing whether or not to strike Al Qaeda in Yemen. At Number    Downing Street  David Cameron is trying to work out whether to cut more public sector jobs in order to stave off a double dip recession. In Madrid  Maria Gonzalez is standing at the door  listening to her baby crying and crying  trying to work out whether she should let it cry until it falls asleep or pick it up and hold it. And I am sitting by my father's bedside in hospital  trying to work out whether I should let him drink the one and a half liter bottle of water that his doctors just came in and said   You must make him drink today      my father's been nil by mouth for a week    or whether  by giving him this bottle  I might actually kill him. We face momentous decisions with important consequences throughout our lives  and we have strategies for dealing with these decisions. We talk things over with our friends  we scour the Internet  we search through books. But still  even in this age of Google and TripAdvisor and Amazon Recommends  it's still experts that we rely upon most    especially when the stakes are high and the decision really matters. Because in a world of data deluge and extreme complexity  we believe that experts are more able to process information than we can    that they are able to come to better conclusions than we could come to on our own. And in an age that is sometimes nowadays frightening or confusing  we feel reassured by the almost parental like authority of experts who tell us so clearly what it is we can and cannot do. But I believe that this is a big problem  a problem with potentially dangerous consequences for us as a society  as a culture and as individuals. It's not that experts have not massively contributed to the world    of course they have. The problem lies with us  we've become addicted to experts. We've become addicted to their certainty  their assuredness  their definitiveness  and in the process  we have ceded our responsibility  substituting our intellect and our intelligence for their supposed words of wisdom. We've surrendered our power  trading off our discomfort with uncertainty for the illusion of certainty that they provide. This is no exaggeration. In a recent experiment  a group of adults had their brains scanned in an MRI machine as they were listening to experts speak. The results were quite extraordinary. As they listened to the experts' voices  the independent decision making parts of their brains switched off. It literally flat lined. And they listened to whatever the experts said and took their advice  however right or wrong. But experts do get things wrong. Did you know that studies show that doctors misdiagnose four times out of     Did you know that if you file your tax returns yourself  you're statistically more likely to be filing them correctly than if you get a tax adviser to do it for you  And then there's  of course  the example that we're all too aware of  financial experts getting it so wrong that we're living through the worst recession since the     s. For the sake of our health  our wealth and our collective security  it's imperative that we keep the independent decision making parts of our brains switched on. And I'm saying this as an economist who  over the past few years  has focused my research on what it is we think and who it is we trust and why  but also    and I'm aware of the irony here    as an expert myself  as a professor  as somebody who advises prime ministers  heads of big companies  international organizations  but an expert who believes that the role of experts needs to change  that we need to become more open minded  more democratic and be more open to people rebelling against our points of view. So in order to help you understand where I'm coming from  let me bring you into my world  the world of experts. Now there are  of course  exceptions  wonderful  civilization enhancing exceptions. But what my research has shown me is that experts tend on the whole to form very rigid camps  that within these camps  a dominant perspective emerges that often silences opposition  that experts move with the prevailing winds  often hero worshipping their own gurus. Alan Greenspan's proclamations that the years of economic growth would go on and on  not challenged by his peers  until after the crisis  of course. You see  we also learn that experts are located  are governed  by the social and cultural norms of their times    whether it be the doctors in Victorian England  say  who sent women to asylums for expressing sexual desire  or the psychiatrists in the United States who  up until       were still categorizing homosexuality as a mental illness. And what all this means is that paradigms take far too long to shift  that complexity and nuance are ignored and also that money talks    because we've all seen the evidence of pharmaceutical companies funding studies of drugs that conveniently leave out their worst side effects  or studies funded by food companies of their new products  massively exaggerating the health benefits of the products they're about to bring by market. The study showed that food companies exaggerated typically seven times more than an independent study. And we've also got to be aware that experts  of course  also make mistakes. They make mistakes every single day    mistakes born out of carelessness. A recent study in the Archives of Surgery reported surgeons removing healthy ovaries  operating on the wrong side of the brain  carrying out procedures on the wrong hand  elbow  eye  foot  and also mistakes born out of thinking errors. A common thinking error of radiologists  for example    when they look at CT scans    is that they're overly influenced by whatever it is that the referring physician has said that he suspects the patient's problem to be. So if a radiologist is looking at the scan of a patient with suspected pneumonia  say  what happens is that  if they see evidence of pneumonia on the scan  they literally stop looking at it    thereby missing the tumor sitting three inches below on the patient's lungs. I've shared with you so far some insights into the world of experts. These are  of course  not the only insights I could share  but I hope they give you a clear sense at least of why we need to stop kowtowing to them  why we need to rebel and why we need to switch our independent decision making capabilities on. But how can we do this  Well for the sake of time  I want to focus on just three strategies. First  we've got to be ready and willing to take experts on and dispense with this notion of them as modern day apostles. This doesn't mean having to get a Ph.D. in every single subject  you'll be relieved to hear. But it does mean persisting in the face of their inevitable annoyance when  for example  we want them to explain things to us in language that we can actually understand. Why was it that  when I had an operation  my doctor said to me   Beware  Ms. Hertz  of hyperpyrexia   when he could have just as easily said   Watch out for a high fever.  You see  being ready to take experts on is about also being willing to dig behind their graphs  their equations  their forecasts  their prophecies  and being armed with the questions to do that    questions like  What are the assumptions that underpin this  What is the evidence upon which this is based  What has your investigation focused on  And what has it ignored  It recently came out that experts trialing drugs before they come to market typically trial drugs first  primarily on male animals and then  primarily on men. It seems that they've somehow overlooked the fact that over half the world's population are women. And women have drawn the short medical straw because it now turns out that many of these drugs don't work nearly as well on women as they do on men    and the drugs that do work well work so well that they're actively harmful for women to take. Being a rebel is about recognizing that experts' assumptions and their methodologies can easily be flawed. Second  we need to create the space for what I call  managed dissent.  If we are to shift paradigms  if we are to make breakthroughs  if we are to destroy myths  we need to create an environment in which expert ideas are battling it out  in which we're bringing in new  diverse  discordant  heretical views into the discussion  fearlessly  in the knowledge that progress comes about  not only from the creation of ideas  but also from their destruction    and also from the knowledge that  by surrounding ourselves by divergent  discordant  heretical views. All the research now shows us that this actually makes us smarter. Encouraging dissent is a rebellious notion because it goes against our very instincts  which are to surround ourselves with opinions and advice that we already believe or want to be true. And that's why I talk about the need to actively manage dissent. Google CEO Eric Schmidt is a practical practitioner of this philosophy. In meetings  he looks out for the person in the room    arms crossed  looking a bit bemused    and draws them into the discussion  trying to see if they indeed are the person with a different opinion  so that they have dissent within the room. Managing dissent is about recognizing the value of disagreement  discord and difference. But we need to go even further. We need to fundamentally redefine who it is that experts are. The conventional notion is that experts are people with advanced degrees  fancy titles  diplomas  best selling books    high status individuals. But just imagine if we were to junk this notion of expertise as some sort of elite cadre and instead embrace the notion of democratized expertise    whereby expertise was not just the preserve of surgeons and CEO's  but also shop girls    yeah. Best Buy  the consumer electronics company  gets all its employees    the cleaners  the shop assistants  the people in the back office  not just its forecasting team    to place bets  yes bets  on things like whether or not a product is going to sell well before Christmas  on whether customers' new ideas are going to be or should be taken on by the company  on whether a project will come in on time. By leveraging and by embracing the expertise within the company  Best Buy was able to discover  for example  that the store that it was going to open in China    its big  grand store    was not going to open on time. Because when it asked its staff  all its staff  to place their bets on whether they thought the store would open on time or not  a group from the finance department placed all their chips on that not happening. It turned out that they were aware  as no one else within the company was  of a technological blip that neither the forecasting experts  nor the experts on the ground in China  were even aware of. The strategies that I have discussed this evening    embracing dissent  taking experts on  democratizing expertise  rebellious strategies    are strategies that I think would serve us all well to embrace as we try to deal with the challenges of these very confusing  complex  difficult times. For if we keep our independent decision making part of our brains switched on  if we challenge experts  if we're skeptical  if we devolve authority  if we are rebellious  but also if we become much more comfortable with nuance  uncertainty and doubt  and if we allow our experts to express themselves using those terms too  we will set ourselves up much better for the challenges of the   st century. For now  more than ever  is not the time to be blindly following  blindly accepting  blindly trusting. Now is the time to face the world with eyes wide open    yes  using experts to help us figure things out  for sure    I don't want to completely do myself out of a job here    but being aware of their limitations and  of course  also our own. Thank you. Our face is hugely important because it's the external  visual part that everybody else sees. Let's not forget it's a functional entity. We have strong skull bones that protect the most important organ in our body  the brain. It's where our senses are located  our special senses    our vision  our speech  our hearing  our smell  our taste. And this bone is peppered  as you can see  with the light shining through the skull with cavities  the sinuses  which warm and moisten the air we breathe. But also imagine if they were filled with solid bone    our head would be dead weight  we wouldn't be able to hold it erect  we wouldn't be able to look at the world around us. This woman is slowly dying because the benign tumors in her facial bones have completely obliterated her mouth and her nose so she can't breathe and eat. Attached to the facial bones that define our face's structure are the muscles that deliver our facial expression  our universal language of expression  our social signaling system. And overlying this is the skin drape  which is a hugely complex three dimensional structure    taking right angled bends here and there  having thin areas like the eyelids  thick areas like the cheek  different colors. And then we have the sensual factor of the face. Where do we like to kiss people  On the lips. Nibble the ears maybe. It's the face where we're attracted to with that. But let's not forget the hair. You're looking at the image on your left hand side    that's my son with his eyebrows present. Look how odd he looks with the eyebrows missing. There's a definite difference. And imagine if he had hair sprouting from the middle of his nose  he'd look even odder still. Dysmorphophobia is an extreme version of the fact that we don't see ourselves as others see us. It's a shocking truth that we only see mirror images of ourselves  and we only see ourselves in freeze frame photographic images that capture a mere fraction of the time that we live. Dysmorphophobia is a perversion of this where people who may be very good looking regard themselves as hideously ugly and are constantly seeking surgery to correct their facial appearance. They don't need this. They need psychiatric help. Max has kindly donated his photograph to me. He doesn't have dysmorphophobia  but I'm using his photograph to illustrate the fact that he looks exactly like a dysmorphophobic. In other words  he looks entirely normal. Age is another thing when our attitude toward our appearance changes. So children judge themselves  learn to judge themselves  by the behavior of adults around them. Here's a classic example  Rebecca has a benign blood vessel tumor that's growing out through her skull  has obliterated her nose  and she's having difficulty seeing. As you can see  it's blocking her vision. She's also in danger  when she damages this  of bleeding profusely. Our research has shown that the parents and close loved ones of these children adore them. They've grown used to their face  they think they're special. Actually  sometimes the parents argue about whether these children should have the lesion removed. And occasionally they suffer intense grief reactions because the child they've grown to love has changed so dramatically and they don't recognize them. But other adults say incredibly painful things. They say   How dare you take this child out of the house and terrify other people. Shouldn't you be doing something about this  Why haven't you had it removed   And other children in curiosity come up and poke the lesion  because    a natural curiosity. And that obviously alerts the child to their unusual nature. After surgery  everything normalizes. The adults behave more naturally  and the children play more readily with other children. As teenagers    just think back to your teenage years    we're going through a dramatic and often disproportionate change in our facial appearance. We're trying to struggle to find our identity. We crave the approval of our peers. So our facial appearance is vital to us as we're trying to project ourselves to the world. Just remember that single acne spot that crippled you for several days. How long did you spend looking in the mirror every day  practicing your sardonic look  practicing your serious look  trying to look like Sean Connery  as I did  trying to raise one eyebrow  It's a crippling time. I've chosen to show this profile view of Sue because what it shows is her lower jaw jutting forward and her lower lip jutting forward. I'd like you all in the audience now to push your lower jaw forward. Turn to the person next to you  push your lower jaws forward. Turn to the person next to you and look at them    they look miserable. That's exactly what people used to say to Sue. She wasn't miserable at all. But people used to say to her   Why are you so miserable   People were making misjudgments all the time on her mood. Teachers and peers were underestimating her  she was teased at school. So she chose to have facial surgery. After the facial surgery  she said   My face now reflects my personality. People know now that I'm enthusiastic  that I'm a happy person.  And that's the change that can be achieved for teenagers. Is this change  though  a real change  or is it a figment of the imagination of the patient themselves  Well we studied teenagers' attitudes to photographs of patients having this corrective facial surgery. And what we found was    we jumbled up the photographs so they couldn't recognize the before and after    what we found was that the patients were regarded as being more attractive after the surgery. Well that's not surprising  but we also asked them to judge them on honesty  intelligence  friendliness  violence. They were all perceived as being less than normal in all those characteristics    more violent  etc.    before the surgery. After the surgery  they were perceived as being more intelligent  more friendly  more honest  less violent    and yet we hadn't operated on their intellect or their character. When people get older  they don't necessarily choose to follow this kind of surgery. Their presence in the consultation suite is a result of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. What happens to them is that they may have suffered cancer or trauma. So this is a photograph of Henry  two weeks after he had a malignant cancer removed from the left side of his face    his cheekbone  his upper jaw  his eye socket. He looks pretty good at this stage. But over the course of the next    years he had    more operations  as the disease ravaged his face and destroyed my reconstruction regularly. I learned a huge amount from Henry. Henry taught me that you can carry on working. He worked as an advocate. He continued to play cricket. He enjoyed life to the full  and this was probably because he had a successful  fulfilling job and a caring family and was able to participate socially. He maintained a calm insouciance. I don't say he overcame this  he didn't overcome it. This was something more than that. He ignored it. He ignored the disfigurement that was happening in his life and carried on oblivious to it. And that's what these people can do. Henriapi illustrates this phenomenon as well. This is a man in his   s whose first visit out of Nigeria was with this malignant cancer that he came to the United Kingdom to have operated on. It was my longest operation. It took    hours. I did it with my neurosurgeon. We removed all the bones at the right side of his face    his eye  his nose  the skull bones  the facial skin    and reconstructed him with tissue from the back. He continued to work as a psychiatric nurse. He got married. He had a son called Jeremiah. And again  he said   This painting of me with my son Jeremiah shows me as the successful man that I feel that I am.  His facial disfigurement did not affect him because he had the support of a family  he had a successful  fulfilling job. So we've seen that we can change people's faces. But when we change people's faces  are we changing their identity    for better or for worse  For instance  there are two different types of facial surgery. We can categorize it like that. We can say there are patients who choose to have facial surgery    like Sue. When they have facial surgery  they feel their lives have changed because other people perceive them as better people. They don't feel different. They feel that they've actually gained what they never had  that their face now reflects their personality. And actually that's probably the difference between cosmetic surgery and this kind of surgery. Because you might say   Well  this type of surgery might be regarded as cosmetic.  If you do cosmetic surgery  patients are often less happy. They're trying to achieve difference in their lives. Sue wasn't trying to achieve difference in her life. She was just trying to achieve the face that matched her personality. But then we have other people who don't choose to have facial surgery. They're people who have their face shot off. I'll move it off  and we'll have a blank slide for those who are squeamish amongst you. They have it forced upon them. And again  as I told you  if they have a caring family and good work life  then they can lead normal and fulfilled lives. Their identity doesn't change. Is this business about appearance and preoccupation with it a Western phenomenon  Muzetta's family give the lie to this. This is a little Bangladeshi girl from the east end of London who's got a huge malignant tumor on the right side of her face  which has already made her blind and which is rapidly growing and is going to kill her shortly. After she had surgery to remove the tumor  her parents dressed her in this beautiful green velvet dress  a pink ribbon in her hair  and they wanted the painting to be shown around the world  despite the fact that they were orthodox Muslims and the mother wore a full burqa. So it's not simply a Western phenomenon. We make judgments on people's faces all the time. It's been going on since we can think of Lombroso and the way he would define criminal faces. He said you could see criminal faces  judging them just on the photographs that were showed. Good looking people are always judged as being more friendly. We look at O.J.    he's a good looking guy. We'd like to spend time with him. He looks friendly. Now we know that he's a convicted wife batterer  and actually he's not the good guy. And beauty doesn't equate to goodness  and certainly doesn't equate to contentment. So we've talked about the static face and judging the static face  but actually  we're more comfortable with judging the moving face. We think we can judge people on their expressions. U.K. jurors in the U.K. justice system like to see a live witness to see whether they can pick up the telltale signs of mendacity    the blink  the hesitation. And so they want to see live witnesses. Todorov tells us that  in a tenth of a second  we can make a judgment on somebody's face. Are we uncomfortable with this image  Yes  we are. Would we be happy if our doctor's face  our lawyer's face  our financial adviser's face was covered  We'd be pretty uncomfortable. But are we good at making the judgments on facial appearance and movement  The truth is that there's a five minute rule  not the tenth of a second rule like Todorov  but a five minute rule. If you spend five minutes with somebody  you start looking beyond their facial appearance  and the people who you're initially attracted to may seem boring and you lose interest in them  and the people who you didn't immediately seek out  because you didn't find them particularly attractive  become attractive people because of their personality. So we've talked a lot about facial appearance. I now want to share a little bit of the surgery that we do    where we're at and where we're going. This is an image of Ann who's had her right jaw removed and the base of her skull removed. And you can see in the images afterward  we've managed to reconstruct her successfully. But that's not good enough. This is what Ann wants. She wants to be out kayaking  she wants to be out climbing mountains. And that's what she achieved  and that's what we have to get to. This is a horrific image  so I'm putting my hand up now. This is a photograph of Adi  a Nigerian bank manager who had his face shot off in an armed robbery. And he lost his lower jaw  his lip  his chin and his upper jaw and teeth. This is the bar that he set for us.  I want to look like this. This is how I looked before.  So with modern technology  we used computers to make models. We made a model of the jaw without bone in it. We then bent a plate up to it. We put it in place so we knew it was an accurate position. We then put bone and tissue from the back. Here you can see the plate holding it  and you can see the implants being put in    so that in one operation we achieve this and this. So the patient's life is restored. That's the good news. However  his chin skin doesn't look the same as it did before. It's skin from his back. It's thicker  it's darker  it's coarser  it doesn't have the contours. And that's where we're failing  and that's where we need the face transplant. The face transplant has a role probably in burns patients to replace the skin. We can replace the underlying skeletal structure  but we're still not good at replacing the facial skin. So it's very valuable to have that tool in our armamentarium. But the patients are going to have to take drugs that suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives. What does that mean  They have an increased risk of infection  an increased risk of malignancy. This is not a life saving transplant    like a heart  or liver  or lung transplant    it is a quality of life transplant  and as a result  are the patients going to say  if they get a malignant cancer    or    years on   I wish I'd had conventional reconstructive techniques rather than this because I'm now dying of a malignant cancer   We don't know yet. We also don't know what they feel about recognition and identity. Bernard Devauchelle and Sylvie Testelin  who did the first operation  are studying that. Donors are going to be short on the ground  because how many people want to have their loved one's face removed at the point of death  So there are going to be problems with face transplantation. So the better news is the future's almost here    and the future is tissue engineering. Just imagine  I can make a biologically degradable template. I can put it in place where it's meant to be. I can sprinkle a few cells  stem cells from the patient's own hip  a little bit of genetically engineered protein  and lo and behold  leave it for four months and the face is grown. This is a bit like a Julia Child recipe. But we've still got problems. We've got mouth cancer to solve. We're still not curing enough patients    it's the most disfiguring cancer. We're still not reconstructing them well enough. In the U.K. we have an epidemic of facial injuries among young people. We still can't get rid of scars. We need to do research. And the best news of all is that surgeons know that we need to do research. And we've set up charities that will help us fund the clinical research to determine the best treatment practice now and better treatment into the future  so we don't just sit on our laurels and say   Okay  we're doing okay. Let's leave it as it is.  Thank you very much indeed. As a child  I was raised by native Hawaiian elders    three old women who took care of me while my parents worked. The year is     . We're at the ocean. It's twilight. We're watching the rising of the stars and the shifting of the tides. It's a stretch of beach we know so well. The smooth stones on the sand are familiar to us. If you saw these women on the street in their faded clothes  you might dismiss them as poor and simple. That would be a mistake. These women are descendants of Polynesian navigators  trained in the old ways by their elders  and now they're passing it on to me. They teach me the names of the winds and the rains  of astronomy according to a genealogy of stars. There's a new moon on the horizon. Hawaiians say it's a good night for fishing. They begin to chant.  Hawaiian chant  When they finish  they sit in a circle and ask me to come to join them. They want to teach me about my destiny. I thought every seven year old went through this.  Baby girl  someday the world will be in trouble. People will forget their wisdom. It will take elders' voices from the far corners of the world to call the world into balance. You will go far away. It will sometimes be a lonely road. We will not be there. But you will look into the eyes of seeming strangers  and you will recognize your ohana  your family. And it will take all of you. It will take all of you.  These words  I hold onto all my life. Because the idea of doing it alone terrifies me. The year is     . I'm on a remote island in Micronesia. Satawal is one half mile long by one mile wide. It's the home of my mentor. His name is Pius Mau Piailug. Mau is a palu  a navigator priest. He's also considered the greatest wave finder in the world. There are fewer than a handful of palu left on this island. Their tradition is so extraordinary that these mariners sailed three million square miles across the Pacific without the use of instruments. They could synthesize patterns in nature using the rising and setting of stars  the sequence and direction of waves  the flight patterns of certain birds. Even the slightest hint of color on the underbelly of a cloud would inform them and help them navigate with the keenest accuracy. When Western scientists would join Mau on the canoe and watch him go into the hull  it appeared that an old man was going to rest. In fact  the hull of the canoe is the womb of the vessel. It is the most accurate place to feel the rhythm and sequence and direction of waves. Mau was  in fact  gathering explicit data using his entire body. It's what he had been trained to do since he was five years old. Now science may dismiss this methodology  but Polynesian navigators use it today because it provides them an accurate determination of the angle and direction of their vessel. The palu also had an uncanny ability to forecast weather conditions days in advance. Sometimes I'd be with Mau on a cloud covered night and we'd sit at the easternmost coast of the island  and he would look out  and then he would say   Okay  we go.  He saw that first glint of light    he knew what the weather was going to be three days from now. Their achievements  intellectually and scientifically  are extraordinary  and they are so relevant for these times that we are in when we are riding out storms. We are in such a critical moment of our collective history. They have been compared to astronauts    these elder navigators who sail vast open oceans in double hulled canoes thousands of miles from a small island. Their canoes  our rockets  their sea  our space. The wisdom of these elders is not a mere collection of stories about old people in some remote spot. This is part of our collective narrative. It's humanity's DNA. We cannot afford to lose it. The year is     . Just as the women in Hawaii that raised me predicted  the world is in trouble. We live in a society bloated with data  yet starved for wisdom. We're connected       yet anxiety  fear  depression and loneliness is at an all time high. We must course correct. An African shaman said   Your society worships the jester while the king stands in plain clothes.  The link between the past and the future is fragile. This I know intimately  because even as I travel throughout the world to listen to these stories and record them  I struggle. I am haunted by the fact that I no longer remember the names of the winds and the rains. Mau passed away five months ago  but his legacy and lessons live on. And I am reminded that throughout the world there are cultures with vast sums of knowledge in them  as potent as the Micronesian navigators  that are going dismissed  that this is a testament to brilliant  brilliant technology and science and wisdom that is vanishing rapidly. Because when an elder dies a library is burned  and throughout the world  libraries are ablaze. I am grateful for the fact that I had a mentor like Mau who taught me how to navigate. And I realize through a lesson that he shared that we continue to find our way. And this is what he said   The island is the canoe  the canoe  the island.  And what he meant was  if you are voyaging and far from home  your very survival depends on everyone aboard. You cannot make the voyage alone  you were never meant to. This whole notion of every man for himself is completely unsustainable. It always was. So in closing I would offer you this  The planet is our canoe  and we are the voyagers. True navigation begins in the human heart. It's the most important map of all. Together  may we journey well. I admit that I'm a little bit nervous here because I'm going to say some radical things  about how we should think about cancer differently  to an audience that contains a lot of people who know a lot more about cancer than I do. But I will also contest that I'm not as nervous as I should be because I'm pretty sure I'm right about this. And that this  in fact  will be the way that we treat cancer in the future. In order to talk about cancer  I'm going to actually have to    let me get the big slide here. First  I'm going to try to give you a different perspective of genomics. I want to put it in perspective of the bigger picture of all the other things that are going on    and then talk about something you haven't heard so much about  which is proteomics. Having explained those  that will set up for what I think will be a different idea about how to go about treating cancer. So let me start with genomics. It is the hot topic. It is the place where we're learning the most. This is the great frontier. But it has its limitations. And in particular  you've probably all heard the analogy that the genome is like the blueprint of your body  and if that were only true  it would be great  but it's not. It's like the parts list of your body. It doesn't say how things are connected  what causes what and so on. So if I can make an analogy  let's say that you were trying to tell the difference between a good restaurant  a healthy restaurant and a sick restaurant  and all you had was the list of ingredients that they had in their larder. So it might be that  if you went to a French restaurant and you looked through it and you found they only had margarine and they didn't have butter  you could say   Ah  I see what's wrong with them. I can make them healthy.  And there probably are special cases of that. You could certainly tell the difference between a Chinese restaurant and a French restaurant by what they had in a larder. So the list of ingredients does tell you something  and sometimes it tells you something that's wrong. If they have tons of salt  you might guess they're using too much salt  or something like that. But it's limited  because really to know if it's a healthy restaurant  you need to taste the food  you need to know what goes on in the kitchen  you need the product of all of those ingredients. So if I look at a person and I look at a person's genome  it's the same thing. The part of the genome that we can read is the list of ingredients. And so indeed  there are times when we can find ingredients that  are  bad. Cystic fibrosis is an example of a disease where you just have a bad ingredient and you have a disease  and we can actually make a direct correspondence between the ingredient and the disease. But most things  you really have to know what's going on in the kitchen  because  mostly  sick people used to be healthy people    they have the same genome. So the genome really tells you much more about predisposition. So what you can tell is you can tell the difference between an Asian person and a European person by looking at their ingredients list. But you really for the most part can't tell the difference between a healthy person and a sick person    except in some of these special cases. So why all the big deal about genetics  Well first of all  it's because we can read it  which is fantastic. It is very useful in certain circumstances. It's also the great theoretical triumph of biology. It's the one theory that the biologists ever really got right. It's fundamental to Darwin and Mendel and so on. And so it's the one thing where they predicted a theoretical construct. So Mendel had this idea of a gene as an abstract thing  and Darwin built a whole theory that depended on them existing  and then Watson and Crick actually looked and found one. So this happens in physics all the time. You predict a black hole  and you look out the telescope and there it is  just like you said. But it rarely happens in biology. So this great triumph    it's so good  there's almost a religious experience in biology. And Darwinian evolution is really the core theory. So the other reason it's been very popular is because we can measure it  it's digital. And in fact  thanks to Kary Mullis  you can basically measure your genome in your kitchen with a few extra ingredients. So for instance  by measuring the genome  we've learned a lot about how we're related to other kinds of animals by the closeness of our genome  or how we're related to each other    the family tree  or the tree of life. There's a huge amount of information about the genetics just by comparing the genetic similarity. Now of course  in medical application  that is very useful because it's the same kind of information that the doctor gets from your family medical history    except probably  your genome knows much more about your medical history than you do. And so by reading the genome  we can find out much more about your family than you probably know. And so we can discover things that probably you could have found by looking at enough of your relatives  but they may be surprising. I did the   andMe thing and was very surprised to discover that I am fat and bald. But sometimes you can learn much more useful things about that. But mostly what you need to know  to find out if you're sick  is not your predispositions  but it's actually what's going on in your body right now. So to do that  what you really need to do  you need to look at the things that the genes are producing and what's happening after the genetics  and that's what proteomics is about. Just like genome mixes the study of all the genes  proteomics is the study of all the proteins. And the proteins are all of the little things in your body that are signaling between the cells    actually  the machines that are operating    that's where the action is. Basically  a human body is a conversation going on  both within the cells and between the cells  and they're telling each other to grow and to die  and when you're sick  something's gone wrong with that conversation. And so the trick is    unfortunately  we don't have an easy way to measure these like we can measure the genome. So the problem is that measuring    if you try to measure all the proteins  it's a very elaborate process. It requires hundreds of steps  and it takes a long  long time. And it matters how much of the protein it is. It could be very significant that a protein changed by    percent  so it's not a nice digital thing like DNA. And basically our problem is somebody's in the middle of this very long stage  they pause for just a moment  and they leave something in an enzyme for a second  and all of a sudden all the measurements from then on don't work. And so then people get very inconsistent results when they do it this way. People have tried very hard to do this. I tried this a couple of times and looked at this problem and gave up on it. I kept getting this call from this oncologist named David Agus. And Applied Minds gets a lot of calls from people who want help with their problems  and I didn't think this was a very likely one to call back  so I kept on giving him to the delay list. And then one day  I get a call from John Doerr  Bill Berkman and Al Gore on the same day saying return David Agus's phone call. So I was like   Okay. This guy's at least resourceful.  So we started talking  and he said   I really need a better way to measure proteins.  I'm like   Looked at that. Been there. Not going to be easy.  He's like   No  no. I really need it. I mean  I see patients dying every day because we don't know what's going on inside of them. We have to have a window into this.  And he took me through specific examples of when he really needed it. And I realized  wow  this would really make a big difference  if we could do it  and so I said   Well  let's look at it.  Applied Minds has enough play money that we can go and just work on something without getting anybody's funding or permission or anything. So we started playing around with this. And as we did it  we realized this was the basic problem    that taking the sip of coffee    that there were humans doing this complicated process and that what really needed to be done was to automate this process like an assembly line and build robots that would measure proteomics. And so we did that  and working with David  we made a little company called Applied Proteomics eventually  which makes this robotic assembly line  which  in a very consistent way  measures the protein. And I'll show you what that protein measurement looks like. Basically  what we do is we take a drop of blood out of a patient  and we sort out the proteins in the drop of blood according to how much they weigh  how slippery they are  and we arrange them in an image. And so we can look at literally hundreds of thousands of features at once out of that drop of blood. And we can take a different one tomorrow  and you will see your proteins tomorrow will be different    they'll be different after you eat or after you sleep. They really tell us what's going on there. And so this picture  which looks like a big smudge to you  is actually the thing that got me really thrilled about this and made me feel like we were on the right track. So if I zoom into that picture  I can just show you what it means. We sort out the proteins    from left to right is the weight of the fragments that we're getting  and from top to bottom is how slippery they are. So we're zooming in here just to show you a little bit of it. And so each of these lines represents some signal that we're getting out of a piece of a protein. And you can see how the lines occur in these little groups of bump  bump  bump  bump  bump. And that's because we're measuring the weight so precisely that    carbon comes in different isotopes  so if it has an extra neutron on it  we actually measure it as a different chemical. So we're actually measuring each isotope as a different one. And so that gives you an idea of how exquisitely sensitive this is. So seeing this picture is sort of like getting to be Galileo and looking at the stars and looking through the telescope for the first time  and suddenly you say   Wow  it's way more complicated than we thought it was.  But we can see that stuff out there and actually see features of it. So this is the signature out of which we're trying to get patterns. So what we do with this is  for example  we can look at two patients  one that responded to a drug and one that didn't respond to a drug  and ask   What's going on differently inside of them   And so we can make these measurements precisely enough that we can overlay two patients and look at the differences. So here we have Alice in green and Bob in red. We overlay them. This is actual data. And you can see  mostly it overlaps and it's yellow  but there's some things that just Alice has and some things that just Bob has. And if we find a pattern of things of the responders to the drug  we see that in the blood  they have the condition that allows them to respond to this drug. We might not even know what this protein is  but we can see it's a marker for the response to the disease. So this already  I think  is tremendously useful in all kinds of medicine. But I think this is actually just the beginning of how we're going to treat cancer. So let me move to cancer. The thing about cancer    when I got into this  I really knew nothing about it  but working with David Agus  I started watching how cancer was actually being treated and went to operations where it was being cut out. And as I looked at it  to me it didn't make sense how we were approaching cancer  and in order to make sense of it  I had to learn where did this come from. We're treating cancer almost like it's an infectious disease. We're treating it as something that got inside of you that we have to kill. So this is the great paradigm. This is another case where a theoretical paradigm in biology really worked    was the germ theory of disease. So what doctors are mostly trained to do is diagnose    that is  put you into a category and apply a scientifically proven treatment for that diagnosis    and that works great for infectious diseases. So if we put you in the category of you've got syphilis  we can give you penicillin. We know that that works. If you've got malaria  we give you quinine or some derivative of it. And so that's the basic thing doctors are trained to do  and it's miraculous in the case of infectious disease    how well it works. And many people in this audience probably wouldn't be alive if doctors didn't do this. But now let's apply that to systems diseases like cancer. The problem is that  in cancer  there isn't something else that's inside of you. It's you  you're broken. That conversation inside of you got mixed up in some way. So how do we diagnose that conversation  Well  right now what we do is we divide it by part of the body    you know  where did it appear     and we put you in different categories according to the part of the body. And then we do a clinical trial for a drug for lung cancer and one for prostate cancer and one for breast cancer  and we treat these as if they're separate diseases and that this way of dividing them had something to do with what actually went wrong. And of course  it really doesn't have that much to do with what went wrong because cancer is a failure of the system. And in fact  I think we're even wrong when we talk about cancer as a thing. I think this is the big mistake. I think cancer should not be a noun. We should talk about cancering as something we do  not something we have. And so those tumors  those are symptoms of cancer. And so your body is probably cancering all the time  but there are lots of systems in your body that keep it under control. And so to give you an idea of an analogy of what I mean by thinking of cancering as a verb  imagine we didn't know anything about plumbing  and the way that we talked about it  we'd come home and we'd find a leak in our kitchen and we'd say   Oh  my house has water.  We might divide it    the plumber would say   Well  where's the water    Well  it's in the kitchen.   Oh  you must have kitchen water.  That's kind of the level at which it is.  Kitchen water  well  first of all  we'll go in there and we'll mop out a lot of it. And then we know that if we sprinkle Drano around the kitchen  that helps. Whereas living room water  it's better to do tar on the roof.  And it sounds silly  but that's basically what we do. And I'm not saying you shouldn't mop up your water if you have cancer  but I'm saying that's not really the problem  that's the symptom of the problem. What we really need to get at is the process that's going on  and that's happening at the level of the proteonomic actions  happening at the level of why is your body not healing itself in the way that it normally does  Because normally  your body is dealing with this problem all the time. So your house is dealing with leaks all the time  but it's fixing them. It's draining them out and so on. So what we need is to have a causative model of what's actually going on  and proteomics actually gives us the ability to build a model like that. David got me invited to give a talk at National Cancer Institute and Anna Barker was there. And so I gave this talk and said   Why don't you guys do this   And Anna said   Because nobody within cancer would look at it this way. But what we're going to do  is we're going to create a program for people outside the field of cancer to get together with doctors who really know about cancer and work out different programs of research.  So David and I applied to this program and created a consortium at USC where we've got some of the best oncologists in the world and some of the best biologists in the world  from Cold Spring Harbor  Stanford  Austin    I won't even go through and name all the places    to have a research project that will last for five years where we're really going to try to build a model of cancer like this. We're doing it in mice first  and we will kill a lot of mice in the process of doing this  but they will die for a good cause. And we will actually try to get to the point where we have a predictive model where we can understand  when cancer happens  what's actually happening in there and which treatment will treat that cancer. So let me just end with giving you a little picture of what I think cancer treatment will be like in the future. So I think eventually  once we have one of these models for people  which we'll get eventually    I mean  our group won't get all the way there    but eventually we'll have a very good computer model    sort of like a global climate model for weather. It has lots of different information about what's the process going on in this proteomic conversation on many different scales. And so we will simulate in that model for your particular cancer    and this also will be for ALS  or any kind of system neurodegenerative diseases  things like that    we will simulate specifically you  not just a generic person  but what's actually going on inside you. And in that simulation  what we could do is design for you specifically a sequence of treatments  and it might be very gentle treatments  very small amounts of drugs. It might be things like  don't eat that day  or give them a little chemotherapy  maybe a little radiation. Of course  we'll do surgery sometimes and so on. But design a program of treatments specifically for you and help your body guide back to health    guide your body back to health. Because your body will do most of the work of fixing it if we just sort of prop it up in the ways that are wrong. We put it in the equivalent of splints. And so your body basically has lots and lots of mechanisms for fixing cancer  and we just have to prop those up in the right way and get them to do the job. And so I believe that this will be the way that cancer will be treated in the future. It's going to require a lot of work  a lot of research. There will be many teams like our team that work on this. But I think eventually  we will design for everybody a custom treatment for cancer. So thank you very much.
