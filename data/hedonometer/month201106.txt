I spent the best part of last year working on a documentary about my own happiness    trying to see if I can actually train my mind in a particular way  like I can train my body  so I can end up with an improved feeling of overall well being. Then this January  my mother died  and pursuing a film like that just seemed the last thing that was interesting to me. So in a very typical  silly designer fashion  after years worth of work  pretty much all I have to show for it are the titles for the film. They were still done when I was on sabbatical with my company in Indonesia. We can see the first part here was designed here by pigs. It was a little bit too funky  and we wanted a more feminine point of view and employed a duck who did it in a much more fitting way    fashion. My studio in Bali was only    minutes away from a monkey forest  and monkeys  of course  are supposed to be the happiest of all animals. So we trained them to be able to do three separate words  to lay out them properly. You can see  there still is a little bit of a legibility problem there. The serif is not really in place. So of course  what you don't do properly yourself is never deemed done really. So this is us climbing onto the trees and putting it up over the Sayan Valley in Indonesia. In that year  what I did do a lot was look at all sorts of surveys  looking at a lot of data on this subject. And it turns out that men and women report very  very similar levels of happiness. This is a very quick overview of all the studies that I looked at. That climate plays no role. That if you live in the best climate  in San Diego in the United States  or in the shittiest climate  in Buffalo  New York  you are going to be just as happy in either place. If you make more than        bucks a year in the U.S.  any salary increase you're going to experience will have only a tiny  tiny influence on your overall well being. Black people are just as happy as white people are. If you're old or young it doesn't really make a difference. If you're ugly or if you're really  really good looking it makes no difference whatsoever. You will adapt to it and get used to it. If you have manageable health problems it doesn't really matter. Now this does matter. So now the woman on the right is actually much happier than the guy on the left    meaning that  if you have a lot of friends  and you have meaningful friendships  that does make a lot of difference. As well as being married    you are likely to be much happier than if you are single. A fellow TED speaker  Jonathan Haidt  came up with this beautiful little analogy between the conscious and the unconscious mind. He says that the conscious mind is this tiny rider on this giant elephant  the unconscious. And the rider thinks that he can tell the elephant what to do  but the elephant really has his own ideas. If I look at my own life  I'm born in      in Austria. If I would have been born a hundred years earlier  the big decisions in my life would have been made for me    meaning I would have stayed in the town that I was born in  I would have very much likely entered the same profession that my dad did  and I would have very much likely married a woman that my mom had selected. I  of course  and all of us  are very much in charge of these big decisions in our lives. We live where we want to be    at least in the West. We become what we really are interested in. We choose our own profession  and we choose our own partners. And so it's quite surprising that many of us let our unconscious influence those decisions in ways that we are not quite aware of. If you look at the statistics and you see that the guy called George  when he decides on where he wants to live    is it Florida or North Dakota     he goes and lives in Georgia. And if you look at a guy called Dennis  when he decides what to become    is it a lawyer  or does he want to become a doctor or a teacher     best chance is that he wants to become a dentist. And if Paula decides should she marry Joe or Jack  somehow Paul sounds the most interesting. And so even if we make those very important decisions for very silly reasons  it remains statistically true that there are more Georges living in Georgia and there are more Dennises becoming dentists and there are more Paulas who are married to Paul than statistically viable. Now I  of course  thought   Well this is American data   and I thought   Well  those silly Americans. They get influenced by things that they're not aware of. This is just completely ridiculous.  Then  of course  I looked at my mom and my dad    Karolina and Karl  and grandmom and granddad  Josefine and Josef. So I am looking still for a Stephanie. I'll figure something out. If I make this whole thing a little bit more personal and see what makes me happy as a designer  the easiest answer  of course  is do more of the stuff that I like to do and much less of the stuff that I don't like to do    for which it would be helpful to know what it is that I actually do like to do. I'm a big list maker  so I came up with a list. One of them is to think without pressure. This is a project we're working on right now with a very healthy deadline. It's a book on culture  and  as you can see  culture is rapidly drifting around. Doing things like I'm doing right now    traveling to Cannes. The example I have here is a chair that came out of the year in Bali    clearly influenced by local manufacturing and culture  not being stuck behind a single computer screen all day long and be here and there. Quite consciously  design projects that need an incredible amount of various techniques  just basically to fight straightforward adaptation. Being close to the content    that's the content really is close to my heart. This is a bus  or vehicle  for a charity  for an NGO that wants to double the education budget in the United States    carefully designed  so  by two inches  it still clears highway overpasses. Having end results    things that come back from the printer well  like this little business card for an animation company called Sideshow on lenticular foils. Working on projects that actually have visible impacts  like a book for a deceased German artist whose widow came to us with the requirement to make her late husband famous. It just came out six months ago  and it's getting unbelievable traction right now in Germany. And I think that his widow is going to be very successful on her quest. And lately  to be involved in projects where I know about    percent of the project technique wise and the other    percent would be new. So in this case  it's an outside projection for Singapore on these giant Times Square like screens. And I of course knew stuff  as a designer  about typography  even though we worked with those animals not so successfully. But I didn't quite know all that much about movement or film. And from that point of view we turned it into a lovely project. But also because the content was very close. In this case   Keeping a Diary Supports Personal Development     I've been keeping a diary since I was   . And I've found that it influenced my life and work in a very intriguing way. In this case also because it's part of one of the many sentiments that we build the whole series on    that all the sentiments originally had come out of the diary. Thank you so much. This is a representation of your brain  and your brain can be broken into two parts. There's the left half  which is the logical side  and then the right half  which is the intuitive. And so if we had a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere  then we can plot our brain. And for example  this would be somebody who's completely logical. This would be someone who's entirely intuitive. So where would you put your brain on this scale  Some of us may have opted for one of these extremes  but I think for most people in the audience  your brain is something like this    with a high aptitude in both hemispheres at the same time. It's not like they're mutually exclusive or anything. You can be logical and intuitive. And so I consider myself one of these people  along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists  who need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas. But at the same time  we need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work. How do we develop this intuition  Well we like to play with stuff. So we go out and play with it  and then we see how it acts  and then we develop our intuition from there. And really you do the same thing. So some intuition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time. I mean  it can sound weird to think about one thing being in two different places at the same time  but you weren't born with this notion  you developed it. And I remember watching a kid playing on a car stop. He was just a toddler and he wasn't very good at it  and he kept falling over. But I bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson  and that's that large things don't let you get right past them  and that they stay in one place. And so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world  unless you're a particle physicist. It'd be a terrible model for a particle physicist  because they don't play with car stops  they play with these little weird particles. And when they play with their particles  they find they do all sorts of really weird things    like they can fly right through walls  or they can be in two different places at the same time. And so they wrote down all these observations  and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics. And so that's where physics was at a few years ago  you needed quantum mechanics to describe little  tiny particles. But you didn't need it to describe the large  everyday objects around us. This didn't really sit well with my intuition  and maybe it's just because I don't play with particles very often. Well  I play with them sometimes  but not very often. And I've never seen them. I mean  nobody's ever seen a particle. But it didn't sit well with my logical side either. Because if everything is made up of little particles and all the little particles follow quantum mechanics  then shouldn't everything just follow quantum mechanics  I don't see any reason why it shouldn't. And so I'd feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that an everyday object also follows quantum mechanics. So a few years ago  I set off to do just that. So I made one. This is the first object that you can see that has been in a mechanical quantum superposition. So what we're looking at here is a tiny computer chip. And you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle. And that's this piece of metal I'm going to be talking about in a minute. This is a photograph of the object. And here I'll zoom in a little bit. We're looking right there in the center. And then here's a really  really big close up of the little piece of metal. So what we're looking at is a little chunk of metal  and it's shaped like a diving board  and it's sticking out over a ledge. And so I made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip. I went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer  and then I just cranked away at all the big machines for about     hours. For the last stuff  I had to build my own machine    to make this swimming pool shaped hole underneath the device. This device has the ability to be in a quantum superposition  but it needs a little help to do it. Here  let me give you an analogy. You know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator  I mean  when I'm in an elevator all alone  I do all sorts of weird things  but then other people get on board and I stop doing those things because I don't want to bother them  or  frankly  scare them. So quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects feel the same way. The fellow passengers for inanimate objects are not just people  but it's also the light shining on it and the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room. And so we knew  if we wanted to see this piece of metal behave quantum mechanically  we're going to have to kick out all the other passengers. And so that's what we did. We turned off the lights  and then we put it in a vacuum and sucked out all the air  and then we cooled it down to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero. Now  all alone in the elevator  the little chunk of metal is free to act however it wanted. And so we measured its motion. We found it was moving in really weird ways. Instead of just sitting perfectly still  it was vibrating  and the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this    like expanding and contracting bellows. And by giving it a gentle nudge  we were able to make it both vibrate and not vibrate at the same time    something that's only allowed with quantum mechanics. So what I'm telling you here is something truly fantastic. What does it mean for one thing to be both vibrating and not vibrating at the same time  So let's think about the atoms. So in one case  all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal are sitting still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down. Now it's only at precise times when they align. The rest of the time they're delocalized. That means that every atom is in two different places at the same time  which in turn means the entire chunk of metal is in two different places. I think this is really cool. Really. It was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years because  check this out  the difference in scale between a single atom and that chunk of metal is about the same as the difference between that chunk of metal and you. So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time  that chunk of metal can be in two different places  then why not you  I mean  this is just my logical side talking. So imagine if you're in multiple places at the same time  what would that be like  How would your consciousness handle your body being delocalized in space  There's one more part to the story. It's when we warmed it up  and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box  we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece. And so I had to develop this new intuition  that it seems like all the objects in the elevator are really just quantum objects just crammed into a tiny space. You hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected. Well  that's not quite right. It's more than that  it's deeper. It's that those connections  your connections to all the things around you  literally define who you are  and that's the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics. Thank you. I'm Jessi  and this is my suitcase. But before I show you what I've got inside  I'm going to make a very public confession  and that is  I'm outfit obsessed. I love finding  wearing  and more recently  photographing and blogging a different  colorful  crazy outfit for every single occasion. But I don't buy anything new. I get all my clothes secondhand from flea markets and thrift stores. Aww  thank you. Secondhand shopping allows me to reduce the impact my wardrobe has on the environment and on my wallet. I get to meet all kinds of great people  my dollars usually go to a good cause  I look pretty unique  and it makes shopping like my own personal treasure hunt. I mean  what am I going to find today  Is it going to be my size  Will I like the color  Will it be under      If all the answers are yes  I feel as though I've won. I want to get back to my suitcase and tell you what I packed for this exciting week here at TED. I mean  what does somebody with all these outfits bring with her  So I'm going to show you exactly what I brought. I brought seven pairs of underpants and that's it. Exactly one week's worth of undies is all I put in my suitcase. I was betting that I'd be able to find everything else I could possible want to wear once I got here to Palm Springs. And since you don't know me as the woman walking around TED in her underwear    that means I found a few things. And I'd really love to show you my week's worth of outfits right now. Does that sound good  So as I do this  I'm also going to tell you a few of the life lessons that  believe it or not  I have picked up in these adventures wearing nothing new. So let's start with Sunday. I call this  Shiny Tiger.  You do not have to spend a lot of money to look great. You can almost always look phenomenal for under    . This whole outfit  including the jacket  cost me      and it was the most expensive thing that I wore the entire week. Monday  Color is powerful. It is almost physiologically impossible to be in a bad mood when you're wearing bright red pants. If you are happy  you are going to attract other happy people to you. Tuesday  Fitting in is way overrated. I've spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in. Just be who you are. If you are surrounding yourself with the right people  they will not only get it  they will appreciate it. Wednesday  Embrace your inner child. Sometimes people tell me that I look like I'm playing dress up  or that I remind them of their seven year old. I like to smile and say   Thank you.  Thursday  Confidence is key. If you think you look good in something  you almost certainly do. And if you don't think you look good in something  you're also probably right. I grew up with a mom who taught me this day in and day out. But it wasn't until I turned    that I really got what this meant. And I'm going to break it down for you for just a second. If you believe you're a beautiful person inside and out  there is no look that you can't pull off. So there is no excuse for any of us here in this audience. We should be able to rock anything we want to rock. Thank you. Friday  A universal truth    five words for you  Gold sequins go with everything. And finally  Saturday  Developing your own unique personal style is a really great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word. It's been proven to me time and time again as people have walked up to me this week simply because of what I'm wearing  and we've had great conversations. So obviously this is not all going to fit back in my tiny suitcase. So before I go home to Brooklyn  I'm going to donate everything back. Because the lesson I'm trying to learn myself this week is that it's okay to let go. I don't need to get emotionally attached to these things because around the corner  there is always going to be another crazy  colorful  shiny outfit just waiting for me  if I put a little love in my heart and look. Thank you very much. Thank you. Power. That is the word that comes to mind. We're the new technologists. We have a lot of data  so we have a lot of power. How much power do we have  Scene from a movie   Apocalypse Now     great movie. We've got to get our hero  Captain Willard  to the mouth of the Nung River so he can go pursue Colonel Kurtz. The way we're going to do this is fly him in and drop him off. So the scene  the sky is filled with this fleet of helicopters carrying him in. And there's this loud  thrilling music in the background  this wild music.   Dum da ta da dum     Dum da ta da dum     Da ta da da   That's a lot of power. That's the kind of power I feel in this room. That's the kind of power we have because of all of the data that we have. Let's take an example. What can we do with just one person's data  What can we do with that guy's data  I can look at your financial records. I can tell if you pay your bills on time. I know if you're good to give a loan to. I can look at your medical records  I can see if your pump is still pumping    see if you're good to offer insurance to. I can look at your clicking patterns. When you come to my website  I actually know what you're going to do already because I've seen you visit millions of websites before. And I'm sorry to tell you  you're like a poker player  you have a tell. I can tell with data analysis what you're going to do before you even do it. I know what you like. I know who you are  and that's even before I look at your mail or your phone. Those are the kinds of things we can do with the data that we have. But I'm not actually here to talk about what we can do. I'm here to talk about what we should do. What's the right thing to do  Now I see some puzzled looks like   Why are you asking us what's the right thing to do  We're just building this stuff. Somebody else is using it.  Fair enough. But it brings me back. I think about World War II    some of our great technologists then  some of our great physicists  studying nuclear fission and fusion    just nuclear stuff. We gather together these physicists in Los Alamos to see what they'll build. We want the people building the technology thinking about what we should be doing with the technology. So what should we be doing with that guy's data  Should we be collecting it  gathering it  so we can make his online experience better  So we can make money  So we can protect ourselves if he was up to no good  Or should we respect his privacy  protect his dignity and leave him alone  Which one is it  How should we figure it out  I know  crowdsource. Let's crowdsource this. So to get people warmed up  let's start with an easy question    something I'm sure everybody here has an opinion about  iPhone versus Android. Let's do a show of hands    iPhone. Uh huh. Android. You'd think with a bunch of smart people we wouldn't be such suckers just for the pretty phones. Next question  a little bit harder. Should we be collecting all of that guy's data to make his experiences better and to protect ourselves in case he's up to no good  Or should we leave him alone  Collect his data. Leave him alone. You're safe. It's fine. Okay  last question    harder question    when trying to evaluate what we should do in this case  should we use a Kantian deontological moral framework  or should we use a Millian consequentialist one  Kant. Mill. Not as many votes. Yeah  that's a terrifying result. Terrifying  because we have stronger opinions about our hand held devices than about the moral framework we should use to guide our decisions. How do we know what to do with all the power we have if we don't have a moral framework  We know more about mobile operating systems  but what we really need is a moral operating system. What's a moral operating system  We all know right and wrong  right  You feel good when you do something right  you feel bad when you do something wrong. Our parents teach us that  praise with the good  scold with the bad. But how do we figure out what's right and wrong  And from day to day  we have the techniques that we use. Maybe we just follow our gut. Maybe we take a vote    we crowdsource. Or maybe we punt    ask the legal department  see what they say. In other words  it's kind of random  kind of ad hoc  how we figure out what we should do. And maybe  if we want to be on surer footing  what we really want is a moral framework that will help guide us there  that will tell us what kinds of things are right and wrong in the first place  and how would we know in a given situation what to do. So let's get a moral framework. We're numbers people  living by numbers. How can we use numbers as the basis for a moral framework  I know a guy who did exactly that. A brilliant guy    he's been dead       years. Plato  that's right. Remember him    old philosopher  You were sleeping during that class. And Plato  he had a lot of the same concerns that we did. He was worried about right and wrong. He wanted to know what is just. But he was worried that all we seem to be doing is trading opinions about this. He says something's just. She says something else is just. It's kind of convincing when he talks and when she talks too. I'm just going back and forth  I'm not getting anywhere. I don't want opinions  I want knowledge. I want to know the truth about justice    like we have truths in math. In math  we know the objective facts. Take a number  any number    two. Favorite number. I love that number. There are truths about two. If you've got two of something  you add two more  you get four. That's true no matter what thing you're talking about. It's an objective truth about the form of two  the abstract form. When you have two of anything    two eyes  two ears  two noses  just two protrusions    those all partake of the form of two. They all participate in the truths that two has. They all have two ness in them. And therefore  it's not a matter of opinion. What if  Plato thought  ethics was like math  What if there were a pure form of justice  What if there are truths about justice  and you could just look around in this world and see which things participated  partook of that form of justice  Then you would know what was really just and what wasn't. It wouldn't be a matter of just opinion or just appearances. That's a stunning vision. I mean  think about that. How grand. How ambitious. That's as ambitious as we are. He wants to solve ethics. He wants objective truths. If you think that way  you have a Platonist moral framework. If you don't think that way  well  you have a lot of company in the history of Western philosophy  because the tidy idea  you know  people criticized it. Aristotle  in particular  he was not amused. He thought it was impractical. Aristotle said   We should seek only so much precision in each subject as that subject allows.  Aristotle thought ethics wasn't a lot like math. He thought ethics was a matter of making decisions in the here and now using our best judgment to find the right path. If you think that  Plato's not your guy. But don't give up. Maybe there's another way that we can use numbers as the basis of our moral framework. How about this  What if in any situation you could just calculate  look at the choices  measure out which one's better and know what to do  That sound familiar  That's a utilitarian moral framework. John Stuart Mill was a great advocate of this    nice guy besides    and only been dead     years. So basis of utilitarianism    I'm sure you're familiar at least. The three people who voted for Mill before are familiar with this. But here's the way it works. What if morals  what if what makes something moral is just a matter of if it maximizes pleasure and minimizes pain  It does something intrinsic to the act. It's not like its relation to some abstract form. It's just a matter of the consequences. You just look at the consequences and see if  overall  it's for the good or for the worse. That would be simple. Then we know what to do. Let's take an example. Suppose I go up and I say   I'm going to take your phone.  Not just because it rang earlier  but I'm going to take it because I made a little calculation. I thought  that guy looks suspicious. And what if he's been sending little messages to Bin Laden's hideout    or whoever took over after Bin Laden    and he's actually like a terrorist  a sleeper cell. I'm going to find that out  and when I find that out  I'm going to prevent a huge amount of damage that he could cause. That has a very high utility to prevent that damage. And compared to the little pain that it's going to cause    because it's going to be embarrassing when I'm looking on his phone and seeing that he has a Farmville problem and that whole bit    that's overwhelmed by the value of looking at the phone. If you feel that way  that's a utilitarian choice. But maybe you don't feel that way either. Maybe you think  it's his phone. It's wrong to take his phone because he's a person and he has rights and he has dignity  and we can't just interfere with that. He has autonomy. It doesn't matter what the calculations are. There are things that are intrinsically wrong    like lying is wrong  like torturing innocent children is wrong. Kant was very good on this point  and he said it a little better than I'll say it. He said we should use our reason to figure out the rules by which we should guide our conduct  and then it is our duty to follow those rules. It's not a matter of calculation. So let's stop. We're right in the thick of it  this philosophical thicket. And this goes on for thousands of years  because these are hard questions  and I've only got    minutes. So let's cut to the chase. How should we be making our decisions  Is it Plato  is it Aristotle  is it Kant  is it Mill  What should we be doing  What's the answer  What's the formula that we can use in any situation to determine what we should do  whether we should use that guy's data or not  What's the formula  There's not a formula. There's not a simple answer. Ethics is hard. Ethics requires thinking. And that's uncomfortable. I know  I spent a lot of my career in artificial intelligence  trying to build machines that could do some of this thinking for us  that could give us answers. But they can't. You can't just take human thinking and put it into a machine. We're the ones who have to do it. Happily  we're not machines  and we can do it. Not only can we think  we must. Hannah Arendt said   The sad truth is that most evil done in this world is not done by people who choose to be evil. It arises from not thinking.  That's what she called the  banality of evil.  And the response to that is that we demand the exercise of thinking from every sane person. So let's do that. Let's think. In fact  let's start right now. Every person in this room do this  think of the last time you had a decision to make where you were worried to do the right thing  where you wondered   What should I be doing   Bring that to mind  and now reflect on that and say   How did I come up that decision  What did I do  Did I follow my gut  Did I have somebody vote on it  Or did I punt to legal   Or now we have a few more choices.  Did I evaluate what would be the highest pleasure like Mill would  Or like Kant  did I use reason to figure out what was intrinsically right   Think about it. Really bring it to mind. This is important. It is so important we are going to spend    seconds of valuable TEDTalk time doing nothing but thinking about this. Are you ready  Go. Stop. Good work. What you just did  that's the first step towards taking responsibility for what we should do with all of our power. Now the next step    try this. Go find a friend and explain to them how you made that decision. Not right now. Wait till I finish talking. Do it over lunch. And don't just find another technologist friend  find somebody different than you. Find an artist or a writer    or  heaven forbid  find a philosopher and talk to them. In fact  find somebody from the humanities. Why  Because they think about problems differently than we do as technologists. Just a few days ago  right across the street from here  there was hundreds of people gathered together. It was technologists and humanists at that big BiblioTech Conference. And they gathered together because the technologists wanted to learn what it would be like to think from a humanities perspective. You have someone from Google talking to someone who does comparative literature. You're thinking about the relevance of   th century French theater    how does that bear upon venture capital  Well that's interesting. That's a different way of thinking. And when you think in that way  you become more sensitive to the human considerations  which are crucial to making ethical decisions. So imagine that right now you went and you found your musician friend. And you're telling him what we're talking about  about our whole data revolution and all this    maybe even hum a few bars of our theme music.   Dum ta da da dum dum ta da da dum   Well  your musician friend will stop you and say   You know  the theme music for your data revolution  that's an opera  that's Wagner. It's based on Norse legend. It's Gods and mythical creatures fighting over magical jewelry.  That's interesting. Now it's also a beautiful opera  and we're moved by that opera. We're moved because it's about the battle between good and evil  about right and wrong. And we care about right and wrong. We care what happens in that opera. We care what happens in  Apocalypse Now.  And we certainly care what happens with our technologies. We have so much power today  it is up to us to figure out what to do  and that's the good news. We're the ones writing this opera. This is our movie. We figure out what will happen with this technology. We determine how this will all end. Thank you. When I was growing up in Montana  I had two dreams. I wanted to be a paleontologist  a dinosaur paleontologist  and I wanted to have a pet dinosaur. And so that's what I've been striving for all of my life. I was very fortunate early in my career. I was fortunate in finding things. I wasn't very good at reading things. In fact  I don't read much of anything. I am extremely dyslexic  and so reading is the hardest thing I do. But instead  I go out and I find things. Then I just pick things up. I basically practice for finding money on the street. And I wander about the hills  and I have found a few things. And I have been fortunate enough to find things like the first eggs in the Western hemisphere and the first baby dinosaurs in nests  the first dinosaur embryos and massive accumulations of bones. And it happened to be at a time when people were just starting to begin to realize that dinosaurs weren't the big  stupid  green reptiles that people had thought for so many years. People were starting to get an idea that dinosaurs were special. And so  at that time  I was able to make some interesting hypotheses along with my colleagues. We were able to actually say that dinosaurs    based on the evidence we had    that dinosaurs built nests and lived in colonies and cared for their young  brought food to their babies and traveled in gigantic herds. So it was pretty interesting stuff. I have gone on to find more things and discover that dinosaurs really were very social. We have found a lot of evidence that dinosaurs changed from when they were juveniles to when they were adults. The appearance of them would have been different    which it is in all social animals. In social groups of animals  the juveniles always look different than the adults. The adults can recognize the juveniles  the juveniles can recognize the adults. And so we're making a better picture of what a dinosaur looks like. And they didn't just all chase Jeeps around. But it is that social thing that I guess attracted Michael Crichton. And in his book  he talked about the social animals. And then Steven Spielberg  of course  depicts these dinosaurs as being very social creatures. The theme of this story is building a dinosaur  and so we come to that part of  Jurassic Park.  Michael Crichton really was one of the first people to talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life. You all know the story  right. I mean  I assume everyone here has seen  Jurassic Park.  If you want to make a dinosaur  you go out  you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap    otherwise known as amber    that has some blood sucking insects in it  good ones  and you get your insect and you drill into it and you suck out some DNA  because obviously all insects that sucked blood in those days sucked dinosaur DNA out. And you take your DNA back to the laboratory and you clone it. And I guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich egg  or something like that  and then you wait  and  lo and behold  out pops a little baby dinosaur. And everybody's happy about that. And they're happy over and over again. They keep doing it  they just keep making these things. And then  then  then  and then ... Then the dinosaurs  being social  act out their socialness  and they get together  and they conspire. And  of course  that's what makes Steven Spielberg's movie    conspiring dinosaurs chasing people around. So I assume everybody knows that if you actually had a piece of amber and it had an insect in it  and you drilled into it  and you got something out of that insect  and you cloned it  and you did it over and over and over again  you'd have a room full of mosquitos. And probably a whole bunch of trees as well. Now if you want dinosaur DNA  I say go to the dinosaur. So that's what we've done. Back in      when the movie came out  we actually had a grant from the National Science Foundation to attempt to extract DNA from a dinosaur  and we chose the dinosaur on the left  a Tyrannosaurus rex  which was a very nice specimen. And one of my former doctoral students  Dr. Mary Schweitzer  actually had the background to do this sort of thing. And so she looked into the bone of this T. rex  one of the thigh bones  and she actually found some very interesting structures in there. They found these red circular looking objects  and they looked  for all the world  like red blood cells. And they're in what appear to be the blood channels that go through the bone. And so she thought  well  what the heck. So she sampled some material out of it. Now it wasn't DNA  she didn't find DNA. But she did find heme  which is the biological foundation of hemoglobin. And that was really cool. That was interesting. That was    here we have    million year old heme. Well we tried and tried and we couldn't really get anything else out of it. So a few years went by  and then we started the Hell Creek Project. And the Hell Creek Project was this massive undertaking to get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find  and hopefully find some dinosaurs that had more material in them. And out in eastern Montana there's a lot of space  a lot of badlands  and not very many people  and so you can go out there and find a lot of stuff. And we did find a lot of stuff. We found a lot of Tyrannosaurs  but we found one special Tyrannosaur  and we called it B rex. And B rex was found under a thousand cubic yards of rock. It wasn't a very complete T. rex  and it wasn't a very big T. rex  but it was a very special B rex. And I and my colleagues cut into it  and we were able to determine  by looking at lines of arrested growth  some lines in it  that B rex had died at the age of   . We don't really know how long dinosaurs lived  because we haven't found the oldest one yet. But this one died at the age of   . We gave samples to Mary Schweitzer  and she was actually able to determine that B rex was a female based on medullary tissue found on the inside of the bone. Medullary tissue is the calcium build up  the calcium storage basically  when an animal is pregnant  when a bird is pregnant. So here was the character that linked birds and dinosaurs. But Mary went further. She took the bone  and she dumped it into acid. Now we all know that bones are fossilized  and so if you dump it into acid  there shouldn't be anything left. But there was something left. There were blood vessels left. There were flexible  clear blood vessels. And so here was the first soft tissue from a dinosaur. It was extraordinary. But she also found osteocytes  which are the cells that laid down the bones. And try and try  we could not find DNA  but she did find evidence of proteins. But we thought maybe    well  we thought maybe that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground. We thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast. And so we built a laboratory in the back of an    wheeler trailer  and actually took the laboratory to the field where we could get better samples. And we did. We got better material. The cells looked better. The vessels looked better. Found the protein collagen. I mean  it was wonderful stuff. But it's not dinosaur DNA. So we have discovered that dinosaur DNA  and all DNA  just breaks down too fast. We're just not going to be able to do what they did in  Jurassic Park.  We're not going to be able to make a dinosaur based on a dinosaur. But birds are dinosaurs. Birds are living dinosaurs. We actually classify them as dinosaurs. We now call them non avian dinosaurs and avian dinosaurs. So the non avian dinosaurs are the big clunky ones that went extinct. Avian dinosaurs are our modern birds. So we don't have to make a dinosaur because we already have them. I know  you're as bad as the sixth graders. The sixth graders look at it and they say   No.   You can call it a dinosaur  but look at the velociraptor  the velociraptor is cool.   The chicken is not.  So this is our problem  as you can imagine. The chicken is a dinosaur. I mean it really is. You can't argue with it because we're the classifiers and we've classified it that way. But the sixth graders demand it.  Fix the chicken.  So that's what I'm here to tell you about  how we are going to fix a chicken. So we have a number of ways that we actually can fix the chicken. Because evolution works  we actually have some evolutionary tools. We'll call them biological modification tools. We have selection. And we know selection works. We started out with a wolf like creature and we ended up with a Maltese. I mean  that's    that's definitely genetic modification. Or any of the other funny looking little dogs. We also have transgenesis. Transgenesis is really cool too. That's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one. That's how people make GloFish. You take a glow gene out of a coral or a jellyfish and you stick it in a zebrafish  and  puff  they glow. And that's pretty cool. And they obviously make a lot of money off of them. And now they're making Glow rabbits and Glow all sorts of things. I guess we could make a glow chicken. But I don't think that'll satisfy the sixth graders either. But there's another thing. There's what we call atavism activation. And atavism activation is basically    an atavism is an ancestral characteristic. You heard that occasionally children are born with tails  and it's because it's an ancestral characteristic. And so there are a number of atavisms that can happen. Snakes are occasionally born with legs. And here's an example. This is a chicken with teeth. A fellow by the name of Matthew Harris at the University of Wisconsin in Madison actually figured out a way to stimulate the gene for teeth  and so was able to actually turn the tooth gene on and produce teeth in chickens. Now that's a good characteristic. We can save that one. We know we can use that. We can make a chicken with teeth. That's getting closer. That's better than a glowing chicken. A friend of mine  a colleague of mine  Dr. Hans Larsson at McGill University  is actually looking at atavisms. And he's looking at them by looking at the embryo genesis of birds and actually looking at how they develop  and he's interested in how birds actually lost their tail. He's also interested in the transformation of the arm  the hand  to the wing. He's looking for those genes as well. And I said   Well  if you can find those  I can just reverse them and make what I need to make for the sixth graders.  And so he agreed. And so that's what we're looking into. If you look at dinosaur hands  a velociraptor has that cool looking hand with the claws on it. Archaeopteryx  which is a bird  a primitive bird  still has that very primitive hand. But as you can see  the pigeon  or a chicken or anything else  another bird  has kind of a weird looking hand  because the hand is a wing. But the cool thing is that  if you look in the embryo  as the embryo is developing the hand actually looks pretty much like the archaeopteryx hand. It has the three fingers  the three digits. But a gene turns on that actually fuses those together. And so what we're looking for is that gene. We want to stop that gene from turning on  fusing those hands together  so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three fingered hand  like the archaeopteryx. And the same goes for the tails. Birds have basically rudimentary tails. And so we know that in embryo  as the animal is developing  it actually has a relatively long tail. But a gene turns on and resorbs the tail  gets rid of it. So that's the other gene we're looking for. We want to stop that tail from resorbing. So what we're trying to do really is take our chicken  modify it and make the chickenosaurus. It's a cooler looking chicken. But it's just the very basics. So that really is what we're doing. And people always say   Why do that  Why make this thing  What good is it   Well  that's a good question. Actually  I think it's a great way to teach kids about evolutionary biology and developmental biology and all sorts of things. And quite frankly  I think if Colonel Sanders was to be careful how he worded it  he could actually advertise an extra piece. Anyway    When our dino chicken hatches  it will be  obviously  the poster child  or what you might call a poster chick  for technology  entertainment and design. Thank you. This story is about taking imagination seriously. Fourteen years ago  I first encountered this ordinary material  fishnet  used the same way for centuries. Today  I'm using it to create permanent  billowing  voluptuous forms the scale of hard edged buildings in cities around the world. I was an unlikely person to be doing this. I never studied sculpture  engineering or architecture. In fact  after college I applied to seven art schools and was rejected by all seven. I went off on my own to become an artist  and I painted for    years  when I was offered a Fulbright to India. Promising to give exhibitions of paintings  I shipped my paints and arrived in Mahabalipuram. The deadline for the show arrived    my paints didn't. I had to do something. This fishing village was famous for sculpture. So I tried bronze casting. But to make large forms was too heavy and expensive. I went for a walk on the beach  watching the fishermen bundle their nets into mounds on the sand. I'd seen it every day  but this time I saw it differently    a new approach to sculpture  a way to make volumetric form without heavy solid materials. My first satisfying sculpture was made in collaboration with these fishermen. It's a self portrait titled  Wide Hips.  We hoisted them on poles to photograph. I discovered their soft surfaces revealed every ripple of wind in constantly changing patterns. I was mesmerized. I continued studying craft traditions and collaborating with artisans  next in Lithuania with lace makers. I liked the fine detail it gave my work  but I wanted to make them larger    to shift from being an object you look at to something you could get lost in. Returning to India to work with those fishermen  we made a net of a million and a half hand tied knots    installed briefly in Madrid. Thousands of people saw it  and one of them was the urbanist Manual Sola Morales who was redesigning the waterfront in Porto  Portugal. He asked if I could build this as a permanent piece for the city. I didn't know if I could do that and preserve my art. Durable  engineered  permanent    those are in opposition to idiosyncratic  delicate and ephemeral. For two years  I searched for a fiber that could survive ultraviolet rays  salt  air  pollution  and at the same time remain soft enough to move fluidly in the wind. We needed something to hold the net up out there in the middle of the traffic circle. So we raised this        pound steel ring. We had to engineer it to move gracefully in an average breeze and survive in hurricane winds. But there was no engineering software to model something porous and moving. I found a brilliant aeronautical engineer who designs sails for America's Cup racing yachts named Peter Heppel. He helped me tackle the twin challenges of precise shape and gentle movement. I couldn't build this the way I knew because hand tied knots weren't going to withstand a hurricane. So I developed a relationship with an industrial fishnet factory  learned the variables of their machines  and figured out a way to make lace with them. There was no language to translate this ancient  idiosyncratic handcraft into something machine operators could produce. So we had to create one. Three years and two children later  we raised this        square foot lace net. It was hard to believe that what I had imagined was now built  permanent and had lost nothing in translation. This intersection had been bland and anonymous. Now it had a sense of place. I walked underneath it for the first time. As I watched the wind's choreography unfold  I felt sheltered and  at the same time  connected to limitless sky. My life was not going to be the same. I want to create these oases of sculpture in spaces of cities around the world. I'm going to share two directions that are new in my work. Historic Philadelphia City Hall  its plaza  I felt  needed a material for sculpture that was lighter than netting. So we experimented with tiny atomized water particles to create a dry mist that is shaped by the wind and in testing  discovered that it can be shaped by people who can interact and move through it without getting wet. I'm using this sculpture material to trace the paths of subway trains above ground in real time    like an X ray of the city's circulatory system unfolding. Next challenge  the Biennial of the Americas in Denver asked  could I represent the    nations of the Western hemisphere and their interconnectedness in a sculpture  I didn't know where to begin  but I said yes. I read about the recent earthquake in Chile and the tsunami that rippled across the entire Pacific Ocean. It shifted the Earth's tectonic plates  sped up the planet's rotation and literally shortened the length of the day. So I contacted NOAA  and I asked if they'd share their data on the tsunami  and translated it into this. Its title    .    refers to the number of microseconds that the Earth's day was shortened. I couldn't build this with a steel ring  the way I knew. Its shape was too complex now. So I replaced the metal armature with a soft  fine mesh of a fiber    times stronger than steel. The sculpture could now be entirely soft  which made it so light it could tie in to existing buildings    literally becoming part of the fabric of the city. There was no software that could extrude these complex net forms and model them with gravity. So we had to create it. Then I got a call from New York City asking if I could adapt these concepts to Times Square or the High Line. This new soft structural method enables me to model these and build these sculptures at the scale of skyscrapers. They don't have funding yet  but I dream now of bringing these to cities around the world where they're most needed. Fourteen years ago  I searched for beauty in the traditional things  in craft forms. Now I combine them with hi tech materials and engineering to create voluptuous  billowing forms the scale of buildings. My artistic horizons continue to grow. I'll leave you with this story. I got a call from a friend in Phoenix. An attorney in the office who'd never been interested in art  never visited the local art museum  dragged everyone she could from the building and got them outside to lie down underneath the sculpture. There they were in their business suits  laying in the grass  noticing the changing patterns of wind beside people they didn't know  sharing the rediscovery of wonder. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. In       I decided that we needed to reconceptualize how we thought about economic development. Our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work  they should be able to choose between at least a handful of different cities that were all competing to attract new residents. Now we're a long way away from that goal right now. There are billions of people in developing countries who don't have even a single city that would be willing to welcome them. But the amazing thing about cities is they're worth so much more than it costs to build them. So we could easily supply the world with dozens  maybe hundreds  of new cities. Now this might sound preposterous to you if you've never thought about new cities. But just substitute apartment building for cities. Imagine half the people who wanted to be in apartments already had them  the other half aren't there yet. You could try and expand the capacity by doing additions on all the existing apartments. But you know what you'd run into is those apartments and the surrounding areas have rules to avoid discomfort and the distractions of construction. So it's extremely hard to do all of those additions. But you could go out someplace brand new  build a brand new apartment building  as long as the rules there were ones that facilitated construction rather than getting in the way. So I proposed that governments create new reform zones big enough to hold cities and gave them a name  charter cities. Later I learned that at about this same time  Javier and Octavio were thinking about the challenge of reform in Honduras. They knew that about        Hondurans every year would leave to go to the United States  and they wanted to ask  what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do the same things in Honduras. At one point  Javier said to Octavio   What if we took some of our empty land    what if we just gave it to an embassy    give some to the U.S. embassy  give some to the Canadian embassy    and then if people want to go work under the rules of Canada or under the rules of the United States  they can go get jobs  do everything they do on those embassy grounds that they would otherwise have to go to Canada or the U.S. to do   In the summer of       Honduras went through a wrenching constitutional crisis. At the next regularly scheduled election  Pepe Lobo won in a landslide on a platform that promised reform  but reconciliation as well. He asked Octavio to be his chief of staff. Meanwhile  I was getting ready to give a talk at TEDGlobal. Through a process of refinement  trial and error  a lot of user testing  I tried to boil this complicated concept of charter city down to the bare essentials. The first point was the importance of rules  like those rules that say you can't come in and disturb all the existing apartment holders. We pay a lot of attention to new technologies  but it takes technologies and rules to get progress  and it's usually the rules that hold us back. In the fall of       a friend from Guatemala sent Octavio a link to the TEDTalk. He showed it to Javier. They called me. They said   Let's present this to the leaders of our country.  So in December we met in Miami  in a hotel conference room. I tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are  how much more valuable they are than they cost. And I used this slide showing how valuable the raw land is in a place like New York City  notice  land that's worth thousands of dollars  in some cases  per square meter. But it was a fairly abstract discussion  and at some point when there was a pause  Octavio said   Paul  maybe we could watch the TEDTalk.  So the TEDTalk laid out in very simple terms  a charter city is a place where you start with uninhabited land  a charter that specifies the rules that will apply there and then a chance for people to opt in  to go live under those rules or not. So I was asked by the president of Honduras who said that we need to do this project  this is important  this could be the way forward for our country. I was asked to come to Tegucigalpa and talk again on January fourth and fifth. So I presented another fact filled lecture that included a slide like this  which tried to make the point that  if you want to create a lot of value in a city  it has to be very big. This is a picture of Denver  and the outline is the new airport that was built in Denver. This airport alone covers more than     square kilometers. So I was trying to persuade the Hondurans  if you build a new city  you've got to start with a site that's at least       square kilometers. That's more than     hundred thousand acres. Everybody applauded politely. The faces in the audience were very serious and attentive. The leader of the congress came up on stage and said   Professor Romer  thank you very much for your lecture  but maybe we could watch the TEDTalk. I've got it here on my laptop.  So I sat down  and they played the TEDTalk. And it got to the essence  which is that a new city could offer new choices for people. There would be a choice of a city which you could go to which could be in Honduras  instead of hundreds of miles away in the North. And it also involved new choices for leaders. Because the leaders in the government there in Honduras would need help from partner countries  who could benefit from partner countries who help them set up the rules in this charter and the enforcement  so everybody can trust that the charter really will be enforced. And the insight of President Lobo was that that assurance of enforcement that I was thinking about as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build the city could be equally important for all the different parties in Honduras who had suffered for so many years from fear and distrust. We went and looked at a site. This picture's from there. It easily could hold a thousand square kilometers. And shortly thereafter  on January   th  they voted in the congress to amend their constitution to have a constitutional provision that allows for special development regions. In a country which had just gone through this wrenching crisis  the vote in the congress in favor of this constitutional amendment was     to one. All parties  all factions in society  backed this. To be part of the constitution  you actually have to pass it twice in the congress. On February   th they passed it again with another vote of     to one. Immediately after that vote  on February   st to the   th  a delegation of about    Hondurans went to the two places in the world that are most interested in getting into the city building business. One is South Korea. This is a picture of a big  new city center that's being built in South Korea    bigger than downtown Boston. Everything you see there was built in four years  after they spent four years getting the permits. The other place that's very interested in city building is Singapore. They've actually built two cities already in China and are preparing the third. So if you think about this practically  here's where we are. They've got a site  they're already thinking about this site for the second city. They're putting in place a legal system that could allow for managers to come in  and also an external legal system. One country has already volunteered to let its supreme court be the court of final appeal for the new judicial system there. There's designers and builders of cities who are very interested. They even can bring with them some financing. But the one thing you know they've already solved is that there's lots of tenants. There's lots of businesses that would like to locate in the Americas  especially in a place with a free trade zone  and there's lots of people who'd like to go there. Around the world  there's     million people who say they'd like to move permanently someplace else right now. There's a million a year who leave Latin America to go to the United States. Many of these are a father who has to leave his family behind to go get a job    sometimes a single mother who has to get enough money to even pay for food or clothing. Sadly  sometimes there are even children who are trying to get reunited with their parents that they haven't seen  in some cases  for a decade. So what kind of an idea is it to think about building a brand new city in Honduras  Or to build a dozen of these  or a hundred of these  around the world  What kind of an idea is it to think about insisting that every family have a choice of several cities that are competing to attract new residents  This is an idea worth spreading. And my friends from Honduras asked me to say thank you  TED. I want you to imagine two couples in the middle of      on the exact same day  at the exact same moment  each conceiving a baby    okay  So two couples each conceiving one baby. Now I don't want you to spend too much time imagining the conception  because if you spend all that time imagining that conception  you're not going to listen to me. So just imagine that for a moment. And in this scenario  I want to imagine that  in one case  the sperm is carrying a Y chromosome  meeting that X chromosome of the egg. And in the other case  the sperm is carrying an X chromosome  meeting the X chromosome of the egg. Both are viable  both take off. We'll come back to these people later. So I wear two hats in most of what I do. As the one hat  I do history of anatomy. I'm a historian by training  and what I study in that case is the way that people have dealt with anatomy    meaning human bodies  animal bodies    how they dealt with bodily fluids  concepts of bodies  how have they thought about bodies. The other hat that I've worn in my work is as an activist  as a patient advocate    or  as I sometimes say  as an impatient advocate    for people who are patients of doctors. In that case  what I've worked with is people who have body types that challenge social norms. So some of what I've worked on  for example  is people who are conjoined twins    two people within one body. Some of what I've worked on is people who have dwarfism    so people who are much shorter than typical. And a lot of what I've worked on is people who have atypical sex    so people who don't have the standard male or the standard female body types. And as a general term  we can use the term intersex for this. Intersex comes in a lot of different forms. I'll just give you a few examples of the types of ways you can have sex that isn't standard for male or female. So in one instance  you can have somebody who has an XY chromosomal basis  and that SRY gene on the Y chromosome tells the proto gonads  which we all have in the fetal life  to become testes. And so in the fetal life the testes are pumping out testosterone. But because this individual lacks receptors to hear that testosterone  the body doesn't react to the testosterone. And this is a syndrome called androgen insensitivity syndrome. So lots of levels of testosterone  but no reaction to it. As a consequence  the body develops more along the female typical path. When the child is born  she looks like a girl. She is a girl. She is raised as a girl. And it's often not until she hits puberty and she's growing and developing breasts  but she's not getting her period  that somebody figures out something's up here. And they do some tests and figure out that  instead of having ovaries inside and a uterus  she actually has testes inside  and she has a Y chromosome. Now what's important to understand is you may think of this person as really being male  but they're really not. Females  like males  have in our bodies something called the adrenal glands. They're in the back of our body. And the adrenal glands make androgens  which are a masculinizing hormone. Most females like me    I believe myself to be a typical female    I don't actually know my chromosomal make up but I think I'm probably typical    most females like me are actually androgen sensitive. We're making androgen  and we're responding to androgens. The consequence is that somebody like me has actually had a brain exposed to more androgens than the woman born with testes who has androgen insensitivity syndrome. So sex is really complicated  it's not just that intersex people are in the middle of all the sex spectrum    in some ways  they can be all over the place. Another example  a few years ago I got a call from a man who was    years old  who was born a boy  raised a boy  had a girlfriend  had sex with his girlfriend  had a life as a guy and had just found out that he had ovaries and a uterus inside. What he had was an extreme form of a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia. He had XX chromosomes  and in the womb  his adrenal glands were in such high gear that it created  essentially  a masculine hormonal environment. And as a consequence  his genitals were masculinzed  his brain was subject to the more typical masculine component of hormones. And he was born looking like a boy    nobody suspected anything. And it was only when he had reached the age of    that he began to have enough medical problems actually from menstruating internally  that doctors figured out that  in fact  he was female internally. Okay  so just one more quick example of a way you can have intersex. Some people who have XX chromosomes develop what are called ovotestis  which is when you have ovarian tissue with testicular tissue wrapped around it. And we're not exactly sure why that happens. So sex can come in lots of different varieties. The reason that children with these kinds of bodies    whether it's dwarfism  or it's conjoined twinning  or it's an intersex type    are often normalized by surgeons is not because it actually leaves them better off in terms of physical health. In many cases  people are actually perfectly healthy. The reason they're often subject to various kinds of surgeries is because they threaten our social categories. Or system has been based typically on the idea that a particular kind of anatomy comes with a particular identity. So we have the concept that what it means to be a woman is to have a female identity  what it means to be a black person is  allegedly  is to have an African anatomy in terms of your history. And so we have this terribly simplistic idea. And when we're faced with a body that actually presents us something quite different  it startles us in terms of those categorizations. So we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture about individualism. And our nation's really founded on a very romantic concept of individualism. Well you can imagine how startling then it is when you have children that are born who are two people inside of one body. Where I ran into the most heat from this most recently was last year the South African runner  Caster Semenya  had her sex called into question at the International Games in Berlin. I had a lot of journalists calling me  asking me   Which is the test they're going to run that will tell us whether or not Caster Semenya is male or female   And I had to explain to the journalists there isn't such a test. In fact  we now know that sex is complicated enough that we have to admit nature doesn't draw the line for us between male and female  or between male and intersex and female and intersex  we actually draw that line on nature. So what we have is a sort of situation where the farther our science goes  the more we have to admit to ourselves that these categories that we thought of as stable anatomical categories that mapped very simply to stable identity categories are a lot more fuzzy than we thought. And it's not just in terms of sex. It's also in terms of race  which turns out to be vastly more complicated than our terminology has allowed. As we look  we get into all sorts of uncomfortable areas. We look  for example  about the fact that we share at least    percent of our DNA with chimpanzees. What are we to make of the fact that we differ from them only really by a few nucleotides  And as we get farther and farther with our science  we get more and more into a discomforted zone where we have to acknowledge that the simplistic categories we've had are probably overly simplistic. So we're seeing this in all sorts of places in human life. One of the places we're seeing it  for example  in our culture today  in the United States today  is battles over the beginning of life and the end of life. We have difficult conversations about at what point we decide a body becomes a human  such that it has a different right than a fetal life. We have very difficult conversations nowadays    probably not out in the open as much as within medicine    about the question of when somebody's dead. In the past  our ancestors never had to struggle so much with this question of when somebody was dead. At most  they'd stick a feather on somebody's nose  and if it twitched  they didn't bury them yet. If it stopped twitching  you bury them. But today  we have a situation where we want to take vital organs out of beings and give them to other beings. And as a consequence  we're stuck with having to struggle with this really difficult question about who's dead  and this leads us to a really difficult situation where we don't have such simple categories as we've had before. Now you might think that all this breaking down of categories would make somebody like me really happy. I'm a political progressive  I defend people with unusual bodies  but I have to admit to you that it makes me nervous. Understanding that these categories are really much more unstable than we thought makes me tense. And it makes me tense from the point of view of thinking about democracy. So in order to tell you about that tension  I have to first admit to you that I'm a huge fan of the Founding Fathers. I know they were racists  I know they were sexist  but they were great. I mean  they were so brave and so bold and so radical in what they did that I find myself watching that cheesy musical        every few years  and it's not because of the music  which is totally forgettable. It's because of what happened in      with the Founding Fathers. The Founding Fathers were  for my point of view  the original anatomical activists  and this is why. What they rejected was an anatomical concept and replaced it with another one that was radical and beautiful and held us for     years. So as you all recall  what our Founding Fathers were rejecting was a concept of monarchy  and the monarchy was basically based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy. The monarchs of the old world didn't have a concept of DNA  but they did have a concept of birthright. They had a concept of blue blood. They had the idea that the people who would be in political power should be in political power because of the blood being passed down from grandfather to father to son and so forth. The Founding Fathers rejected that idea  and they replaced it with a new anatomical concept  and that concept was all men are created equal. They leveled that playing field and decided the anatomy that mattered was the commonality of anatomy  not the difference in anatomy  and that was a really radical thing to do. Now they were doing it in part because they were part of an Enlightenment system where two things were growing up together. And that was democracy growing up  but it was also science growing up at the same time. And it's really clear  if you look at the history of the Founding Fathers  a lot of them were very interested in science  and they were interested in a concept of a naturalistic world. They were moving away from supernatural explanations  and they were rejecting things like a supernatural concept of power  where it transmitted because of a very vague concept of birthright. They were moving towards a naturalistic concept. And if you look  for example  in the Declaration of Independence  they talk about nature and nature's God. They don't talk about God and God's nature. They're talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are. So as part of that  they were coming to us with a concept that was about anatomical commonality. And in doing so  they were really setting up in a beautiful way the Civil Rights movement of the future. They didn't think of it that way  but they did it for us  and it was great. So what happened years afterward  What happened was women  for example  who wanted the right to vote  took the Founding Fathers' concept of anatomical commonality being more important than anatomical difference and said   The fact that we have a uterus and ovaries is not significant enough in terms of a difference to mean that we shouldn't have the right to vote  the right to full citizenship  the right to own property  etc.  etc.  And women successfully argued that. Next came the successful Civil Rights movement  where we found people like Sojourner Truth talking about   Ain't I a woman   We find men on the marching lines of the Civil Rights movement saying   I am a man.  Again  people of color appealing to a commonality of anatomy over a difference of anatomy  again  successfully. We see the same thing with the disability rights movement. The problem is  of course  that  as we begin to look at all that commonality  we have to begin to question why we maintain certain divisions. Now mind you  I want to maintain some divisions  anatomically  in our culture. For example  I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human. I don't want to say we give up entirely on anatomy. I don't want to say five year olds should be allowed to consent to sex or consent to marry. So there are some anatomical divisions that make sense to me and that I think we should retain. But the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are and why do we retain them and do they have meaning. So let's go back to those two beings conceived at the beginning of this talk. We have two beings  both conceived in the middle of      on the exact same day. Let's imagine one of them  Mary  is born three months prematurely  so she's born on June        . Henry  by contrast  is born at term  so he's born on March        . Simply by virtue of the fact that Mary was born prematurely three months  she comes into all sorts of rights three months earlier than Henry does    the right to consent to sex  the right to vote  the right to drink. Henry has to wait for all of that  not because he's actually any different in age  biologically  except in terms of when he was born. We find other kinds of weirdness in terms of what their rights are. Henry  by virtue of being assumed to be male    although I haven't told you that he's the XY one    by virtue of being assumed to be male is now liable to be drafted  which Mary does not need to worry about. Mary  meanwhile  cannot in all the states have the same right that Henry has in all the states  namely  the right to marry. Henry can marry in every state a woman  but Mary can only marry today in a few states a woman. So we have these anatomical categories that persist that are in many ways problematic and questionable. And the question to me becomes  What do we do  as our science gets to be so good in looking at anatomy  that we reach the point where we have to admit that a democracy that's been based on anatomy might start falling apart  I don't want to give up the science  but at the same time it kind of feels sometimes like the science is coming out from under us. So where do we go  It seems like what happens in our culture is a sort of pragmatic attitude   Well  we have to draw the line somewhere  so we will draw the line somewhere.  But a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position. So for example  Texas has at one point decided that what it means to marry a man is to mean that you don't have a Y chromosome  and what it means to marry a woman means you do have a Y chromosome. Now in practice they don't actually test people for their chromosomes. But this is also very bizarre  because of the story I told you at the beginning about androgen insensitivity syndrome. If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy  Dr. Martin Luther King  he offers us something of a solution in his  I have a dream  speech. He says we should judge people  based not on the color of their skin  but on the content of their character   moving beyond anatomy. And I want to say   Yeah  that sounds like a really good idea.  But in practice  how do you do it  How do you judge people based on the content of character  I also want to point out that I'm not sure that is how we should distribute rights in terms of humans  because  I have to admit  that there are some golden retrievers I know that are probably more deserving of social services than some humans I know. I also want to say there are probably also some yellow Labradors that I know that are more capable of informed  intelligent  mature decisions about sexual relations than some    year olds that I know. So how do we operationalize the question of content of character  It turns out to be really difficult. And part of me also wonders  what if content of character turns out to be something that's scannable in the future    able to be seen with an fMRI  Do we really want to go there  I'm not sure where we go. What I do know is that it seems to be really important to think about the idea of the United States being in the lead of thinking about this issue of democracy. We've done a really good job struggling with democracy  and I think we would do a good job in the future. We don't have a situation that Iran has  for example  where a man who's sexually attracted to other men is liable to be murdered  unless he's willing to submit to a sex change  in which case he's allowed to live. We don't have that kind of situation. I'm glad to say we don't have the kind of situation with    a surgeon I talked to a few years ago who had brought over a set of conjoined twins in order to separate them  partly to make a name for himself. But when I was on the phone with him  asking why he was going to do this surgery    this was a very high risk surgery    his answer was that  in this other nation  these children were going to be treated very badly  and so he had to do this. My response to him was   Well  have you considered political asylum instead of a separation surgery   The United States has offered tremendous possibility for allowing people to be the way they are  without having them have to be changed for the sake of the state. So I think we have to be in the lead. Well  just to close  I want to suggest to you that I've been talking a lot about the fathers. And I want to think about the possibilities of what democracy might look like  or might have looked like  if we had more involved the mothers. And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist  and that is that I think that there may be different kinds of insights that can come from different kinds of anatomies  particularly when we have people thinking in groups. Now for years  because I've been interested in intersex  I've also been interested in sex difference research. And one of the things that I've been really interested in is looking at the differences between males and females in terms of the way they think and operate in the world. And what we know from cross cultural studies is that females  on average    not everyone  but on average    are more inclined to be very attentive to complex social relations and to taking care of people who are basically vulnerable within the group. And so if we think about that  we have an interesting situation on our hands. Years ago  when I was in graduate school  one of my graduate advisers who knew I was interested in feminism    I considered myself a feminist  as I still do    asked a really strange question. He said   Tell me what's feminine about feminism.  And I thought   Well that's the dumbest question I've ever heard. Feminism is all about undoing stereotypes about gender  so there's nothing feminine about feminism.  But the more I thought about his question  the more I thought there might be something feminine about feminism. That is to say  there might be something  on average  different about female brains from male brains that makes us more attentive to deeply complex social relationships and more attentive to taking care of the vulnerable. So whereas the fathers were extremely attentive to figuring out how to protect individuals from the state  it's possible that if we injected more mothers into this concept  what we would have is more of a concept of  not just how to protect  but how to care for each other. And maybe that's where we need to go in the future  when we take democracy beyond anatomy  is to think less about the individual body  in terms of the identity  and think more about those relationships. So that as we the people try to create a more perfect union  we're thinking about what we do for each other. Thank you. From all outward appearances  John had everything going for him. He had just signed the contract to sell his New York apartment at a six figure profit  and he'd only owned it for five years. The school where he graduated from with his master's had just offered him a teaching appointment  which meant not only a salary  but benefits for the first time in ages. And yet  despite everything going really well for John  he was struggling  fighting addiction and a gripping depression. On the night of June   th        he climbed up to the edge of the fence on the Manhattan Bridge and he leaped to the treacherous waters below. Remarkably    no  miraculously    he lived. The fall shattered his right arm  broke every rib that he had  punctured his lung  and he drifted in and out of consciousness as he drifted down the East River  under the Brooklyn Bridge and out into the pathway of the Staten Island Ferry  where passengers on the ferry heard his cries of pain  contacted the boat's captain who contacted the Coast Guard who fished him out of the East River and took him to Bellevue Hospital. And that's actually where our story begins. Because once John committed himself to putting his life back together    first physically  then emotionally  and then spiritually    he found that there were very few resources available to someone who has attempted to end their life in the way that he did. Research shows that    out of    people who attempt suicide will fail. But the people who fail are    times more likely to succeed the second time. This truly is an at risk population with very few resources to support them. And what happens when people try to assemble themselves back into life  because of our taboos around suicide  we're not sure what to say  and so quite often we say nothing. And that furthers the isolation that people like John found themselves in. I know John's story very well because I'm John. And this is  today  the first time in any sort of public setting I've ever acknowledged the journey that I have been on. But after having lost a beloved teacher in      and a good friend last year to suicide  and sitting last year at TEDActive  I knew that I needed to step out of my silence and past my taboos to talk about an idea worth spreading    and that is that people who have made the difficult choice to come back to life need more resources and need our help. As the Trevor Project says  it gets better. It gets way better. And I'm choosing to come out of a totally different kind of closet today to encourage you  to urge you  that if you are someone who has contemplated or attempted suicide  or you know somebody who has  talk about it  get help. It's a conversation worth having and an idea worth spreading. Thank you. A couple of years ago when I was attending the TED Conference in Long Beach  I met Harriet. We'd actually met online before    not the way you're thinking. We were actually introduced because we both knew Linda Avey  one of the founders of the first online personal genomic companies. And because we shared our genetic information with Linda  she could see that Harriet and I shared a very rare type of mitochondrial DNA    Haplotype K a b a    which meant that we were distantly related. We actually share the same genealogy with Ozzie the iceman. So Ozzie  Harriet and me. And being the current day  of course  we started our own Facebook group. You're all welcome to join. And when I met Harriet in person the next year at the TED Conference  she'd gone online and ordered our own happy Haplotype T shirts. Now why am I telling you this story  and what does this have to do with the future of health  Well the way I met Harriet is actually an example of how leveraging cross disciplinary  exponentially growing technologies is affecting our future of health and wellness    from low cost gene analysis to the ability to do powerful bio informatics to the connection of the Internet and social networking. What I'd like to talk about today is understanding these exponential technologies. We often think linearly. But if you think about it  if you have a lily pad and it just divided every single day    two  four  eight        in    days you have       . What do you think you have in a month  We're at a billion. So if we start to think exponentially  we can see how this is starting to affect all the technologies around us. And many of these technologies    speaking as a physician and innovator    we can really start to leverage to impact the future of our own health and of health care  and to address many of the major challenges that we have in health care today  ranging from the really exponential costs to the aging population  the way we really don't use information very well today  the fragmentation of care and often the very difficult course of adoption of innovation. And one of the major things we can do we've talked a bit about here today is moving the curve to the left. We spend most of our money on the last    percent of life. What if we could spend and incentivize positions in the health care system and our own self to move the curve to the left and improve our health  leveraging technology as well  Now my favorite technology  example of exponential technology  we all have in our pocket. So if you think about it  these are really dramatically improving. I mean this is the iPhone  . Imagine what the iPhone   will be able to do. Now  I've gained some insight into this. I've been the track share for the medicine portion of a new institution called Singularity University based in Silicon Valley. And we bring together every summer about     very talented students from around the world. And we look at these exponential technologies from medicine  biotech  artificial intelligence  robotics  nanotechnology  space  and address how can we cross train and leverage these to impact major unmet goals. We also have seven day executive programs. And coming up next month is actually Future Med  a program to help cross train and leverage technologies into medicine. Now I mentioned the phone. These mobile phones have over        different mobile apps available    to the point where there's one out of the U.K. where you can pee on a little chip connected to your iPhone and check yourself for an STD. I don't know if I'd try that yet  but that's available. There are all other sorts of applications  merging your phone and diagnostics  for example    measuring your blood glucose on your iPhone and sending that  potentially  to your physician so they can better understand and you can better understand your blood sugars as a diabetic. So let's see now how exponential technologies are taking health care. Let's start with faster. Well it's no secret that computers  through Moore's law  are speeding up faster and faster. We have the ability to do more powerful things with them. They're really approaching  in many cases surpassing  the ability of the human mind. But where I think computational speed is most applicable is in that of imaging. The ability now to look inside the body in real time with very high resolution is really becoming incredible. And we're layering multiple technologies    PET scans  CT scans and molecular diagnostics    to find and to seek things at different levels. Here you're going to see the very highest resolution MRI scan done today  reconstructed of Marc Hodosh  the curator of TEDMED. And now we can see inside of the brain with a resolution and ability that was never before available  and essentially learn how to reconstruct  and maybe even re engineer  or backwards engineer  the brain so we can better understand pathology  disease and therapy. We can look inside with real time fMRI    in the brain at real time. And by understanding these sorts of processes and these sorts of connections  we're going to understand the effects of medication or meditation and better personalize and make effective  for example  psychoactive drugs. The scanners for these are getting small  less expensive and more portable. And this sort of data explosion available from these is really almost becoming a challenge. The scan of today takes up about     books  or    gigabytes. The scan in a couple of years will be one terabyte  or         books. How do you leverage that information  Let's get personal. I won't ask who here's had a colonoscopy  but if you're over age     it's time for your screening colonoscopy. How would you like to avoid the pointy end of the stick  Well now there's essentially a virtual colonoscopy. Compare those two pictures  and now as a radiologist  you can essentially fly through your patient's colon and  augmenting that with artificial intelligence  identify potentially  as you see here  a lesion. Oh  we might have missed it  but using A.I. on top of radiology  we can find lesions that were missed before. And maybe this will encourage people to get colonoscopies that wouldn't have otherwise. And this is an example of this paradigm shift. We're moving to this integration of biomedicine  information technology  wireless and  I would say  mobile now    this era of digital medicine. So even my stethoscope is now digital. And of course  there's an app for that. We're moving  obviously  to the era of the tricorder. So the handheld ultrasound is basically surpassing and supplanting the stethoscope. These are now at a price point of    what used to be         euros or a couple of hundred thousand dollars    for about       dollars  I can have the power of a very powerful diagnostic device in my hand. And merging this now with the advent of electronic medical records    in the United States  we're still less than    percent electronic. Here in the Netherlands  I think it's more than    percent. But now that we're switching to merging medical data  making it available electronically  we can crowd source that information  and now as a physician  I can access my patients' data from wherever I am just through my mobile device. And now  of course  we're in the era of the iPad  even the iPad  . And just last month the first FDA approved application was approved to allow radiologists to do actual reading on these sorts of devices. So certainly  the physicians of today  including myself  are completely reliable on these devices. And as you saw just about a month ago  Watson from IBM beat the two champions in  Jeopardy.  So I want you to imagine when in a couple of years  when we've started to apply this cloud based information  when we really have the A.I. physician and leverage our brains to connectivity to make decisions and diagnostics at a level never done. Already today  you don't need to go to your physician in many cases. Only for about    percent of actual visits do you have to lay hands on the patient. We're now in the era of virtual visits    from sort of the Skype type visits you can do with American Well  to Cisco that's developed a very complex health presence system. The ability to interact with your health care provider is different. And these are being augmented even by our devices again today. Here my friend Jessica sent me a picture of her head laceration so I can save her a trip to the emergency room    I can do some diagnostics that way. Or might we be able to leverage today's gaming technology  like the Microsoft Kinect  and hack that to enable diagnostics  for example  in diagnosing stroke  using simple motion detection  using hundred dollar devices. We can actually now visit our patients robotically    this is the RP   if I'm a hematologist  visit another clinic  visit a hospital. These will be augmented by a whole suite of tools actually in the home now. So imagine we already have wireless scales. You can step on the scale. You can Tweet your weight to your friends  and they can keep you in line. We have wireless blood pressure cuffs. A whole gamut of these technologies are being put together. So instead of wearing these kludgy devices  we can put on a simple patch. This was developed by colleagues at Stanford  called the iRhythm    completely supplants the prior technology at a much lower price point with much more effectivity. Now we're also in the era  today  of quantified self. Consumers now can buy basically hundred dollar devices  like this little FitBit. I can measure my steps  my caloric outtake. I can get insight into that on a daily basis. I can share that with my friends  with my physician. There's watches coming out that will measure your heart rate  the Zeo sleep monitors  a whole suite of tools that can enable you to leverage and have insight into your own health. And as we start to integrate this information  we're going to know better what to do with it and how better to have insight into our own pathologies  health and wellness. There's even mirrors today that can pick up your pulse rate. And I would argue  in the future  we'll have wearable devices in our clothes  monitoring ourselves     . And just like we have the OnStar system in cars  your red light might go on    it won't say  check engine  though. It's going to be  check your body  light  and go in and get it taken care of. Probably in a few years  you'll check into your mirror and it's going to be diagnosing you. For those of you with kiddos at home  how would you like to have the wireless diaper that supports your ... too much information  I think  than you might need. But it's going to be here. Now we've heard a lot today about new technology and connection. And I think some of these technologies will enable us to be more connected with our patients  and take more time and actually do the important human touch elements of medicine  as augmented by these sorts of technologies. Now we've talked about augmenting the patient  to some degree. How about augmenting the physician  We're now in the era of super enabling the surgeon who can now go inside the body and do things with robotic surgery  which is here today  at a level that was not really possible even five years ago. Now this is being augmented with further layers of technology like augmented reality. So the surgeon can see inside the patient  through their lens  where the tumor is  where the blood vessels are. This can be integrated with decisions support. A surgeon in New York can be helping a surgeon in Amsterdam  for example. And we're entering an era of really  truly scarless surgery called NOTES  where the robotic endoscope can come out the stomach and pull out that gallbladder all in a scarless way and robotically. And this is called NOTES  and this is coming    basically scarless surgery  as mediated by robotic surgery. Now how about controlling other elements  For those who have disabilities    the paraplegic    there's the era of brain computer interface  or BCI  where chips have been put on the motor cortex of completely quadriplegic patients and they can control a curser or a wheelchair or  eventually  a robotic arm. And these devices are getting smaller and going into more and more of these patients. Still in clinical trials  but imagine when we can connect these  for example  to the amazing bionic limb  such as the DEKA Arm built by Dean Kamen and colleagues  which has    degrees of motion and freedom and can allow the person who's lost a limb to have much higher levels of dexterity or control than they've had in the past. So we're really entering the era of wearable robotics actually. If you haven't lost a limb    you've had a stroke  for example    you can wear these augmented limbs. Or if you're a paraplegic    like I've visited the folks at Berkley Bionics    they've developed eLEGS. I took this video last week. Here's a paraplegic patient actually walking by strapping on these exoskeletons. He's otherwise completely wheelchair bound. And now this is the early era of wearable robotics. And I think by leveraging these sorts of technologies  we're going to change the definition of disability to in some cases be superability  or super enabling. This is Aimee Mullins  who lost her lower limbs as a young child  and Hugh Herr  who's a professor at MIT who lost his limbs in a climbing accident. And now both of these can climb better  move faster  swim differently with their prosthetics than us normal abled persons. Now how about other exponentials  Clearly the obesity trend is exponentially going in the wrong direction  including with huge costs. But the trend in medicine actually is to get exponentially smaller. So a few examples  we're now in the era of  Fantastic Voyage   the iPill. You can swallow this completely integrated device. It can take pictures of your GI system  help diagnose and treat as it moves through your GI tract. We get into even smaller micro robots that will eventually autonomously move through your system again and be able to do things that surgeons can't do in a much less invasive manner. Sometimes these might self assemble in your GI system and be augmented in that reality. On the cardiac side  pacemakers are getting smaller and much easier to place so you don't need to train an interventional cardiologist to place them. And they're going to be wirelessly telemetered again to your mobile devices so you can go places and be monitored remotely. These are shrinking even further. Here's one that's in prototyping by Medtronic that's smaller than a penny. Artificial retinas  the ability to put these arrays on the back of the eyeball and allow the blind to see. Again  in early trials  but moving into the future. These are going to be game changing. Or for those of us who are sighted  how about having the assisted living contact lens  BlueTooth  WiFi available    beams back images to your eye. Now if you have trouble maintaining your diet  it might help to have some extra imagery to remind you how many calories are going to be coming at you. How about enabling the pathologist to use their cell phone again to see at a microscopic level and to lumber that data back to the cloud and make better diagnostics  In fact  the whole era of laboratory medicine is completely changing. We can now leverage microfluidics  like this chip made by Steve Quake at Stanford. Microfluidics can replace an entire lab of technicians. Put it on a chip  enable thousands of tests to be done at the point of care  anywhere in the world. And this is really going to leverage technology to the rural and the under served and enable what used to be thousand dollar tests to be done at pennies and at the point of care. If we go down the small pathway a little bit farther  we're entering the era of nanomedicine  the ability to make devices super small to the point where we can design red blood cells or microrobots that will monitor our blood system or immune system  or even those that might clear out the clots from our arteries. Now how about exponentially cheaper  Not something we usually think about in the era of medicine  but hard disks used to be       dollars for    megabytes    exponentially cheaper. In genomics now  the genome cost about a billion dollars about    years ago when the first one came out. We're now approaching essentially a thousand dollar genome    probably next year to two years  probably a hundred dollar genome. What are we going to do with hundred dollar genomes  And soon we'll have millions of these tests available. And that's when it gets interesting  when we start to crowdsource that information. And we enter the era of true personalized medicine    the right drug for the right person at the right time    instead of what we're doing today  which is the same drug for everybody    sort of blockbuster drug medications  medications which don't work for you  the individual. And many  many different companies are working on leveraging these approaches. And I'll also show you a simple example  from   andMe again. My data indicates that I've got about average risk for developing macular degeneration  a kind of blindness. But if I take that same data  upload it to deCODEme  I can look at my risk for sample type   diabetes. I'm at almost twice the risk for type   diabetes. I might want to watch how much dessert I have at the lunch break for example. It might change my behavior. Leveraging my knowledge of my pharmacogenomics    how my genes modulate  what my drugs do and what doses I need are going to become increasingly important  and once in the hands of the individual and the patient  will make better drug dosing and selection available. So again  it's not just genes  it's multiple details    our habits  our environmental exposure. When was the last time your physician asked you where you've lived  Geomedicine  where you've lived  what you've been exposed to  can dramatically affect your health. We can capture that information. So genomics  proteomics  the environment  all this data streaming at us individually and us  as poor physicians  how do we manage it  Well we're now entering the era of systems medicine  or systems biology  where we can start to integrate all of this information. And by looking at the patterns  for example  in our blood of        biomarkers in a single test  we can start to look at these little patterns and detect disease at a much earlier stage. This has been called by Lee Hood  the father of the field  P  medicine. We're going to be predictive  we're going to know what you're likely to have. We can be preventative  that prevention can be personalized  and more importantly  it's going to become increasingly participatory. Through websites like Patients Like Me or managing your data on Microsoft HealthVault or Google Health  leveraging this together in participatory ways is going to become increasingly important. So I'll finish up with exponentially better. We'd like to get therapies better and more effective. Now today we treat high blood pressure mostly with pills. What if we take a new device and knock out the nerve vessels that help mediate blood pressure and in a single therapy to cure hypertension  This is a new device that is essentially doing that. It should be on the market within a year or two. How about more targeted therapies for cancer  Right  I'm an oncologist and I have to say most of what we give is actually poison. We've learned at Stanford and other places that we can discover cancer stem cells  the ones that seem to be really responsible for disease relapse. So if you think of cancer as a weed  we often can whack the weed away. It seems to shrink  but it often comes back. So we're attacking the wrong target. The cancer stem cells remain  and the tumor can return months or years later. We're now learning to identify the cancer stem cells and identify those as targets and go for the long term cure. And we're entering the era of personalized oncology  the ability to leverage all of this data together  analyze the tumor and come up with a real  specific cocktail for the individual patient. Now I'll close with regenerative medicine. So I've studied a lot about stem cells    embryonic stem cells are particularly powerful. We also have adult stem cells throughout our body. We use those in my field of bone marrow transplantation. Geron  just last year  started the first trial using human embryonic stem cells to treat spinal cord injuries. Still a Phase I trial  but evolving. We've been actually using adult stem cells now in clinical trials for about    years to approach a whole range of topics  particularly in cardiovascular disease. We take our own bone marrow cells and treat a patient with a heart attack  we can see much improved heart function and actually better survival using our own bone marrow drive cells after a heart attack. I invented a device called the MarrowMiner  a much less invasive way for harvesting bone marrow. It's now been FDA approved  and it'll hopefully be on the market in the next year or so. Hopefully you can appreciate the device there curving through the patient's body and removing the patient's bone marrow  instead of with     punctures  with just a single puncture under local anesthesia. But where is stem cell therapy really going  If you think about it  every cell in your body has the same DNA as you had when you were an embryo. We can now reprogram your skin cells to actually act like a pluripotent embryonic stem cell and to utilize those potentially to treat multiple organs in that same patient    making your own personalized stem cell lines. And I think they'll be a new era of your own stem cell banking to have in the freezer your own cardiac cells  myocytes and neural cells to use them in the future  should you need them. And we're integrating this now with a whole era of cellular engineering  and integrating exponential technologies for essentially  D organ printing    replacing the ink with cells and essentially building and reconstructing a  D organ. That's where things are going to head    still very early days. But I think  as integration of exponential technologies  this is the example. So in close  as you think about technology trends and how to impact health and medicine  we're entering an era of miniaturization  decentralization and personalization. And I think by pulling these things together  if we can start to think about how to understand and leverage these  we're going to empower the patient  enable the doctor  enhance wellness and begin to cure the well before they get sick. Because I know as a doctor  if someone comes to me with Stage I disease  I'm thrilled    we can often cure them. But often it's too late and it's Stage III or IV cancer  for example. So by leveraging these technologies together  I think we'll enter a new era that I like to call Stage   medicine. And as a cancer doctor  I'm looking forward to being out of a job. Thanks very much. Host  Thank you. Thank you. Take a bow. Take a bow. I'm a contemporary artist with a bit of an unexpected background. I was in my   s before I ever went to an art museum. I grew up in the middle of nowhere on a dirt road in rural Arkansas  an hour from the nearest movie theater. And I think it was a great place to grow up as an artist because I grew up around quirky  colorful characters who were great at making with their hands. And my childhood is more hick than I could ever possibly relate to you  and also more intellectual than you would ever expect. For instance  me and my sister  when we were little  we would compete to see who could eat the most squirrel brains. But on the other side of that  though  we were big readers in our house. And if the TV was on  we were watching a documentary. And my dad is the most voracious reader I know. He can read a novel or two a day. But when I was little  I remember  he would kill flies in our house with my BB gun. And what was so amazing to me about that    well he would be in his recliner  would holler for me to fetch the BB gun  and I'd go get it. And what was amazing to me    well it was pretty kickass  he was killing a fly in the house with a gun    but what was so amazing to me was that he knew just enough how to pump it. And he could shoot it from two rooms away and not damage what it was on because he knew how to pump it just enough to kill the fly and not damage what it landed on. So I should talk about art. Or we'll be here all day with my childhood stories. I love contemporary art  but I'm often really frustrated with the contemporary art world and the contemporary art scene. A few years ago  I spent months in Europe to see the major international art exhibitions that have the pulse of what is supposed to be going on in the art world. And I was struck by going to so many  one after the other  with some clarity of what it was that I was longing for. And I was longing for several things that I wasn't getting  or not getting enough of. But two of the main things  one of it  I was longing for more work that was appealing to a broad public  that was accessible. And the second thing that I was longing for was some more exquisite craftsmanship and technique. So I started thinking and listing what all it was that I thought would make a perfect biennial. So I decided  I'm going to start my own biennial. I'm going to organize it and direct it and get it going in the world. So I thought  okay  I have to have some criteria of how to choose work. So amongst all the criteria I have  there's two main things. One of them  I call my Mimaw's Test. And what that is is I imagine explaining a work of art to my grandmother in five minutes  and if I can't explain it in five minutes  then it's too obtuse or esoteric and it hasn't been refined enough yet. It needs to worked on until it can speak fluently. And then my other second set of rules    I hate to say  rules  because it's art    my criteria would be the three H's  which is head  heart and hands. And great art would have  head   it would have interesting intellectual ideas and concepts. It would have  heart  in that it would have passion and heart and soul. And it would have  hand  in that it would be greatly crafted. So I started thinking about how am I going to do this biennial  how am I going to travel the world and find these artists  And then I realized one day  there's an easier solution to this. I'm just going to make the whole thing myself. And so this is what I did. So I thought  a biennial needs artists. I'm going to do an international biennial  I need artists from all around the world. So what I did was I invented a hundred artists from around the world. I figured out their bios  their passions in life and their art styles  and I started making their work. I felt  oh this is the kind of project that I could spend my whole life doing. So I decided  I'm going to make this a real biennial. It's going to be two years of studio work. And I'm going to create this in two years  and I have. So I should start to talk about these guys. Well the range is quite a bit. And I'm such a technician  so I loved this project  getting to play with all the techniques. So for example  in realist paintings  it ranges from this  which is kind of old masters style  to really realistic still life  to this type of painting where I'm painting with a single hair. And then at the other end  there's performance and short films and indoor installations like this indoor installation and this one  and outdoor installations like this one and this one. I know I should mention  I'm making all these things. This isn't Photoshopped. I'm under the river with those fish. So now let me introduce some of my fictional artists to you. This is Nell Remmel. Nell is interested in agricultural processes  and her work is based in these practices. This piece  which is called  Flipped Earth     she was interested in taking the sky and using it to cleanse barren ground. And by taking giant mirrors    and here she's taking giant mirrors and pulling them into the dirt. And this is    feet long. And what I loved about her work is  when I would walk around it and look down into the sky  looking down to watch the sky  and it unfolded in a new way. And probably the best part of this piece is at dusk and dawn when the twilight wedge has fallen and the ground's dark  but there's still the light above  bright above. And so you're standing there and everything else is dark  but there's this portal that you want to jump in. This piece was great. This is in my parents' backyard in Arkansas. And I love to dig a hole. So this piece was great fun because it was two days of digging in soft dirt. The next artist is Kay Overstry  and she's interested in ephemerality and transience. And in her most recent project  it's called  Weather I Made.  And she's making weather on her body's scale. And this piece is  Frost.  And what she did was she went out on a cold  dry night and breathed back and forth on the lawn to leave    to leave her life's mark  the mark of her life. And so this is five foot  five inches of frost that she left behind. The sun rises  and it melts away. And that was played by my mom. So the next artist  this is a group of Japanese artists  a collective of Japanese artists    in Tokyo. And they were interested in developing a new  alternative art space  and they needed funding for it  so they decided to come up with some interesting fundraising projects. One of these is scratch off masterpieces. And so what they're doing    each of these artists on a nine by seven inch card  which they sell for    bucks  they drew original works of art. And you buy one  and maybe you get a real piece  and maybe not. Well this has sparked a craze in Japan  because everyone's wanting a masterpiece. And the ones that are the most sought after are the ones that are only barely scratched off. And all these works  in some way  talk about luck or fate or chance. Those first two are portraits of mega jackpot winners years before and after their win. And in this one it's called  Drawing the Short Stick.  I love this piece because I have a little cousin at home who introduced me    which I think is such a great introduction    to a friend one day as   This is my cousin Shea. He draws sticks real good.  Which is one of the best compliments ever. This artist is Gus Weinmueller  and he's doing a project  a large project  called  Art for the Peoples.  And within this project  he's doing a smaller project called  Artists in Residence.  And what he does is    he spends a week at a time with a family. And he shows up on their porch  their doorstep  with a toothbrush and pajamas  and he's ready to spend the week with them. And using only what's present  he goes in and makes a little abode studio to work out of. And he spends that week talking to the family about what do they think great art is. He has all these discussions with their family  and he digs through everything they have  and he finds materials to make work. And he makes a work that answers what they think great art is. For this family  he made this still life painting. And whatever he makes somehow references nesting and space and personal property. This next project  this is by Jaochim Parisvega  and he's interested in    he believes art is everywhere waiting    that it just needs a little bit of a push to happen. And he provides this push by harnessing natural forces  like in his series where he used rain to make paintings. This project is called  Love Nests.  What he did was to get wild birds to make his art for him. So he put the material in places where the birds were going to collect them  and they crafted his nests for him. And this one's called  Lovelock's Nest.  This one's called  Mixtape Love Song's Nest.  And this one's called  Lovemaking Nest.  Next is Sylvia Slater. Sylvia's interested in art training. She's a very serious Swiss artist. And she was thinking about her friends and family who work in chaos ridden places and developing countries  and she was thinking  what can I make that would be of value to them  in case something bad happens and they have to buy their way across the border or pay off a gunman  And so she came up with creating these pocket sized artworks that are portraits of the person that would carry them. And you would carry this around with you  and if everything went to hell  you could make payments and buy your life. So this life price is for an irrigation non profit director. So hopefully what happens is you never use it  and it's an heirloom that you pass down. And she makes them so they could either be broken up into payments  or they could be like these  which are leaves that can be payments. And so they're valuable. This is precious metals and gemstones. And this one had to get broken up. He had to break off a piece to get out of Egypt recently. This is by a duo  Michael Abernathy and Bud Holland. And they're interested in creating culture  just tradition. So what they do is they move into an area and try to establish a new tradition in a small geographic area. So this is in Eastern Tennessee  and what they decided was that we need a positive tradition that goes with death. So they came up with  dig jigs.  And a dig jig    a dig jig is where  for a milestone anniversary or a birthday  you gather all your friends and family together and you dance on where you're going to be buried. And we got a lot of attention when we did it. I talked my family into doing this  and they didn't know what I was doing. And I was like   Get dressed for a funeral. We're going to go do some work.  And so we got to the grave and made this  which was hilarious    the attention that we got. So what happens is you dance on the grave  and after you've done your dance  everyone toasts you and tells you how great you are. And you in essence have a funeral that you get to be present for. That's my mom and dad. This is by Jason Birdsong. He is interested in how we see as an animal  how we are interested in mimicry and camouflage. You know  we look down a dark alley or a jungle path  trying to make out a face or a creature. We just have that natural way of seeing. And he plays with this idea. And this piece  those aren't actually leaves. They're butterfly specimens who have a natural camouflage. So he pairs these up. There's another pile of leaves. Those are actually all real butterfly specimens. And he pairs these up with paintings. Like this is a painting of a snake in a box. So you open the box and you think   Whoa  there's a snake in there.  But it's actually a painting. So he makes these interesting conversations about realism and mimicry and our drive to be fooled by great camouflage. The next artist is Hazel Clausen. Hazel Clausen is an anthropologist who took a sabbatical and decided   You know  I would learn a lot about culture if I created a culture that doesn't exist from scratch.  So that's what she did. She created the Swiss people named the Uvulites  and they have this distinctive yodeling song that they use the uvula for. And also they reference how the uvula    everything they say is fallen because of the forbidden fruit. And that's the symbol of their culture. And this is from a documentary called  Sexual Practices and Populations Control Among the Uvulites.  This is a typical angora embroidery for them. This is one of their founders  Gert Schaeffer. And actually this is my Aunt Irene. It was so funny having a fake person who was making fake things. And I crack up at this piece  because when I see it I know that's French angora and all antique German ribbons and wool that I got in a Nebraska mill and carried around for    years and then antique Chinese skirts. The next is a collective of artists called the Silver Dobermans  and their motto is to spread pragmatism one person at a time. And they're really interested in how over coddled we've become. So this is one of their comments on how over coddled we've become. And what they've done is they put a warning sign on every single barb on this fence. And this is called  Horse Sense Fence.  The next artist is K. M. Yoon  a really interesting South Korean artist. And he's reworking a Confucian art tradition of scholar stones. Next is Maynard Sipes. And I love Maynard Sipes  but he's off in his own world  and  bless his heart  he's so paranoid. Next is Roy Penig  a really interesting Kentucky artist  and he's the nicest guy. He even once traded a work of art for a block of government cheese because the person wanted it so badly. Next is an Australian artist  Janeen Jackson  and this is from a project of hers called  What an Artwork Does When We're Not Watching.  Next is by a Lithuanian fortune teller  Jurgi Petrauskas. Next is Ginger Cheshire. This is from a short film of hers called  The Last Person.  And that's my cousin and my sister's dog  Gabby. The next  this is by Sam Sandy. He's an Australian Aboriginal elder  and he's also an artist. And this is from a large traveling sculpture project that he's doing. This is from Estelle Willoughsby. She heals with color. And she's one of the most prolific of all these hundred artists  even though she's going to be    next year. This is by Z. Zhou  and he's interested in stasis. Next is by Hilda Singh  and she's doing a whole project called  Social Outfits.  Next is by Vera Sokolova. And I have to say  Vera kind of scares me. You can't look her directly in the eyes because she's kind of scary. And it's good that she's not real  she'd be mad that I said that. And she's an optometrist in St. Petersburg  and she plays with optics. Next  this is by Thomas Swifton. This is from a short film   Adventures with Skinny.  And this is by Cicily Bennett  and it's from a series of short films. And after this one  there's    other artists. And all together with those other    you're not seeing  that's my biennial. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. Thanks. I'm here today to start a revolution. Now before you get up in arms  or you break into song  or you pick a favorite color  I want to define what I mean by revolution. By revolution  I mean a drastic and far reaching change in the way we think and behave    the way we think and the way we behave. Now why  Steve  why do we need a revolution  We need a revolution because things aren't working  they're just not working. And that makes me really sad because I'm sick and tired of things not working. You know  I'm sick and tired of us not living up to our potential. I'm sick and tired of us being last. And we are last place in so many things    for example  social factors. We're last place in Europe in innovation. There we are right at the end  right at the bottom  last place as a culture that doesn't value innovation. We're last place in health care  and that's important for a sense of well being. And there we are  not just last in the E.U.  we're last in Europe  at the very bottom. And worst of all  it just came out three weeks ago  many of you have seen it  The Economist. We're the saddest place on Earth  relative to GDP per capita    the saddest place on Earth. That's social. Let's look at education. Where do we rank three weeks ago in another report by the OECD  Last in reading  math and science. Last. Business  The lowest perception in the E.U. that entrepreneurs provide benefits to society. Why as a result  what happens  The lowest percentage of entrepreneurs starting businesses. And this is despite the fact that everybody knows that small business is the engine of economies. We hire the most people  we create the most taxes. So if our engine's broken  guess what  Last in Europe GDP per capita. Last. So it's no surprise  guys  that    percent of Bulgarians are not optimistic about the future. We're unhappy  we have bad education  and we have the worst businesses. And these are facts  guys. This isn't story tale  it's not make believe. It's not. It's not a conspiracy I have got against Bulgaria. These are facts. So I think it should be really  really clear that our system is broken. The way we think  the way we behave  our operating system of behaving is broken. We need a drastic change in the way we think and behave to transform Bulgaria for the better  for ourselves  for our friends  for our family and for our future. How did this happen  Let's be positive now. We're going to get positive. How did this happen  I think we're last because    and this is going to be drastic to some of you    because we are handicapping ourselves. We're holding ourselves back because we don't value play. I said  play   all right. In case some of you forgot what play is  this is what play looks like. Babies play  kids play  adults play. We don't value play. In fact  we devalue play. And we devalue it in three areas. Let's go back to the same three areas. Social     years of what  Of communism    of valuing the society and the state over the individual and squashing  inadvertently  creativity  individual self expression and innovation. And instead  what do we value  Because it's shown the way we apply  generate and use knowledge is affected by our social and institutional context  which told us what in communism  To be serious. To be really  really serious. It did. Be serious. I can't tell you how many times I've been scolded in the park for letting my kids play on the ground. Heaven forbid they play in the dirt  the kal  or even worse  lokvi  water    that will kill them. I have been told by babas and dyados that we shouldn't let our kids play so much because life is serious and we need to train them for the seriousness of life. We have a serious meme running through. It's a social gene running through us. It's a serious gene. It's    years of it that's created what I call the  baba factor.  And here's how it works. Step one  woman says   I want to have a baby. Iskam baby.  Step two  we get the baby. Woohoo  But then what happens in step three  I want to go back to work because I need to further my career or I just want to go have coffees. I'm going to give bebko to baba. But we need to remember that baba's been infected by the serious meme for    years. So what happens  She passes that virus on to baby  and it takes a really  really  really long time    as the redwood trees    for that serious meme to get out of our operating system. What happens then  It goes into education where we have an antiquated education system that has little changed for     years  that values rote learning  memorization and standardization  and devalues self expression  self exploration  questioning  creativity and play. It's a crap system. True story  I went looking for a school for my kid. We went to this prestigious little school and they say they're going to study math    times a week and science eight times a week and reading five times a day and all this stuff. And we said   Well what about play and recess   And they said   Ha. There won't be a single moment in the schedule.  And we said   He's five.  What a crime. What a crime. And it's a crime that our education system is so serious because education is serious that we're creating mindless  robotic workers to put bolts in pre drilled holes. But I'm sorry  the problems of today are not the problems of the Industrial Revolution. We need adaptability  the ability to learn how to be creative and innovative. We don't need mechanized workers. But no  now our meme goes into work where we don't value play. We create robotic workers that we treat like assets  to lever and just throw away. What are qualities of a Bulgarian work  Autocratic    do what I say because I'm the chef. I'm the boss and I know better than you. Untrusting    you're obviously a criminal  so I'm going to install cameras. Controlling    you're obviously an idiot  so I'm going to make a zillion little processes for you to follow so you don't step out of the box. So they're restrictive    don't use your mobile phone  don't use your laptop  don't search the Internet  don't be on I.M. That's somehow unprofessional and bad. And at the end of the day  it's unfulfilling because you're controlled  you're restricted  you're not valued and you're not having any fun. In social  in education and in our business  don't value play. And that's why we're last  because we don't value play. And you can say   That's ridiculous  Steve. What a dumb idea. It can't be because of play. Just play  that's a stupid thing.  We have the serious meme in us. Well I'm going to say no. And I will prove it to you in the next part of the speech    that play is the catalyst  it is the revolution  that we can use to transform Bulgaria for the better. Play  our brains are hardwired for play. Evolution has selected  over millions and billions of years  for play in animals and in humans. And you know what  Evolution does a really  really good job of deselecting traits that aren't advantageous to us and selecting traits for competitive advantage. Nature isn't stupid  and it selected for play. Throughout the animal kingdom  for example  ants. Ants play. Maybe you didn't know that. But when they're playing  they're learning the social order and dynamics of things. Rats play  but what you might not have known is that rats that play more have bigger brains and they learn tasks better  skills. Kittens play. We all know kittens play. But what you may not know is that kittens deprived of play are unable to interact socially. They can still hunt  but they can't be social. Bears play. But what you may not know is that bears that play more survive longer. It's not the bears that learn how to fish better. It's the ones that play more. And a final really interesting study    it's been shown  a correlation between play and brain size. The more you play  the bigger the brains there are. Dolphins  pretty big brains  play a lot. But who do you think with the biggest brains are the biggest players  Yours truly  humans. Kids play  we play    of every nationality  of every race  of every color  of every religion. It's a universal thing    we play. And it's not just kids  it's adults too. Really cool term  neoteny    the retention of play and juvenile traits in adults. And who are the biggest neotenists  Humans. We play sports. We do it for fun  or as Olympians  or as professionals. We play musical instruments. We dance  we kiss  we sing  we just goof around. We're designed by nature to play from birth to old age. We're designed to do that continuously    to play and play a lot and not stop playing. It is a huge benefit. Just like there's benefits to animals  there's benefits to humans. For example  it's been shown to stimulate neural growth in the amygdala  in the area where it controls emotions. It's been shown to promote pre frontal cortex development where a lot of cognition is happening. As a result  what happens  We develop more emotional maturity if we play more. We develop better decision making ability if we play more. These guys are facts. It's not fiction  it's not story tales  it's not make believe  it's cold  hard science. These are the benefits to play. It is a genetic birthright that we have  like walking or speaking or seeing. And if we handicap ourselves with play  we handicap ourselves as if we would with any other birthright that we have. We hold ourselves back. Little exercise just for a second  close your eyes and try to imagine a world without play. Imagine a world without theater  without the arts  without song  without dancing  without soccer  without football  without laughter. What does this world look like  It's pretty bleak. It's pretty glum. Now imagine your workplace. Is it fun  Is it playful  Or maybe the workplace of your friends    here we're forward thinking. Is it fun  Is it playful  Or is it crap  Is it autocratic  controlling  restrictive and untrusting and unfulfilling  We have this concept that the opposite of play is work. We even feel guilty if we're seen playing at work.  Oh  my colleagues see me laughing. I must not have enough work   or   Oh  I've got to hide because my boss might see me. He's going to think I'm not working hard.  But I have news for you  our thinking is backwards. The opposite of play is not work. The opposite of play is depression. It's depression. In fact  play improves our work. Just like there's benefits for humans and animals  there's benefits for play at work. For example  it stimulates creativity. It increases our openness to change. It improves our ability to learn. It provides a sense of purpose and mastery    two key motivational things that increase productivity  through play. So before you start thinking of play as just not serious  play doesn't mean frivolous. You know  the professional athlete that loves skiing  he's serious about it  but he loves it. He's having fun  he's in the groove  he's in the flow. A doctor might be serious  but laughter's still a great medicine. Our thinking is backwards. We shouldn't be feeling guilty. We should be celebrating play. Quick example from the corporate world. FedEx  easy motto  people  service  profit. If you treat your people like people  if you treat them great  they're happier  they're fulfilled  they have a sense of mastery and purpose. What happens  They give better service    not worse  but better. And when customers call for service and they're dealing with happy people that can make decisions and are fulfilled  how do the customers feel  They feel great. And what do great customers do  great feeling customers  They buy more of your service and they tell more of their friends  which leads to more profit. People  service  profit. Play increases productivity  not decreases. And you're going to say   Gee  that can work for FedEx out there in the United States  but it can't work in Bulgaria. No way. We're different.  It does work in Bulgaria  you guys. Two reasons. One  play is universal. There's nothing weird about Bulgarians that we can't play  besides the serious meme that we have to kick out. Two  I've tried it. I've tried at Sciant. When I got there  we had zero happy customers. Not one customer would refer us. I asked them all. We had marginal profit    I did. We had marginal profits  and we had unhappy stakeholders. Through some basic change  change like improving transparency  change like promoting self direction and collaboration  encouraging collaboration  not autocracy  the things like having a results focus. I don't care when you get in in the morning. I don't care when you leave. I care that your customer and your team is happy and you're organized with that. Why do I care if you get in at nine o'clock  Basically promoting fun. Through promoting fun and a great environment  we were able to transform Sciant and  in just three short years    sounds like a long time  but change is slow    every customer  from zero to every customer referring us  above average profits for the industry and happy stakeholders. And you can say   Well how do you know they're happy   Well we did win  every year that we entered  one of the rankings for best employer for small business. Independent analysis from anonymous employees on their surveys. It does  and it can  work in Bulgaria. There's nothing holding us back  except our own mentality about play. So some steps that we can take    to finish up    how to make this revolution through play. First of all  you have to believe me. If you don't believe me  well just go home and think about it some more or something. Second of all  if you don't have the feeling of play in you  you need to rediscover play. Whatever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy  that you enjoyed only six months ago  but now that you've got that promotion you can't enjoy  because you feel like you have to be serious  rediscover it. I don't care if it's mountain biking or reading a book or playing a game. Rediscover that because you're the leaders  the innovation leaders  the thought leaders. You're the ones that have to go back to the office or talk to your friends and ignite the fire of change in the play revolution. You guys have to  and if you're not feeling it  your colleagues  your employees  aren't going to feel it. You've got to go back and say   Hey  I'm going to trust you.  Weird concept  I hired you  I should trust you. I'm going to let you make decisions. I'm going to empower you  and I'm going to delegate to the lowest level  rather than the top. I'm going to encourage constructive criticism. I'm going to let you challenge authority. Because it's by challenging the way things are always done is that we are able to break out of the rut that we're in and create innovative solutions to problems of today. We're not always right as leaders. We're going to eradicate fear. Fear is the enemy of play. And we're going to do things like eliminate restrictions. You know what  let them use their mobile phone for personal calls    heaven forbid. Let them be on the Internet. Let them be on instant messengers. Let them take long lunches. Lunch is like the recess for work. It's when you go out in the world and you recharge your brain  you meet your friends  you have a beer  you have some food  you talk  you get some synergy of ideas that maybe you wouldn't have had before. Let them do it. Give them some freedom  and in general  let them play. Let them have fun at the workplace. We spend so much of our lives at the workplace  and it's supposed to be  what  a miserable grind  so that    years from now  we wake up and say   Is this it  Is that all there was   Unacceptable. Nepriemliv. So in summary  we need a drastic change in the way we think and behave  but we don't need a workers' revolution. We don't need a workers' revolution. What we need is a players' uprising. What we need is a players' uprising. What we need is a players' uprising. Seriously  we need to band together. Today is the start of the uprising. But what you need to do is fan the flames of the revolution. You need to go and share your ideas and your success stories of what worked about reinvigorating our lives  our schools  and our work with play  about how play promotes a sense of promise and self fulfillment  of how play promotes innovation and productivity  and  ultimately  how play creates meaning. Because we can't do it alone. We have to do it together  and together  if we do this and share these ideas on play  we can transform Bulgaria for the better. Thank you. As an artist  connection is very important to me. Through my work I'm trying to articulate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected. I first went to Antarctica almost    years ago  where I saw my first icebergs. I was in awe. My heart beat fast  my head was dizzy  trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me. The icebergs around me were almost     feet out of the water  and I could only help but wonder that this was one snowflake on top of another snowflake  year after year. Icebergs are born when they calve off of glaciers or break off of ice shelves. Each iceberg has its own individual personality. They have a distinct way of interacting with their environment and their experiences. Some refuse to give up and hold on to the bitter end  while others can't take it anymore and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion. It's easy to think  when you look at an iceberg  that they're isolated  that they're separate and alone  much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves. But the reality is far from it. As an iceberg melts  I am breathing in its ancient atmosphere. As the iceberg melts  it is releasing mineral rich fresh water that nourishes many forms of life. I approach photographing these icebergs as if I'm making portraits of my ancestors  knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again. It is not a death when they melt  it is not an end  but a continuation of their path through the cycle of life. Some of the ice in the icebergs that I photograph is very young    a couple thousand years old. And some of the ice is over         years old. The last pictures I'd like to show you are of an iceberg that I photographed in Qeqetarsuaq  Greenland. It's a very rare occasion that you get to actually witness an iceberg rolling. So here it is. You can see on the left side a small boat. That's about a    foot boat. And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it is at the waterline. You can see here  it begins to roll  and the boat has moved to the other side  and the man is standing there. This is an average size Greenlandic iceberg. It's about     feet above the water  or    meters. And this video is real time. And just like that  the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality. Thank you. By birth and by choice  I've been involved with the auto industry my entire life  and for the past    years  I've worked at Ford Motor Company. And for most of those years  I worried about  how am I going to sell more cars and trucks  But today I worry about  what if all we do is sell more cars and trucks  What happens when the number of vehicles on the road doubles  triples  or even quadruples  My life is guided by two great passions  and the first is automobiles. I literally grew up with the Ford Motor Company. I thought it was so cool as a little boy when my dad would bring home the latest Ford or Lincoln and leave it in the driveway. And I decided about that time  about age     that it would be really cool if I was a test driver. So my parents would go to dinner. They'd sit down  I'd sneak out of the house. I'd jump behind the wheel and take the new model around the driveway  and it was a blast. And that went on for about two years  until    I think I was about       my dad brought home a Lincoln Mark III. And it was snowing that day. So he and mom went to dinner  and I snuck out and thought it'd be really cool to do donuts or even some figure eights in the snow. My dad finished dinner early that evening. And he was walking to the front hall and out the front door just about the same time I hit some ice and met him at the front door with the car    and almost ended up in the front hall. So it kind of cooled my test driving for a little while. But I really began to love cars then. And my first car was a      electric green Mustang. And even though the color was pretty hideous  I did love the car  and it really cemented my love affair with cars that's continued on to this day. But cars are really more than a passion of mine  they're quite literally in my blood. My great grandfather was Henry Ford  and on my mother's side  my great grandfather was Harvey Firestone. So when I was born  I guess you could say expectations were kind of high for me. But my great grandfather  Henry Ford  really believed that the mission of the Ford Motor Company was to make people's lives better and make cars affordable so that everyone could have them. Because he believed that with mobility comes freedom and progress. And that's a belief that I share. My other great passion is the environment. And as a young boy  I used to go up to Northern Michigan and fish in the rivers that Hemingway fished in and then later wrote about. And it really struck me as the years went by  in a very negative way  when I would go to some stream that I'd loved  and was used to walking through this field that was once filled with fireflies  and now had a strip mall or a bunch of condos on it. And so even at a young age  that really resonated with me  and the whole notion of environmental preservation  at a very basic level  sunk in with me. As a high schooler  I started to read authors like Thoreau and Aldo Leopold and Edward Abbey  and I really began to develop a deeper appreciation of the natural world. But it never really occurred to me that my love of cars and trucks would ever be in conflict with nature. And that was true until I got to college. And when I got to college  you can imagine my surprise when I would go to class and a number of my professors would say that Ford Motor Company and my family was everything that was wrong with our country. They thought that we were more interested  as an industry  in profits  rather than progress  and that we filled the skies with smog    and frankly  we were the enemy. I joined Ford after college  after some soul searching whether or not this is really the right thing to do. But I decided that I wanted to go and see if I could affect change there. And as I look back over    years ago  it was a little naive to think at that age that I could. But I wanted to. And I really discovered that my professors weren't completely wrong. In fact  when I got back to Detroit  my environmental leanings weren't exactly embraced by those in my own company  and certainly by those in the industry. I had some very interesting conversations  as you can imagine. There were some within Ford who believed that all this ecological nonsense should just disappear and that I needed to stop hanging out with  environmental wackos.  I was considered a radical. And I'll never forget the day I was called in by a member of top management and told to stop associating with any known or suspected environmentalists. Of course  I had no intention of doing that  and I kept speaking out about the environment  and it really was the topic that we now today call sustainability. And in time  my views went from controversial to more or less consensus today. I mean  I think most people in the industry understand that we've got to get on with it. And the good news is today we are tackling the big issues  of cars and the environment    not only at Ford  but really as an industry. We're pushing fuel efficiency to new heights. And with new technology  we're reducing    and I believe  someday we'll eliminate    CO  emissions. We're starting to sell electric cars  which is great. We're developing alternative powertrains that are going to make cars affordable in every sense of the word    economically  socially and environmentally. And actually  although we've got a long way to go and a lot of work to do  I can see the day where my two great passions    cars and the environment    actually come into harmony. But unfortunately  as we're on our way to solving one monstrous problem    and as I said  we're not there yet  we've got a lot of work to do  but I can see where we will    but even as we're in the process of doing that  another huge problem is looming  and people aren't noticing. And that is the freedom of mobility that my great grandfather brought to people is now being threatened  just as the environment is. The problem  put in its simplest terms  is one of mathematics. Today there are approximately  .  billion people in the world  and within our lifetime  that number's going to grow to about nine billion. And at that population level  our planet will be dealing with the limits of growth. And with that growth comes some severe practical problems  one of which is our transportation system simply won't be able to deal with it. When we look at the population growth in terms of cars  it becomes even clearer. Today there are about     million cars on the road worldwide. But with more people and greater prosperity around the world  that number's going to grow to between two and four billion cars by mid century. And this is going to create the kind of global gridlock that the world has never seen before. Now think about the impact that this is going to have on our daily lives. Today the average American spends about a week a year stuck in traffic jams  and that's a huge waste of time and resources. But that's nothing compared to what's going on in the nations that are growing the fastest. Today the average driver in Beijing has a five hour commute. And last summer    many of you probably saw this    there was a hundred mile traffic jam that took    days to clear in China. In the decades to come     percent of the world's population will live in cities  and    of those cities will be of    million people or more. So you can see the size of the issue that we're facing. When you factor in population growth  it's clear that the mobility model that we have today simply will not work tomorrow. Frankly  four billion clean cars on the road are still four billion cars  and a traffic jam with no emissions is still a traffic jam. So  if we make no changes today  what does tomorrow look like  Well I think you probably already have the picture. Traffic jams are just a symptom of this challenge  and they're really very  very inconvenient  but that's all they are. But the bigger issue is that global gridlock is going to stifle economic growth and our ability to deliver food and health care  particularly to people that live in city centers. And our quality of life is going to be severely compromised. So what's going to solve this  Well the answer isn't going to be more of the same. My great grandfather once said before he invented the Model T   If I had asked people then what they wanted  they would have answered  'We want faster horses.'  So the answer to more cars is simply not to have more roads. When America began moving west  we didn't add more wagon trains  we built railroads. And to connect our country after World War II  we didn't build more two lane highways  we built the interstate highway system. Today we need that same leap in thinking for us to create a viable future. We are going to build smart cars  but we also need to build smart roads  smart parking  smart public transportation systems and more. We don't want to waste our time sitting in traffic  sitting at tollbooths or looking for parking spots. We need an integrated system that uses real time data to optimize personal mobility on a massive scale without hassle or compromises for travelers. And frankly  that's the kind of system that's going to make the future of personal mobility sustainable. Now the good news is some of this work has already begun in different parts of the world. The city of Masdar in Abu Dhabi uses driverless electric vehicles that can communicate with one another  and they go underneath the city streets. And up above  you've got a series of pedestrian walkways. On New York City's   th Street  gridlock will soon be replaced with a connected system of vehicle specific corridors. Pedestrian zones and dedicated traffic lanes are going to be created  and all of this will cut down the average rush hour commute to get across town in New York from about an hour today at rush hour to about    minutes. Now if you look at Hong Kong  they have a very interesting system called Octopus there. It's a system that really ties together all the transportation assets into a single payment system. So parking garages  buses  trains  they all operate within the same system. Now shared car services are also springing up around the world  and these efforts  I think  are great. They're relieving congestion  and they're frankly starting to save some fuel. These are all really good ideas that will move us forward. But what really inspires me is what's going to be possible when our cars can begin talking to each other. Very soon  the same systems that we use today to bring music and entertainment and GPS information into our vehicles are going to be used to create a smart vehicle network. Every morning I drive about    miles from my home in Ann Arbor to my office in Dearborn  Michigan. And every night I go home  my commute is a total crapshoot. And I often have to leave the freeway and look for different ways for me to try and make it home. But very soon we're going to see the days when cars are essentially talking to each other. So if the car ahead of me on I    hits traffic  it will immediately alert my car and tell my car to reroute itself to get me home in the best possible way. And these systems are being tested right now  and frankly they're going to be ready for prime time pretty soon. But the potential of a connected car network is almost limitless. So just imagine  one day very soon  you're going to be able to plan a trip downtown and your car will be connected to a smart parking system. So you get in your car  and as you get in your car  your car will reserve you a parking spot before you arrive    no more driving around looking for one  which frankly is one of the biggest users of fuel in today's cars in urban areas    is looking for parking spots. Or think about being in New York City and tracking down an intelligent cab on your smart phone so you don't have to wait in the cold to hail one. Or being at a future TED Conference and having your car talk to the calendars of everybody here and telling you all the best route to take home and when you should leave so that you can all arrive at your next destination on time. This is the kind of technology that will merge millions of individual vehicles into a single system. So I think it's clear we have the beginnings of a solution to this enormous problem. But as we found out with addressing CO  issues  and also fossil fuels  there is no one silver bullet. The solution is not going to be more cars  more roads or a new rail system  it can only be found  I believe  in a global network of interconnected solutions. Now I know we can develop the technology that's going to make this work  but we've got to be willing to get out there and seek out the solutions    whether that means vehicle sharing or public transportation or some other way we haven't even thought of yet  our overall transportation mix and infrastructure must support all the future options. We need our best and our brightest to start entertaining this issue. Companies  entrepreneurs  venture capitalists  they all need to understand this is a huge business opportunity  as well as an enormous social problem. And just as these groups embrace the green energy challenge    and it's really been amazing to me to watch how much brain power  how much money and how much serious thought has  really over the last three years  just poured into the green energy field. We need that same kind of passion and energy to attack global gridlock. But we need people like all of you in this room  leading thinkers. I mean  frankly  I need all of you to think about how you can help solve this huge issue. And we need people from all walks of life  not just inventors  we need policymakers and government officials to also think about how they're going to respond to this challenge. This isn't going to be solved by any one person or one group. It's going to really require a national energy policy  frankly for each country  because the solutions in each country are going to be different based upon income levels  traffic jams and also how integrated the systems already are. But we need to get going  and we need to get going today. And we must have an infrastructure that's designed to support this flexible future. You know  we've come a long way. Since the Model T  most people never traveled more than    miles from home in their entire lifetime. And since then  the automobile has allowed us the freedom to choose where we live  where we work  where we play and frankly when we just go out and want to move around. We don't want to regress and lose that freedom. We're on our way to solving    and as I said earlier  I know we've got a long way to go    the one big issue that we're all focused on that threatens it  and that's the environmental issue  but I believe we all must turn all of our effort and all of our ingenuity and determination to help now solve this notion of global gridlock. Because in doing so  we're going to preserve what we've really come to take for granted  which is the freedom to move and move very effortlessly around the world. And it frankly will enhance our quality of life if we fix this. Because  if you can envision  as I do  a future of zero emissions and freedom to move around the country and around the world like we take for granted today  that's worth the hard work today to preserve that for tomorrow. I believe we're at our best when we're confronted with big issues. This is a big one  and it won't wait. So let's get started now. Thank you. I'm a savant  or more precisely  a high functioning autistic savant. It's a rare condition. And rarer still when accompanied  as in my case  by self awareness and a mastery of language. Very often when I meet someone and they learn this about me  there's a certain kind of awkwardness. I can see it in their eyes. They want to ask me something. And in the end  quite often  the urge is stronger than they are and they blurt it out   If I give you my date of birth  can you tell me what day of the week I was born on   Or they mention cube roots or ask me to recite a long number or long text. I hope you'll forgive me if I don't perform a kind of one man savant show for you today. I'm going to talk instead about something far more interesting than dates of birth or cube roots    a little deeper and a lot closer  to my mind  than work. I want to talk to you briefly about perception. When he was writing the plays and the short stories that would make his name  Anton Chekhov kept a notebook in which he noted down his observations of the world around him    little details that other people seem to miss. Every time I read Chekhov and his unique vision of human life  I'm reminded of why I too became a writer. In my books  I explore the nature of perception and how different kinds of perceiving create different kinds of knowing and understanding. Here are three questions drawn from my work. Rather than try to figure them out  I'm going to ask you to consider for a moment the intuitions and the gut instincts that are going through your head and your heart as you look at them. For example  the calculation  can you feel where on the number line the solution is likely to fall  Or look at the foreign word and the sounds  can you get a sense of the range of meanings that it's pointing you towards  And in terms of the line of poetry  why does the poet use the word hare rather than rabbit  I'm asking you to do this because I believe our personal perceptions  you see  are at the heart of how we acquire knowledge. Aesthetic judgments  rather than abstract reasoning  guide and shape the process by which we all come to know what we know. I'm an extreme example of this. My worlds of words and numbers blur with color  emotion and personality. As Juan said  it's the condition that scientists call synesthesia  an unusual cross talk between the senses. Here are the numbers one to    as I see them    every number with its own shape and character. One is a flash of white light. Six is a tiny and very sad black hole. The sketches are in black and white here  but in my mind they have colors. Three is green. Four is blue. Five is yellow. I paint as well. And here is one of my paintings. It's a multiplication of two prime numbers. Three dimensional shapes and the space they create in the middle creates a new shape  the answer to the sum. What about bigger numbers  Well you can't get much bigger than Pi  the mathematical constant. It's an infinite number    literally goes on forever. In this painting that I made of the first    decimals of Pi  I take the colors and the emotions and the textures and I pull them all together into a kind of rolling numerical landscape. But it's not only numbers that I see in colors. Words too  for me  have colors and emotions and textures. And this is an opening phrase from the novel  Lolita.  And Nabokov was himself synesthetic. And you can see here how my perception of the sound L helps the alliteration to jump right out. Another example  a little bit more mathematical. And I wonder if some of you will notice the construction of the sentence from  The Great Gatsby.  There is a procession of syllables    wheat  one  prairies  two  lost Swede towns  three    one  two  three. And this effect is very pleasant on the mind  and it helps the sentence to feel right. Let's go back to the questions I posed you a moment ago.    multiplied by   . If some of you play chess  you'll know that    is a square number  and that's why chessboards  eight by eight  have    squares. So that gives us a form that we can picture  that we can perceive. What about     Well if      if we think of     as being like a square     would look like this. So what we need to do now is put those two pictures together in our mind    something like this.    becomes      . And in the right hand corner  you don't have to calculate anything. Four across  four up and down    it's   . So what the sum is actually asking you to do is           . That's a lot easier than the way that the school taught you to do math  I'm sure. It's                                 the answer to the sum. Easy when you know how. The second question was an Icelandic word. I'm assuming there are not many people here who speak Icelandic. So let me narrow the choices down to two. Hnugginn  is it a happy word  or a sad word  What do you say  Okay. Some people say it's happy. Most people  a majority of people  say sad. And it actually means sad. Why do  statistically  a majority of people say that a word is sad  in this case  heavy in other cases  In my theory  language evolves in such a way that sounds match  correspond with  the subjective  with the personal  intuitive experience of the listener. Let's have a look at the third question. It's a line from a poem by John Keats. Words  like numbers  express fundamental relationships between objects and events and forces that constitute our world. It stands to reason that we  existing in this world  should in the course of our lives absorb intuitively those relationships. And poets  like other artists  play with those intuitive understandings. In the case of hare  it's an ambiguous sound in English. It can also mean the fibers that grow from a head. And if we think of that    let me put the picture up    the fibers represent vulnerability. They yield to the slightest movement or motion or emotion. So what you have is an atmosphere of vulnerability and tension. The hare itself  the animal    not a cat  not a dog  a hare    why a hare  Because think of the picture    not the word  the picture. The overlong ears  the overlarge feet  helps us to picture  to feel intuitively  what it means to limp and to tremble. So in these few minutes  I hope I've been able to share a little bit of my vision of things and to show you that words can have colors and emotions  numbers  shapes and personalities. The world is richer  vaster than it too often seems to be. I hope that I've given you the desire to learn to see the world with new eyes. Thank you. You know  what I do is write for children  and I'm probably America's most widely read children's author  in fact. And I always tell people that I don't want to show up looking like a scientist. You can have me as a farmer  or in leathers  and no one has ever chose farmer. I'm here today to talk to you about circles and epiphanies. And you know  an epiphany is usually something you find that you dropped someplace. You've just got to go around the block to see it as an epiphany. That's a painting of a circle. A friend of mine did that    Richard Bollingbroke. It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to tell you about. My circle began back in the '  s in high school in Stow  Ohio where I was the class queer. I was the guy beaten up bloody every week in the boys' room  until one teacher saved my life. She saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom in the teachers' lounge. She did it in secret. She did it for three years. And I had to get out of town. I had a thumb  I had    dollars  and I ended up in San Francisco  California    met a lover    and back in the '  s  found it necessary to begin work on AIDS organizations. About three or four years ago  I got a phone call in the middle of the night from that teacher  Mrs. Posten  who said   I need to see you. I'm disappointed that we never got to know each other as adults. Could you please come to Ohio  and please bring that man that I know you have found by now. And I should mention that I have pancreatic cancer  and I'd like you to please be quick about this.  Well  the next day we were in Cleveland. We took a look at her  we laughed  we cried  and we knew that she needed to be in a hospice. We found her one  we got her there  and we took care of her and watched over her family  because it was necessary. It's something we knew how to do. And just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me  she turned into a box of ashes and was placed in my hands. And what had happened was the circle had closed  it had become a circle    and that epiphany I talked about presented itself. The epiphany is that death is a part of life. She saved my life  I and my partner saved hers. And you know  that part of life needs everything that the rest of life does. It needs truth and beauty  and I'm so happy it's been mentioned so much here today. It also needs    it needs dignity  love and pleasure  and it's our job to hand those things out. Thank you. Space  we all know what it looks like. We've been surrounded by images of space our whole lives  from the speculative images of science fiction to the inspirational visions of artists to the increasingly beautiful pictures made possible by complex technologies. But whilst we have an overwhelmingly vivid visual understanding of space  we have no sense of what space sounds like. And indeed  most people associate space with silence. But the story of how we came to understand the universe is just as much a story of listening as it is by looking. And yet despite this  hardly any of us have ever heard space. How many of you here could describe the sound of a single planet or star  Well in case you've ever wondered  this is what the Sun sounds like. This is the planet Jupiter. And this is the space probe Cassini pirouetting through the ice rings of Saturn. This is a a highly condensed clump of neutral matter  spinning in the distant universe. So my artistic practice is all about listening to the weird and wonderful noises emitted by the magnificent celestial objects that make up our universe. And you may wonder  how do we know what these sounds are  How can we tell the difference between the sound of the Sun and the sound of a pulsar  Well the answer is the science of radio astronomy. Radio astronomers study radio waves from space using sensitive antennas and receivers  which give them precise information about what an astronomical object is and where it is in our night sky. And just like the signals that we send and receive here on Earth  we can convert these transmissions into sound using simple analog techniques. And therefore  it's through listening that we've come to uncover some of the universe's most important secrets    its scale  what it's made of and even how old it is. So today  I'm going to tell you a short story of the history of the universe through listening. It's punctuated by three quick anecdotes  which show how accidental encounters with strange noises gave us some of the most important information we have about space. Now this story doesn't start with vast telescopes or futuristic spacecraft  but a rather more humble technology    and in fact  the very medium which gave us the telecommunications revolution that we're all part of today  the telephone. It's       it's in Boston  and this is Alexander Graham Bell who was working with Thomas Watson on the invention of the telephone. A key part of their technical set up was a half mile long length of wire  which was thrown across the rooftops of several houses in Boston. The line carried the telephone signals that would later make Bell a household name. But like any long length of charged wire  it also inadvertently became an antenna. Thomas Watson spent hours listening to the strange crackles and hisses and chirps and whistles that his accidental antenna detected. Now you have to remember  this is    years before Heinrich Hertz proved the existence of radio waves       years before Nikola Tesla's four tuned circuit    nearly    years before Marconi's first broadcast. So Thomas Watson wasn't listening to us. We didn't have the technology to transmit. So what were these strange noises  Watson was in fact listening to very low frequency radio emissions caused by nature. Some of the crackles and pops were lightning  but the eerie whistles and curiously melodious chirps had a rather more exotic origin. Using the very first telephone  Watson was in fact dialed into the heavens. As he correctly guessed  some of these sounds were caused by activity on the surface of the Sun. It was a solar wind interacting with our ionosphere that he was listening to    a phenomena which we can see at the extreme northern and southern latitudes of our planet as the aurora. So whilst inventing the technology that would usher in the telecommunications revolution  Watson had discovered that the star at the center of our solar system emitted powerful radio waves. He had accidentally been the first person to tune in to them. Fast forward    years  and Bell and Watson's technology has completely transformed global communications. But going from slinging some wire across rooftops in Boston to laying thousands and thousands of miles of cable on the Atlantic Ocean seabed is no easy matter. And so before long  Bell were looking to new technologies to optimize their revolution. Radio could carry sound without wires. But the medium is lossy    it's subject to a lot of noise and interference. So Bell employed an engineer to study those noises  to try and find out where they came from  with a view towards building the perfect hardware codec  which would get rid of them so they could think about using radio for the purposes of telephony. Most of the noises that the engineer  Karl Jansky  investigated were fairly prosaic in origin. They turned out to be lightning or sources of electrical power. But there was one persistent noise that Jansky couldn't identify  and it seemed to appear in his radio headset four minutes earlier each day. Now any astronomer will tell you  this is the telltale sign of something that doesn't originate from Earth. Jansky had made a historic discovery  that celestial objects could emit radio waves as well as light waves. Fifty years on from Watson's accidental encounter with the Sun  Jansky's careful listening ushered in a new age of space exploration  the radio astronomy age. Over the next few years  astronomers connected up their antennas to loudspeakers and learned about our radio sky  about Jupiter and the Sun  by listening. Let's jump ahead again. It's       and we're back at Bell Labs. And once again  two scientists have got a problem with noise. Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson were using the horn antenna at Bell's Holmdel laboratory to study the Milky Way with extraordinary precision. They were really listening to the galaxy in high fidelity. There was a glitch in their soundtrack. A mysterious persistent noise was disrupting their research. It was in the microwave range  and it appeared to be coming from all directions simultaneously. Now this didn't make any sense  and like any reasonable engineer or scientist  they assumed that the problem must be the technology itself  it must be the dish. There were pigeons roosting in the dish. And so perhaps once they cleaned up the pigeon droppings  get the disk kind of operational again  normal operations would resume. But the noise didn't disappear. The mysterious noise that Penzias and Wilson were listening to turned out to be the oldest and most significant sound that anyone had ever heard. It was cosmic radiation left over from the very birth of the universe. This was the first experimental evidence that the Big Bang existed and the universe was born at a precise moment some   .  billion years ago. So our story ends at the beginning    the beginning of all things  the Big Bang. This is the noise that Penzias and Wilson heard    the oldest sound that you're ever going to hear  the cosmic microwave background radiation left over from the Big Bang. Thanks. My name is Joshua Walters. I'm a performer. But as far as being a performer  I'm also diagnosed bipolar. I reframe that as a positive because the crazier I get onstage  the more entertaining I become. When I was    in San Francisco  I had my breakthrough manic episode in which I thought I was Jesus Christ. Maybe you thought that was scary  but actually there's no amount of drugs you can take that can get you as high as if you think you're Jesus Christ. I was sent to a place  a psych ward  and in the psych ward  everyone is doing their own one man show. There's no audience like this to justify their rehearsal time. They're just practicing. One day they'll get here. Now when I got out  I was diagnosed and I was given medications by a psychiatrist.  Okay  Josh  why don't we give you some    why don't we give you some Zyprexa. Okay  Mmhmm  At least that's what it says on my pen.  Some of you are in the field  I can see. I can feel your noise. The first half of high school was the struggle of the manic episode  and the second half was the overmedications of these drugs  where I was sleeping through high school. The second half was just one big nap  pretty much  in class. When I got out I had a choice. I could either deny my mental illness or embrace my mental skillness. There's a movement going on right now to reframe mental illness as a positive    at least the hypomanic edge part of it. Now if you don't know what hypomania is  it's like an engine that's out of control  maybe a Ferrari engine  with no breaks. Many of the speakers here  many of you in the audience  have that creative edge  if you know what I'm talking about. You're driven to do something that everyone has told you is impossible. And there's a book    John Gartner. John Gartner wrote this book called  The Hypomanic Edge  in which Christopher Columbus and Ted Turner and Steve Jobs and all these business minds have this edge to compete. A different book was written not too long ago in the mid   s called  Touched With Fire  by Kay Redfield Jamison in which it was looked at in a creative sense in which Mozart and Beethoven and Van Gogh all have this manic depression that they were suffering with. Some of them committed suicide. So it wasn't all the good side of the illness. Now recently  there's been development in this field. And there was an article written in the New York Times  September       that stated   Just Manic Enough.  Just be manic enough in which investors who are looking for entrepreneurs that have this kind of spectrum    you know what I'm talking about    not maybe full bipolar  but they're in the bipolar spectrum    where on one side  maybe you think you're Jesus  and on the other side maybe they just make you a lot of money. Your call. Your call. And everyone's somewhere in the middle. Everyone's somewhere in the middle. So maybe  you know  there's no such thing as crazy  and being diagnosed with a mental illness doesn't mean you're crazy. But maybe it just means you're more sensitive to what most people can't see or feel. Maybe no one's really crazy. Everyone is just a little bit mad. How much depends on where you fall in the spectrum. How much depends on how lucky you are. Thank you. My name is Emiliano Salinas and I'm going to talk about the role we members of society play in the violent atmosphere this country is living in right now. I was born in     . I grew up in a traditional Mexican family. As a child  I had a pretty normal life  I would go to school  play with my friends and cousins. But then my father became President of Mexico and my life changed. What I'm about to say  at least some of what I'm about to say  will cause controversy. Firstly  because I'm the one who's going to say it. And secondly  because what I'm going to say is true  and it will make a lot of people nervous because it's something we don't want to hear. But it's imperative that we listen because it's undeniable and definitive. It will also make members of criminal organizations nervous for the same reasons. I'm going to talk about the role we members of society play in this phenomenon  and about four different response levels we citizens have against violence. I know many will find it difficult to separate the fact that I'm Carlos Salinas de Gortari's son from the fact that I'm a citizen concerned about the country's current situation. Don't worry. It's not necessary for understanding the importance of what I'm going to say. I think we have a problem in Mexico. We have a big problem. I think there's consensus on this. No one argues    we all agree there's a problem. What we don't agree on is what the problem actually is. Is it the Zetas  The drug traffickers  The government  Corruption  Poverty  Or is it something else  I think none of these is the problem. I don't mean they don't deserve attention. But we won't be able to take care of any of those things if we don't solve the real problem we have in Mexico first. The real problem we have is most of us Mexicans  we believe we are victims of our circumstances. We are a country of victims. Historically  we've always acted as victims of something or somebody. We were victims of the Spaniards. Then we were victims of the French. Then we were victims of Don Porfirio. Then we were victims of the PRI. Even of Salinas. And of El Peje. And now of the Zetas and the traffickers and the criminals and the kidnappers ... Hold on  Wait a minute  What if none of these things is the problem  The problem is not the things we feel victims of. The problem is that we play the role of victims. We need to open our eyes and see that we are not victims. If only we stopped feeling like victims  if we stopped acting as victims  our country would change so much  I'm going to talk about how to go from a society that acts as a victim of circumstances to a responsible  involved society that takes the future of its country in its own hands. I'm going to talk about four different levels of civil response against violence  from weakest to strongest. The first level  the weakest level of civil response against violence  is denial and apathy. Today  much of Mexican society is in denial of the situation we're going through. We want to go on with our daily life even though we are not living under normal circumstances. Daily life in our country is  to say the least  under extraordinary  exceptional circumstances. It's like someone who has a serious illness and pretends it's the flu and it will just go away. We want to pretend that Mexico has the flu. But it doesn't. Mexico has cancer. And if we don't do something about it  the cancer will end up killing it. We need to move Mexican society from denial and apathy to the next level of citizen response  which is  effectively  recognition. And that recognition will sow fear    recognizing the seriousness of the situation. But  fear is better than apathy because fear makes us do something. Many people in Mexico are afraid today. We're very afraid. And we're acting out of that fear. And let me tell you what the problem is with acting out of fear    and this is the second level of civil response  fear. Let's think about Mexican streets  they're unsafe because of violence  so people stay at home. Does that make streets more or less safe  Less safe  So streets become more desolate and unsafe  so we stay home more    which makes streets even more desolate and unsafe  and we stay home even more. This vicious circle ends up with the whole population stuck inside their houses  scared to death    even more afraid than when we were out on the streets. We need to confront this fear. We need to move Mexican society  the members of society who are at this level  to the next level  which is action. We need to face our fears and take back our streets  our cities  our neighborhoods. For many people  acting involves courage. We go from fear to courage. They say   I can't take it anymore. Let's do something about it.  Recently    this is a sensitive figure       public lynchings have been recorded so far in      in Mexico. Usually it's one or two a year. Now we're experiencing one every week. This shows that society is desperate and it's taking the law into its own hands. Unfortunately  violent action    though action is better than no action    but taking part in it only disguises violence. If I'm violent with you and you respond with violence  you become part of the violence and you just disguise my violence. So civil action is vital  but it's also vital to take people who are at the level of courage and violent action to the next level  which is non violent action. It's pacific  coordinated civil action  which doesn't mean passive action. It means it's determined and effective  but not violent. There are examples of this kind of action in Mexico. Two years ago  in Galena City  Chihuahua  a member of the community was kidnapped  Eric Le Bar n. His brothers  Benjam n and Juli n  got together with the rest of the community to think of the best course of action  to pay the ransom  to take up arms and go after the kidnappers or to ask the government for help. In the end  Benjam n and Juli n decided the best thing they could do was to organize the community and act together. So what did they do  They mobilized the whole community of Le Bar n to go to Chihuahua  where they organized a sit in in the central park of the city. They sent a message to the kidnappers   If you want your ransom come and get it. We'll be waiting for you right here.  They stayed there. Seven days later  Eric was set free and was able to return home. This is an example of what an organized society can do  a society that acts. Of course  criminals can respond. And in this case  they did. On July  th        Benjam n Le Bar n was murdered. But Juli n Le Bar n keeps working and he has been mobilizing communities in Chihuahua for over a year. And for over a year he has known that a price has been put on his head. But he keeps fighting. He keeps organizing. He keeps mobilizing. These heroic acts are present all over the country. With a thousand Juli ns working together  Mexico would be a very different country. And they're out there  They just have to raise their hands. I was born in Mexico  I grew up in Mexico and along the way  I learned to love Mexico. I think anyone who has stepped foot on this land    not to mention all Mexican people    will agree that it's not difficult to love Mexico. I've traveled a lot and nowhere else have I found the passion Mexicans have. That devotion we feel for the national football team. That devotion we show in helping victims of disasters  such as the earthquake in      or this year's floods. The passion with which we've been singing the national anthem since we were kids. When we thought Masiosare was the strange enemy  and we sang  with a childlike heart   a soldier in each son.  I think the biggest insult  the worst way you can offend a Mexican is to insult their mother. A mother is the most sacred thing in life. Mexico is our mother and today she cries out for her children. We are going through the darkest moment in our recent history. Our mother  Mexico  is being violated before our very eyes. What are we going to do  Masiosare  the strange enemy  is here. Where is the soldier in each son  Mahatma Gandhi  one of the greatest civil fighters of all time  said   Be the change you wish to see in the world.  Today in Mexico we're asking for Gandhis. We need Gandhis. We need men and women who love Mexico and who are willing to take action. This is a call for every true Mexican to join this initiative. This is a call so that every single thing we love about Mexico    the festivals  the markets  the restaurants  the cantinas  the tequila  the mariachis  the serenades  the posadas  El Grito  the Day of the Dead  San Miguel  the joy  the passion for life  the fight and everything it means to be Mexican    doesn't disappear from this world. We're facing a very powerful opponent. But we are many more. They can take a man's life. Anyone can kill me  or you  or you. But no one can kill the spirit of true Mexicans. The battle is won  but we still have to fight it.      years ago  the Roman poet Juvenal said something that today echoes in the heart of every true Mexican. He said   Count it the greatest sin to prefer life to honor  and for the sake of living to lose what makes life worth living.  Thank you. I'd like to begin with a thought experiment. Imagine that it's       years into the future. Civilization as we know it has ceased to exist    no books  no electronic devices  no Facebook or Twitter. All knowledge of the English language and the English alphabet has been lost. Now imagine archeologists digging through the rubble of one of our cities. What might they find  Well perhaps some rectangular pieces of plastic with strange symbols on them. Perhaps some circular pieces of metal. Maybe some cylindrical containers with some symbols on them. And perhaps one archeologist becomes an instant celebrity when she discovers    buried in the hills somewhere in North America    massive versions of these same symbols. Now let's ask ourselves  what could such artifacts say about us to people       years into the future  This is no hypothetical question. In fact  this is exactly the kind of question we're faced with when we try to understand the Indus Valley civilization  which existed       years ago. The Indus civilization was roughly contemporaneous with the much better known Egyptian and the Mesopotamian civilizations  but it was actually much larger than either of these two civilizations. It occupied the area of approximately one million square kilometers  covering what is now Pakistan  Northwestern India and parts of Afghanistan and Iran. Given that it was such a vast civilization  you might expect to find really powerful rulers  kings  and huge monuments glorifying these powerful kings. In fact  what archeologists have found is none of that. They've found small objects such as these. Here's an example of one of these objects. Well obviously this is a replica. But who is this person  A king  A god  A priest  Or perhaps an ordinary person like you or me  We don't know. But the Indus people also left behind artifacts with writing on them. Well no  not pieces of plastic  but stone seals  copper tablets  pottery and  surprisingly  one large sign board  which was found buried near the gate of a city. Now we don't know if it says Hollywood  or even Bollywood for that matter. In fact  we don't even know what any of these objects say  and that's because the Indus script is undeciphered. We don't know what any of these symbols mean. The symbols are most commonly found on seals. So you see up there one such object. It's the square object with the unicorn like animal on it. Now that's a magnificent piece of art. So how big do you think that is  Perhaps that big  Or maybe that big  Well let me show you. Here's a replica of one such seal. It's only about one inch by one inch in size    pretty tiny. So what were these used for  We know that these were used for stamping clay tags that were attached to bundles of goods that were sent from one place to the other. So you know those packing slips you get on your FedEx boxes  These were used to make those kinds of packing slips. You might wonder what these objects contain in terms of their text. Perhaps they're the name of the sender or some information about the goods that are being sent from one place to the other    we don't know. We need to decipher the script to answer that question. Deciphering the script is not just an intellectual puzzle  it's actually become a question that's become deeply intertwined with the politics and the cultural history of South Asia. In fact  the script has become a battleground of sorts between three different groups of people. First  there's a group of people who are very passionate in their belief that the Indus script does not represent a language at all. These people believe that the symbols are very similar to the kind of symbols you find on traffic signs or the emblems you find on shields. There's a second group of people who believe that the Indus script represents an Indo European language. If you look at a map of India today  you'll see that most of the languages spoken in North India belong to the Indo European language family. So some people believe that the Indus script represents an ancient Indo European language such as Sanskrit. There's a last group of people who believe that the Indus people were the ancestors of people living in South India today. These people believe that the Indus script represents an ancient form of the Dravidian language family  which is the language family spoken in much of South India today. And the proponents of this theory point to that small pocket of Dravidian speaking people in the North  actually near Afghanistan  and they say that perhaps  sometime in the past  Dravidian languages were spoken all over India and that this suggests that the Indus civilization is perhaps also Dravidian. Which of these hypotheses can be true  We don't know  but perhaps if you deciphered the script  you would be able to answer this question. But deciphering the script is a very challenging task. First  there's no Rosetta Stone. I don't mean the software  I mean an ancient artifact that contains in the same text both a known text and an unknown text. We don't have such an artifact for the Indus script. And furthermore  we don't even know what language they spoke. And to make matters even worse  most of the text that we have are extremely short. So as I showed you  they're usually found on these seals that are very  very tiny. And so given these formidable obstacles  one might wonder and worry whether one will ever be able to decipher the Indus script. In the rest of my talk  I'd like to tell you about how I learned to stop worrying and love the challenge posed by the Indus script. I've always been fascinated by the Indus script ever since I read about it in a middle school textbook. And why was I fascinated  Well it's the last major undeciphered script in the ancient world. My career path led me to become a computational neuroscientist  so in my day job  I create computer models of the brain to try to understand how the brain makes predictions  how the brain makes decisions  how the brain learns and so on. But in       my path crossed again with the Indus script. That's when I was in India  and I had the wonderful opportunity to meet with some Indian scientists who were using computer models to try to analyze the script. And so it was then that I realized there was an opportunity for me to collaborate with these scientists  and so I jumped at that opportunity. And I'd like to describe some of the results that we have found. Or better yet  let's all collectively decipher. Are you ready  The first thing that you need to do when you have an undeciphered script is try to figure out the direction of writing. Here are two texts that contain some symbols on them. Can you tell me if the direction of writing is right to left or left to right  I'll give you a couple of seconds. Okay. Right to left  how many  Okay. Okay. Left to right  Oh  it's almost      . Okay. The answer is  if you look at the left hand side of the two texts  you'll notice that there's a cramping of signs  and it seems like       years ago  when the scribe was writing from right to left  they ran out of space. And so they had to cram the sign. One of the signs is also below the text on the top. This suggests the direction of writing was probably from right to left  and so that's one of the first things we know  that directionality is a very key aspect of linguistic scripts. And the Indus script now has this particular property. What other properties of language does the script show  Languages contain patterns. If I give you the letter Q and ask you to predict the next letter  what do you think that would be  Most of you said U  which is right. Now if I asked you to predict one more letter  what do you think that would be  Now there's several thoughts. There's E. It could be I. It could be A  but certainly not B  C or D  right  The Indus script also exhibits similar kinds of patterns. There's a lot of text that start with this diamond shaped symbol. And this in turn tends to be followed by this quotation marks like symbol. And this is very similar to a Q and U example. This symbol can in turn be followed by these fish like symbols and some other signs  but never by these other signs at the bottom. And furthermore  there's some signs that really prefer the end of texts  such as this jar shaped sign  and this sign  in fact  happens to be the most frequently occurring sign in the script. Given such patterns  here was our idea. The idea was to use a computer to learn these patterns  and so we gave the computer the existing texts. And the computer learned a statistical model of which symbols tend to occur together and which symbols tend to follow each other. Given the computer model  we can test the model by essentially quizzing it. So we could deliberately erase some symbols  and we can ask it to predict the missing symbols. Here are some examples. You may regard this as perhaps the most ancient game of Wheel of Fortune. What we found was that the computer was successful in    percent of the cases in predicting the correct symbol. In the rest of the cases  typically the second best guess or third best guess was the right answer. There's also practical use for this particular procedure. There's a lot of these texts that are damaged. Here's an example of one such text. And we can use the computer model now to try to complete this text and make a best guess prediction. Here's an example of a symbol that was predicted. And this could be really useful as we try to decipher the script by generating more data that we can analyze. Now here's one other thing you can do with the computer model. So imagine a monkey sitting at a keyboard. I think you might get a random jumble of letters that looks like this. Such a random jumble of letters is said to have a very high entropy. This is a physics and information theory term. But just imagine it's a really random jumble of letters. How many of you have ever spilled coffee on a keyboard  You might have encountered the stuck key problem    so basically the same symbol being repeated over and over again. This kind of a sequence is said to have a very low entropy because there's no variation at all. Language  on the other hand  has an intermediate level of entropy  it's neither too rigid  nor is it too random. What about the Indus script  Here's a graph that plots the entropies of a whole bunch of sequences. At the very top you find the uniformly random sequence  which is a random jumble of letters    and interestingly  we also find the DNA sequence from the human genome and instrumental music. And both of these are very  very flexible  which is why you find them in the very high range. At the lower end of the scale  you find a rigid sequence  a sequence of all A's  and you also find a computer program  in this case in the language Fortran  which obeys really strict rules. Linguistic scripts occupy the middle range. Now what about the Indus script  We found that the Indus script actually falls within the range of the linguistic scripts. When this result was first published  it was highly controversial. There were people who raised a hue and cry  and these people were the ones who believed that the Indus script does not represent language. I even started to get some hate mail. My students said that I should really seriously consider getting some protection. Who'd have thought that deciphering could be a dangerous profession  What does this result really show  It shows that the Indus script shares an important property of language. So  as the old saying goes  if it looks like a linguistic script and it acts like a linguistic script  then perhaps we may have a linguistic script on our hands. What other evidence is there that the script could actually encode language  Well linguistic scripts can actually encode multiple languages. So for example  here's the same sentence written in English and the same sentence written in Dutch using the same letters of the alphabet. If you don't know Dutch and you only know English and I give you some words in Dutch  you'll tell me that these words contain some very unusual patterns. Some things are not right  and you'll say these words are probably not English words. The same thing happens in the case of the Indus script. The computer found several texts    two of them are shown here    that have very unusual patterns. So for example the first text  there's a doubling of this jar shaped sign. This sign is the most frequently occurring sign in the Indus script  and it's only in this text that it occurs as a doubling pair. Why is that the case  We went back and looked at where these particular texts were found  and it turns out that they were found very  very far away from the Indus Valley. They were found in present day Iraq and Iran. And why were they found there  What I haven't told you is that the Indus people were very  very enterprising. They used to trade with people pretty far away from where they lived  and so in this case  they were traveling by sea all the way to Mesopotamia  present day Iraq. And what seems to have happened here is that the Indus traders  the merchants  were using this script to write a foreign language. It's just like our English and Dutch example. And that would explain why we have these strange patterns that are very different from the kinds of patterns you see in the text that are found within the Indus Valley. This suggests that the same script  the Indus script  could be used to write different languages. The results we have so far seem to point to the conclusion that the Indus script probably does represent language. If it does represent language  then how do we read the symbols  That's our next big challenge. So you'll notice that many of the symbols look like pictures of humans  of insects  of fishes  of birds. Most ancient scripts use the rebus principle  which is  using pictures to represent words. So as an example  here's a word. Can you write it using pictures  I'll give you a couple seconds. Got it  Okay. Great. Here's my solution. You could use the picture of a bee followed by a picture of a leaf    and that's  belief   right. There could be other solutions. In the case of the Indus script  the problem is the reverse. You have to figure out the sounds of each of these pictures such that the entire sequence makes sense. So this is just like a crossword puzzle  except that this is the mother of all crossword puzzles because the stakes are so high if you solve it. My colleagues  Iravatham Mahadevan and Asko Parpola  have been making some headway on this particular problem. And I'd like to give you a quick example of Parpola's work. Here's a really short text. It contains seven vertical strokes followed by this fish like sign. And I want to mention that these seals were used for stamping clay tags that were attached to bundles of goods  so it's quite likely that these tags  at least some of them  contain names of merchants. And it turns out that in India there's a long tradition of names being based on horoscopes and star constellations present at the time of birth. In Dravidian languages  the word for fish is  meen  which happens to sound just like the word for star. And so seven stars would stand for  elu meen   which is the Dravidian word for the Big Dipper star constellation. Similarly  there's another sequence of six stars  and that translates to  aru meen   which is the old Dravidian name for the star constellation Pleiades. And finally  there's other combinations  such as this fish sign with something that looks like a roof on top of it. And that could be translated into  mey meen   which is the old Dravidian name for the planet Saturn. So that was pretty exciting. It looks like we're getting somewhere. But does this prove that these seals contain Dravidian names based on planets and star constellations  Well not yet. So we have no way of validating these particular readings  but if more and more of these readings start making sense  and if longer and longer sequences appear to be correct  then we know that we are on the right track. Today  we can write a word such as TED in Egyptian hieroglyphics and in cuneiform script  because both of these were deciphered in the   th century. The decipherment of these two scripts enabled these civilizations to speak to us again directly. The Mayans started speaking to us in the   th century  but the Indus civilization remains silent. Why should we care  The Indus civilization does not belong to just the South Indians or the North Indians or the Pakistanis  it belongs to all of us. These are our ancestors    yours and mine. They were silenced by an unfortunate accident of history. If we decipher the script  we would enable them to speak to us again. What would they tell us  What would we find out about them  About us  I can't wait to find out. Thank you. It's an amazing thing that we're here to talk about the year of patients rising. You heard stories earlier today about patients who are taking control of their cases  patients who are saying   You know what  I know what the odds are  but I'm going to go look for more information. I'm going to define what the terms of my success are.  I'm going to be sharing with you how four years ago I almost died    found out I was  in fact  already almost dead. And what I then found out about what's called the e Patient movement    I'll explain what that term means. I had been blogging under the name Patient Dave  and when I discovered this  I just renamed myself e Patient Dave. Regarding the word  patient   when I first started a few years ago getting involved in health care and attending meetings as just a casual observer  I noticed that people would talk about patients as if it was somebody who's not in the room here  somebody out there. Some of our talks today  we still act like that. But I'm here to tell you   patient  is not a third person word. You  yourself  will find yourself in a hospital bed    or your mother  your child    there are heads nodding  people who say   Yes  I know exactly what you mean.  So when you hear what I'm going to talk about here today  first of all  I want to say that I am here on behalf of all the patients that I have ever met  all the ones I haven't met. This is about letting patients play a more active role in helping health care  in fixing health care. One of the senior doctors at my hospital  Charlie Safran  and his colleague  Warner Slack  have been saying for decades that the most underutilized resource in all of health care is the patient. They have been saying that since the     s. Now I'm going to step back in history. This is from July      . I was a freshman in college  and this was when we first landed on the Moon. And it was the first time we had ever seen from another surface    that's the place where you and I are right now  where we live. The world was changing. It was about to change in ways that nobody could foresee. A few weeks later  Woodstock happened. Three days of fun and music. Here  just for historical authenticity  is a picture of me in that year. Yeah  the wavy hair  the blue eyes    it was really something. That Fall of       the Whole Earth Catalog came out. It was a hippie journal of self sufficiency. We think of hippies of being just hedonists  but there's a very strong component    I was in that movement    a very strong component of being responsible for yourself. This book's title's subtitle is   Access to Tools.  And it talked about how to build your own house  how to grow your own food  all kinds of things. In the     s  this young doctor  Tom Ferguson  was the medical editor of the Whole Earth Catalog. And he saw that the great majority of what we do in medicine and health care is taking care of ourselves. In fact  he said it was    to    percent of how we actually take care of our bodies. Well he also saw that when health care turns to medical care because of a more serious disease  the key thing that holds us back is access to information. And when the Web came along  that changed everything  because not only could we find information  we could find other people like ourselves who could gather  who could bring us information. And he coined this term e Patients    equipped  engaged  empowered  enabled. Obviously at this stage of life he was in a somewhat more dignified form than he was back then. Now I was an engaged patient long before I ever heard of the term. In       I went to my doctor for a regular physical  and I had said   I have a sore shoulder.  Well  I got an X ray  and the next morning    you may have noticed  those of you who have been through a medical crisis will understand this. This morning  some of the speakers named the date when they found out about their condition. For me  it was      AM on January        . I was at the office  my desk was clean  I had the blue partition carpet on the walls. The phone rang and it was my doctor. He said   Dave  I pulled up the X ray image on the screen on the computer at home.  He said   Your shoulder's going to be fine  but Dave  there's something in your lung.  And if you look in that red oval  that shadow was not supposed to be there. To make a long story short  I said   So you need me to get back in there   He said   Yeah  we're going to need to do a CT scan of your chest.  And in parting I said   Is there anything I should do   He said    think about this one. This is the advice your doctor gives you   just go home and have a glass of wine with your wife.  I went in for the CAT scan  and it turns out there were five of these things in both my lungs. So at that point we knew that it was cancer. We knew it wasn't lung cancer. That meant it was metastasized from somewhere. The question was  where from  So I went in for an ultrasound. I got to do what many women have    the jelly on the belly and bzzzz. My wife came with me. She's a veterinarian  so she's seen lots of ultrasounds. I mean  she knows I'm not a dog. But what we saw    this is an MRI image. This is much sharper than an ultrasound would be. What we saw in that kidney was that big blob there. And there were actually two of these. One was growing out the front and it had already erupted  and it latched onto the bowel. One was growing out the back  and it attached to the soleus muscle  which is a big muscle in the back that I'd never heard of  but all of a sudden I cared about it. I went home. Now I've been Googling    I've been online since      on CompuServe. I went home  and I know you can't read the details here  that's not important. My point is I went to a respected medical website  WebMD  because I know how to filter out junk. I also found my wife online. Before I met her  I went through some suboptimal search results. So I looked for quality information. There's so much about trust    what sources of information can we trust  Where does my body end and an invader start  And cancer  a tumor  is something you grow out of your own tissue. How does that happen  Where does medical ability end and start  Well  so what I read on WebMD   The prognosis is poor for progressing renal cell cancer. Almost all patients are incurable.  I've been online long enough to know if I don't like the first results I get  I go look for more. And what I found was on other websites  even by the third page of Google results   Outlook is bleak    Prognosis is grim.  And I'm thinking   What the heck   I didn't feel sick at all. I mean  I'd been getting tired in the evening  but I was    years old. I was slowly losing weight  but for me  that was what the doctor told me to do. It was really something. And this is the diagram of stage four kidney cancer from the drug I eventually got. Totally by coincidence  there's that thing in my lung. In the left femur  the left thigh bone  there's another one. I had one. My leg eventually snapped. I fainted and landed on it  and it broke. There's one in the skull  and then just for good measure  I had these other tumors    including  by the time my treatment started  one was growing out of my tongue. I had kidney cancer growing out of my tongue. And what I read was that my median survival was    weeks. This was bad. I was facing the grave. I thought   What's my mother's face going to look like on the day of my funeral   I had to sit down with my daughter and say   Here's the situation.  Her boyfriend was with her. I said   I don't want you guys to get married prematurely just so you can do it while Dad's still alive.  It's really serious. Because if you wonder why patients are motivated and want to help  think about this. Well  my doctor prescribed a patient community  Acor.org  a network of cancer patients  of all amazing things. Very quickly they told me   Kidney cancer is an uncommon disease. Get yourself to a specialist center. There is no cure  but there's something that sometimes works    it usually doesn't    called high dosage interleukin. Most hospitals don't offer it  so they won't even tell you it exists. And don't let them give you anything else first. And by the way  here are four doctors in your part of the United States who offer it and their phone numbers.  How amazing is that  Here's the thing. Here we are  four years later  you can't find a website that gives patients that information. Government approved  American Cancer Society  but patients know what patients want to know. It's the power of patient networks. This amazing substance    again I mentioned  where does my body end  My oncologist and I talk a lot these days because I try to keep my talks technically accurate. And he said   You know  the immune system is good at detecting invaders    bacteria coming from outside    but when it's your own tissue that you've grown  it's a whole different thing.  And I went through a mental exercise actually  because I started a patient support community of my own on a website  and one of my friends  one of my relatives actually  said   Look  Dave  who grew this thing  Are you going to set yourself up as mentally attacking yourself   So we went into it. And the story of how all that happens is in this book. Anyway  this is the way the numbers unfolded. Me being me  I put the numbers from my hospital's website from my tumor sizes into a spreadsheet. Don't worry about the numbers. You see  that's the immune system. Amazing thing  those two yellow lines are where I got the two doses of interleukin two months apart. And look at how the tumor sizes plummeted in between. Just incredible. Who knows what we'll be able to do when we learn to make more use of it. The punch line is that a year and a half later  I was there when this magnificent young woman  my daughter  got married. And when she came down those steps  and it was just her and me for that moment  I was so glad that she didn't have to say to her mother   I wish Dad could have been here.  And this is what we're doing when we make health care better. Now I want to talk briefly about a couple of other patients who are doing everything in their power to improve health care. This is Regina Holliday  a painter in Washington D.C.  whose husband died of kidney cancer a year after my disease. She's painting here a mural of his horrible final weeks in the hospital. One of the things that she discovered was that her husband's medical record in this paper folder was just disorganized. And she thought   You know  if I have a nutrition facts label on the side of a cereal box  why can't there be something that simple telling every new nurse who comes on duty  every new doctor  the basics about my husband's condition   So she painted this medical facts mural with a nutrition label  something like that  in a diagram of him. She then  last year  painted this diagram. She studied health care like me. She came to realize that there were a lot of people who'd written patient advocate books that you just don't hear about at medical conferences. Patients are such an underutilized resource. Well as it says in my introduction  I've gotten somewhat known for saying that patients should have access to their data. And I actually said at one conference a couple of years ago   Give me my damn data  because you people can't be trusted to keep it clean.  And here she has our damned data    it's a pun    which is starting to break out  starting to break through    the water symbolizes our data. And in fact  I want to do a little something improvisational for you here. There's a guy on Twitter that I know  a health IT guy outside Boston  and he wrote the e Patient rap. And it goes like this.   Gimme my damn data     I want to be an e Patient just like Dave     Gimme my damn data  cuz it's my life to save   Now I'm not going to go any further. Well thank you. That shot the timing. Think about the possibility  why is it that iPhones and iPads advance far faster than the health tools that are available to you to help take care of your family  Here's a website  VisibleBody.com  that I stumbled across. And I thought   You know  I wonder what my soleus muscle is   So you can click on things and remove it. And I saw   Aha  that's the kidney and the soleus muscle.  And I was rotating it in  D and saying   I understand now.  And then I realized it reminded me of Google Earth  where you can fly to any address. And I thought   Why not take this and connect it to my digital scan data and have Google Earth for my body   What did Google come out with this year  Now there's Google Body browser. But you see  it's still generic. It's not my data. But if we can get that data out from behind the dam so software innovators can pounce on it  the way software innovators like to do  who knows what we'll be able to come up with. One final story  this is Kelly Young  a rheumatoid arthritis patient from Florida. This is a live story unfolding just in the last few weeks. RA patients  as they call themselves    her blog is RA Warrior    have a big problem because    percent of them have no visible symptoms. And that makes it just really hard to tell how the disease is going. And some doctors think   Yeah right  you're really in pain.  Well she found  through her online research  a nuclear bone scan that's usually used for cancer  but it can also reveal inflammation. And she saw that if there is no inflammation then the scan is a uniform gray. So she took it. And the radiologist report said   No cancer found.  Well that's not what he was supposed to do with it. So she had it read again  she wanted to have it read again  and her doctor fired her. She pulled up the CD. He said   If you don't want to follow my instructions  go away.  So she pulled up the CD of the scan images  and look at all those hot spots. And she's now actively engaged on her blog in looking for assistance in getting better care. See  that is an empowered patient    no medical training. We are  you are  the most underused resource in health care. What she was able to do was because she had access to the raw data. How big a deal was this  Well at TED      Tim Berners Lee himself  inventor of the Web  gave a talk where he said the next big thing is not to have your browser go out and find other people's articles about the data  but the raw data. And he got them chanting by the end of the talk   Raw data now. Raw data now.  And I ask you  three words  please  to improve health care  let patients help. Let patients help. Let patients help. Let patients help. Thank you. For all the patients around the world watching this on the webcast  God bless you  everyone    let patients help. Host  And bless yourself. Thank you very much. The Highline is an old  elevated rail line that runs for a mile and a half right through Manhattan. And it was originally a freight line that ran down   th Ave. And it became known as  Death Avenue  because so many people were run over by the trains that the railroad hired a guy on horseback to run in front  and he became known as the  West Side Cowboy.  But even with a cowboy  about one person a month was killed and run over. So they elevated it. They built it    ft. in the air  right through the middle of the city. But with the rise of interstate trucking  it was used less and less. And by       the last train rode. It was a train loaded with frozen turkeys    they say  at Thanksgiving    from the meatpacking district. And then it was abandoned. And I live in the neighborhood  and I first read about it in the New York Times  in an article that said it was going to be demolished. And I assumed someone was working to preserve it or save it and I could volunteer  but I realized no one was doing anything. I went to my first community board meeting    which I'd never been to one before    and sat next to another guy named Joshua David  who's a travel writer. And at the end of the meeting  we realized we were the only two people that were sort of interested in the project  most people wanted to tear it down. So we exchanged business cards  and we kept calling each other and decided to start this organization  Friends of the High Line. And the goal at first was just saving it from demolition  but then we also wanted to figure out what we could do with it. And what first attracted me  or interested me  was this view from the street    which is this steel structure  sort of rusty  this industrial relic. But when I went up on top  it was a mile and a half of wildflowers running right through the middle of Manhattan with views of the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty and the Hudson River. And that's really where we started  the idea coalesced around  let's make this a park  and let's have it be sort of inspired by this wildscape. At the time  there was a lot of opposition. Mayor Giuliani wanted to tear it down. I'm going to fast forward through a lot of lawsuits and a lot of community engagement. Mayor Bloomberg came in office  he was very supportive  but we still had to make the economic case. This was after       the city was in tough times. So we commissioned an economic feasibility study to try to make the case. And it turns out  we got those numbers wrong. We thought it would cost     million dollars to build. So far it's cost about     million. And the main case was  this is going to make good economic sense for the city. So we said over a    year time period  the value to the city in increased property values and increased taxes would be about     million. That was enough. It really got the city behind it. It turns out we were wrong on that. Now people estimate it's created about a half a billion dollars  or will create about a half a billion dollars  in tax revenues for the city. We did a design competition  selected a design team. We worked with them to really create a design that was inspired by that wildscape. There's three sections. We opened the fist section in     . It's been successful beyond our dreams. Last year we had about two million people  which is about    times what we ever estimated. This is one of my favorite features in section one. It's this amphitheater right over   th Ave. And the first section ends at   th St. right now. The other thing  it's generated  obviously  a lot of economic value  it's also inspired  I think  a lot of great architecture. There's a point  you can stand here and see buildings by Frank Gehry  Jean Nouvel  Shigeru Ban  Neil Denari. And the Whitney is moving downtown and is building their new museum right at the base of the High Line. And this has been designed by Renzo Piano. And they're going to break ground in May. And we've already started construction on section two. This is one of my favorite features  this flyover where you're eight feet off the surface of the High Line  running through a canopy of trees. The High Line used to be covered in billboards  and so we've taken a playful take where  instead of framing advertisements  it's going to frame people in views of the city. This was just installed last month. And then the last section was going to go around the rail yards  which is the largest undeveloped site in Manhattan. And the city has planned    for better or for worse       million square feet of development that the High Line is going to ring around. But what really  I think  makes the High Line special is the people. And honestly  even though I love the designs that we were building  I was always frightened that I wouldn't really love it  because I fell in love with that wildscape    and how could you recreate that magic  But what I found is it's in the people and how they use it that  to me  makes it so special. Just one quick example is I realized right after we opened that there were all these people holding hands on the High Line. And I realized New Yorkers don't hold hands  we just don't do that outside. But you see that happening on the High Line  and I think that's the power that public space can have to transform how people experience their city and interact with each other. Thanks.
