I'm going to talk about the power of a word  jihad. To the vast majority of practicing Muslims  jihad is an internal struggle for the faith. It is a struggle within  a struggle against vice  sin  temptation  lust  greed. It is a struggle to try and live a life that is set by the moral codes written in the Koran. In that original idea  the concept of jihad is as important to Muslims as the idea of grace is to Christians. It's a very powerful word  jihad  if you look at it in that respect  and there's a certain almost mystical resonance to it. And that's the reason why  for hundreds of years  Muslims everywhere have named their children Jihad  their daughters as much as their sons  in the same way that  say  Christians name their daughters Grace  and Hindus  my people  name our daughters Bhakti  which means  in Sanskrit  spiritual worship. But there have always been  in Islam  a small group  a minority  who believe that jihad is not only an internal struggle but also an external struggle against forces that would threaten the faith  or the faithul. And some of these people believe that in that struggle  it is sometimes okay to take up arms. And so the thousands of young Muslim men who flocked to Afghanistan in the     s to fight against the Soviet occupation of a Muslim country  in their minds they were fighting a jihad  they were doing jihad  and they named themselves the Mujahideen  which is a word that comes from the same root as jihad. And we forget this now  but back then the Mujahideen were celebrated in this country  in America. We thought of them as holy warriors who were taking the good fight to the ungodly communists. America gave them weapons  gave them money  gave them support  encouragement. But within that group  a tiny  smaller group  a minority within a minority within a minority  were coming up with a new and dangerous conception of jihad  and in time this group would come to be led by Osama bin Laden  and he refined the idea. His idea of jihad was a global war of terror  primarily targeted at the far enemy  at the crusaders from the West  against America. And the things he did in the pursuit of this jihad were so horrendous  so monstrous  and had such great impact  that his definition was the one that stuck  not just here in the West. We didn't know any better. We didn't pause to ask. We just assumed that if this insane man and his psychopathic followers were calling what they did jihad  then that's what jihad must mean. But it wasn't just us. Even in the Muslim world  his definition of jihad began to gain acceptance. A year ago I was in Tunis  and I met the imam of a very small mosque  an old man. Fifteen years ago  he named his granddaughter Jihad  after the old meaning. He hoped that a name like that would inspire her to live a spiritual life. But he told me that after       he began to have second thoughts. He worried that if he called her by that name  especially outdoors  outside in public  he might be seen as endorsing bin Laden's idea of jihad. On Fridays in his mosque  he gave sermons trying to reclaim the meaning of the word  but his congregants  the people who came to his mosque  they had seen the videos. They had seen pictures of the planes going into the towers  the towers coming down. They had heard bin Laden say that that was jihad  and claimed victory for it. And so the old imam worried that his words were falling on deaf ears. No one was paying attention. He was wrong. Some people were paying attention  but for the wrong reasons. The United States  at this point  was putting pressure on all its Arab allies  including Tunisia  to stamp out extremism in their societies  and this imam found himself suddenly in the crosshairs of the Tunisian intelligence service. They had never paid him any attention before    old man  small mosque    but now they began to pay visits  and sometimes they would drag him in for questions  and always the same question   Why did you name your granddaughter Jihad  Why do you keep using the word jihad in your Friday sermons  Do you hate Americans  What is your connection to Osama bin Laden   So to the Tunisian intelligence agency  and organizations like it all over the Arab world  jihad equaled extremism  Bin Laden's definition had become institutionalized. That was the power of that word that he was able to do. And it filled this old imam  it filled him with great sadness. He told me that  of bin Laden's many crimes  this was  in his mind  one that didn't get enough attention  that he took this word  this beautiful idea. He didn't so much appropriate it as kidnapped it and debased it and corrupted it and turned it into something it was never meant to be  and then persuaded all of us that it always was a global jihad. But the good news is that the global jihad is almost over  as bin Laden defined it. It was dying well before he did  and now it's on its last legs. Opinion polls from all over the Muslim world show that there is very little interest among Muslims in a global holy war against the West  against the far enemy. The supply of young men willing to fight and die for this cause is dwindling. The supply of money   just as important  more important perhaps   the supply of money to this activity is also dwindling. The wealthy fanatics who were previously sponsoring this kind of activity are now less generous. What does that mean for us in the West  Does it mean we can break out the champagne  wash our hands of it  disengage  sleep easy at night  No. Disengagement is not an option  because if you let local jihad survive  it becomes international jihad. And so there's now a lot of different violent jihads all over the world. In Somalia  in Mali  in Nigeria  in Iraq  in Afghanistan  Pakistan  there are groups that claim to be the inheritors of the legacy of Osama bin Laden. They use his rhetoric. They even use the brand name he created for his jihad. So there is now an al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb  there's an al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula  there is an al Qaeda in Mesopotamia. There are other groups    in Nigeria  Boko Haram  in Somalia  al Shabaab    and they all pay homage to Osama bin Laden. But if you look closely  they're not fighting a global jihad. They're fighting battles over much narrower issues. Usually it has to do with ethnicity or race or sectarianism  or it's a power struggle. More often than not  it's a power struggle in one country  or even a small region within one country. Occasionally they will go across a border  from Iraq to Syria  from Mali to Algeria  from Somalia to Kenya  but they're not fighting a global jihad against some far enemy. But that doesn't mean that we can relax. I was in Yemen recently  where    it's the home of the last al Qaeda franchise that still aspires to attack America  attack the West. It's old school al Qaeda. You may remember these guys. They are the ones who tried to send the underwear bomber here  and they were using the Internet to try and instigate violence among American Muslims. But they have been distracted recently. Last year  they took control over a portion of southern Yemen  and ran it  Taliban style. And then the Yemeni military got its act together  and ordinary people rose up against these guys and drove them out  and since then  most of their activities  most of their attacks have been directed at Yemenis. So I think we've come to a point now where we can say that  just like all politics  all jihad is local. But that's still not reason for us to disengage  because we've seen that movie before  in Afghanistan. When those Mujahideen defeated the Soviet Union  we disengaged. And even before the fizz had gone out of our celebratory champagne  the Taliban had taken over in Kabul  and we said   Local jihad  not our problem.  And then the Taliban gave the keys of Kandahar to Osama bin Laden. He made it our problem. Local jihad  if you ignore it  becomes global jihad again. The good news is that it doesn't have to be. We know how to fight it now. We have the tools. We have the knowhow  and we can take the lessons we've learned from the fight against global jihad  the victory against global jihad  and apply those to local jihad. What are those lessons  We know who killed bin Laden  SEAL Team Six. Do we know  do we understand  who killed bin Ladenism  Who ended the global jihad  There lie the answers to the solution to local jihad. Who killed bin Ladenism  Let's start with bin Laden himself. He probably thought      was his greatest achievement. In reality  it was the beginning of the end for him. He killed       innocent people  and that filled the Muslim world with horror and revulsion  and what that meant was that his idea of jihad could never become mainstream. He condemned himself to operating on the lunatic fringes of his own community.      didn't empower him  it doomed him. Who killed bin Ladenism  Abu Musab al Zarqawi killed it. He was the especially sadistic head of al Qaeda in Iraq who sent hundreds of suicide bombers to attack not Americans but Iraqis. Muslims. Sunni as well as Shiites. Any claim that al Qaeda had to being protectors of Islam against the Western crusaders was drowned in the blood of Iraqi Muslims. Who killed Osama bin Laden  The SEAL Team Six. Who killed bin Ladenism  Al Jazeera did  Al Jazeera and half a dozen other satellite news stations in Arabic  because they circumvented the old  state owned television stations in a lot of these countries which were designed to keep information from people. Al Jazeera brought information to them  showed them what was being said and done in the name of their religion  exposed the hypocrisy of Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda  and allowed them  gave them the information that allowed them to come to their own conclusions. Who killed bin Ladenism  The Arab Spring did  because it showed a way for young Muslims to bring about change in a manner that Osama bin Laden  with his limited imagination  could never have conceived. Who defeated the global jihad  The American military did  the American soldiers did  with their allies  fighting in faraway battlefields. And perhaps  a time will come when they get the rightful credit for it. So all these factors  and many more besides  we don't even fully understand some of them yet  these came together to defeat a monstrosity as big as bin Ladenism  the global jihad  you needed this group effort. Now  not all of these things will work in local jihad. The American military is not going to march into Nigeria to take on Boko Haram  and it's unlikely that SEAL Team Six will rappel into the homes of al Shabaab's leaders and take them out. But many of these other factors that were in play are now even stronger than before. Half the work is already done. We don't have to reinvent the wheel. The notion of violent jihad in which more Muslims are killed than any other kind of people is already thoroughly discredited. We don't have to go back to that. Satellite television and the Internet are informing and empowering young Muslims in exciting new ways. And the Arab Spring has produced governments  many of them Islamist governments  who know that  for their own self preservation  they need to take on the extremists in their midsts. We don't need to persuade them  but we do need to help them  because they haven't really come to this place before. The good news  again  is that a lot of the things they need we already have  and we are very good at giving  economic assistance  not just money  but expertise  technology  knowhow  private investment  fair terms of trade  medicine  education  technical support for training for their police forces to become more effective  for their anti terror forces to become more efficient. We've got plenty of these things. Some of the other things that they need we're not very good at giving. Maybe nobody is. Time  patience  subtlety  understanding    these are harder to give. I live in New York now. Just this week  posters have gone up in subway stations in New York that describe jihad as savage. But in all the many years that I have covered the Middle East  I have never been as optimistic as I am today that the gap between the Muslim world and the West is narrowing fast  and one of the many reasons for my optimism is that  because I know there are millions  hundreds of millions of people  Muslims like that old imam in Tunis  who are reclaiming this word and restoring to its original  beautiful purpose. Bin Laden is dead. Bin Ladenism has been defeated. His definition of jihad can now be expunged. To that jihad we can say   Goodbye. Good riddance.  To the real jihad we can say   Welcome back. Good luck.  Thank you.  Applause  So I grew up in Limpopo  on the border of Limpopo and Mpumalanga  a little town called Motetema. Water and electricity supply are as unpredictable as the weather  and growing up in these tough situations  at the age of     I was relaxing with a couple of friends of mine in winter  and we were sunbathing. The Limpopo sun gets really hot in winter. So as we were sunbathing  my best friend next to me says   Man  why doesn't somebody invent something that you can just put on your skin and then you don't have to bathe   And I sat  and I was like   Man  I would buy that  eh   So I went home  and I did a little research  and I found some very shocking statistics. Over  .  billion people in the world today do not have proper access to water and sanitation. Four hundred and fifty million of them are in Africa  and five million of them are in South Africa. Various diseases thrive in this environment  the most drastic of which is called trachoma. Trachoma is an infection of the eye due to dirt getting into your eye. Multiple infections of trachoma can leave you permanently blind. The disease leaves eight million people permanently blind each and every year. The shocking part about it is that to avoid being infected with trachoma  all you have to do is wash your face  no medicine  no pills  no injections. So after seeing these shocking statistics  I thought to myself   Okay  even if I'm not just doing it for myself and the fact that I don't want to bathe  I at least need to do it to try to save the world.   Laughter  So with my trusty little steed  my Nokia      cell phone    I didn't have a laptop  I didn't have Internet much  except for the    rand an hour Internet cafe   I did research on Wikipedia  on Google  about lotions  creams  the compositions  the melting points  the toxicities    I did high school science    and I wrote down a little formula on a piece of paper  and it looked like the KFC special spice  you know  So I was like  okay  so we've got the formula ready. Now we need to get this thing into practice. Fast forward four years later  after having written a    page business plan on the cell phone  having written my patent on the cell phone  I'm the youngest patent holder in the country  and     No more bathing      I can't say any more than that.  Laughter  I had invented DryBath  the world's first bath substituting lotion. You literally put it on your skin  and you don't have to bathe. So after having tried to make it work in high school with the limited resources I had  I went to university  met a few people  got it into practice  and we have a fully functioning product that's ready to go to the market. It's actually available on the market. So we learned a few lessons in commercializing and making DryBath available. One of the things we learned was that poor communities don't buy products in bulk. They buy products on demand. A person in Alex doesn't buy a box of cigarettes. They buy one cigarette each day  even though it's more expensive. So we packaged DryBath in these innovative little sachets. You just snap them in half  and you squeeze it out. And the cool part is  one sachet substitutes one bath for five rand. After creating that model  we also learned a lot in terms of implementing the product. We realized that even rich kids from the suburbs really want DryBath.  Laughter  At least once a week. Anyway  we realized that we could save    million liters of water on average each time they skipped a bath  and also we would save two hours a day for kids who are in rural areas  two hours more for school  two hours more for homework  two hours more to just be a kid. After seeing that global impact  we narrowed it down to our key value proposition  which was cleanliness and convenience. DryBath is a rich man's convenience and a poor man's lifesaver. Having put the product into practice  we are actually now on the verge of selling the product onto a multinational to take it to the retail market  and one question I have for the audience today is  on the gravel roads of Limpopo  with an allowance of    rand a week  I came up with a way for the world not to bathe. What's stopping you   Applause  I'm not done yet. I'm not done yet. And another key thing that I learned a lot throughout this whole process  last year Google named me as one of the brightest young minds in the world. I'm also currently the best student entrepreneur in the world  the first African to get that accolade  and one thing that really puzzles me is  I did all of this just because I didn't want to bathe. Thank you. B.J. was one of many fellow inmates who had big plans for the future. He had a vision. When he got out  he was going to leave the dope game for good and fly straight  and he was actually working on merging his two passions into one vision. He'd spent        dollars to buy a website that exclusively featured women having sex on top of or inside of luxury sports cars.  Laughter  It was my first week in federal prison  and I was learning quickly that it wasn't what you see on TV. In fact  it was teeming with smart  ambitious men whose business instincts were in many cases as sharp as those of the CEOs who had wined and dined me six months earlier when I was a rising star in the Missouri Senate. Now     percent of the guys that I was locked up with had been drug dealers on the outside  but when they talked about what they did  they talked about it in a different jargon  but the business concepts that they talked about weren't unlike those that you'd learn in a first year MBA class at Wharton  promotional incentives  you never charge a first time user  focus grouping new product launches  territorial expansion. But they didn't spend a lot of time reliving the glory days. For the most part  everyone was just trying to survive. It's a lot harder than you might think. Contrary to what most people think  people don't pay  taxpayers don't pay  for your life when you're in prison. You've got to pay for your own life. You've got to pay for your soap  your deodorant  toothbrush  toothpaste  all of it. And it's hard for a couple of reasons. First  everything's marked up    to    percent from what you'd pay on the street  and second  you don't make a lot of money. I unloaded trucks. That was my full time job  unloading trucks at a food warehouse  for   .    not an hour  but per month. So how do you survive  Well  you learn to hustle  all kinds of hustles. There's legal hustles. You pay everything in stamps. Those are the currency. You charge another inmate to clean his cell. There's sort of illegal hustles  like you run a barbershop out of your cell. There's pretty illegal hustles  You run a tattoo parlor out of your own cell. And there's very illegal hustles  which you smuggle in  you get smuggled in  drugs  pornography  cell phones  and just as in the outer world  there's a risk reward tradeoff  so the riskier the enterprise  the more profitable it can potentially be. You want a cigarette in prison  Three to five dollars. You want an old fashioned cell phone that you flip open and is about as big as your head  Three hundred bucks. You want a dirty magazine  Well  it can be as much as       dollars. So as you can probably tell  one of the defining aspects of prison life is ingenuity. Whether it was concocting delicious meals from stolen scraps from the warehouse  sculpting people's hair with toenail clippers  or constructing weights from boulders in laundry bags tied on to tree limbs  prisoners learn how to make do with less  and many of them want to take this ingenuity that they've learned to the outside and start restaurants  barber shops  personal training businesses. But there's no training  nothing to prepare them for that  no rehabilitation at all in prison  no one to help them write a business plan  figure out a way to translate the business concepts they intuitively grasp into legal enterprises  no access to the Internet  even. And then  when they come out  most states don't even have a law prohibiting employers from discriminating against people with a background. So none of us should be surprised that two out of three ex offenders re offend within five years. Look  I lied to the Feds. I lost a year of my life from it. But when I came out  I vowed that I was going to do whatever I could to make sure that guys like the ones I was locked up with didn't have to waste any more of their life than they already had. So I hope that you'll think about helping in some way. The best thing we can do is figure out ways to nurture the entrepreneurial spirit and the tremendous untapped potential in our prisons  because if we don't  they're not going to learn any new skills that's going to help them  and they'll be right back. All they'll learn on the inside is new hustles. Thank you.  Applause  I'd like to show you a video of some of the models I work with. They're all the perfect size  and they don't have an ounce of fat. Did I mention they're gorgeous  And they're scientific models   Laughs  As you might have guessed  I'm a tissue engineer  and this is a video of some of the beating heart that I've engineered in the lab. And one day we hope that these tissues can serve as replacement parts for the human body. But what I'm going to tell you about today is how these tissues make awesome models. Well  let's think about the drug screening process for a moment. You go from drug formulation  lab testing  animal testing  and then clinical trials  which you might call human testing  before the drugs get to market. It costs a lot of money  a lot of time  and sometimes  even when a drug hits the market  it acts in an unpredictable way and actually hurts people. And the later it fails  the worse the consequences. It all boils down to two issues. One  humans are not rats  and two  despite our incredible similarities to one another  actually those tiny differences between you and I have huge impacts with how we metabolize drugs and how those drugs affect us. So what if we had better models in the lab that could not only mimic us better than rats but also reflect our diversity  Let's see how we can do it with tissue engineering. One of the key technologies that's really important is what's called induced pluripotent stem cells. They were developed in Japan pretty recently. Okay  induced pluripotent stem cells. They're a lot like embryonic stem cells except without the controversy. We induce cells  okay  say  skin cells  by adding a few genes to them  culturing them  and then harvesting them. So they're skin cells that can be tricked  kind of like cellular amnesia  into an embryonic state. So without the controversy  that's cool thing number one. Cool thing number two  you can grow any type of tissue out of them  brain  heart  liver  you get the picture  but out of your cells. So we can make a model of your heart  your brain on a chip. Generating tissues of predictable density and behavior is the second piece  and will be really key towards getting these models to be adopted for drug discovery. And this is a schematic of a bioreactor we're developing in our lab to help engineer tissues in a more modular  scalable way. Going forward  imagine a massively parallel version of this with thousands of pieces of human tissue. It would be like having a clinical trial on a chip. But another thing about these induced pluripotent stem cells is that if we take some skin cells  let's say  from people with a genetic disease and we engineer tissues out of them  we can actually use tissue engineering techniques to generate models of those diseases in the lab. Here's an example from Kevin Eggan's lab at Harvard. He generated neurons from these induced pluripotent stem cells from patients who have Lou Gehrig's Disease  and he differentiated them into neurons  and what's amazing is that these neurons also show symptoms of the disease. So with disease models like these  we can fight back faster than ever before and understand the disease better than ever before  and maybe discover drugs even faster. This is another example of patient specific stem cells that were engineered from someone with retinitis pigmentosa. This is a degeneration of the retina. It's a disease that runs in my family  and we really hope that cells like these will help us find a cure. So some people think that these models sound well and good  but ask   Well  are these really as good as the rat   The rat is an entire organism  after all  with interacting networks of organs. A drug for the heart can get metabolized in the liver  and some of the byproducts may be stored in the fat. Don't you miss all that with these tissue engineered models  Well  this is another trend in the field. By combining tissue engineering techniques with microfluidics  the field is actually evolving towards just that  a model of the entire ecosystem of the body  complete with multiple organ systems to be able to test how a drug you might take for your blood pressure might affect your liver or an antidepressant might affect your heart. These systems are really hard to build  but we're just starting to be able to get there  and so  watch out. But that's not even all of it  because once a drug is approved  tissue engineering techniques can actually help us develop more personalized treatments. This is an example that you might care about someday  and I hope you never do  because imagine if you ever get that call that gives you that bad news that you might have cancer. Wouldn't you rather test to see if those cancer drugs you're going to take are going to work on your cancer  This is an example from Karen Burg's lab  where they're using inkjet technologies to print breast cancer cells and study its progressions and treatments. And some of our colleagues at Tufts are mixing models like these with tissue engineered bone to see how cancer might spread from one part of the body to the next  and you can imagine those kinds of multi tissue chips to be the next generation of these kinds of studies. And so thinking about the models that we've just discussed  you can see  going forward  that tissue engineering is actually poised to help revolutionize drug screening at every single step of the path  disease models making for better drug formulations  massively parallel human tissue models helping to revolutionize lab testing  reduce animal testing and human testing in clinical trials  and individualized therapies that disrupt what we even consider to be a market at all. Essentially  we're dramatically speeding up that feedback between developing a molecule and learning about how it acts in the human body. Our process for doing this is essentially transforming biotechnology and pharmacology into an information technology  helping us discover and evaluate drugs faster  more cheaply and more effectively. It gives new meaning to models against animal testing  doesn't it  Thank you.  Applause   My Air Jordans cost a hundred with tax. My suede Starters jacket says Raiders on the back. I'm stylin'  smilin'  lookin' real mean  because it ain't about being heard  just being seen. My leather Adidas baseball cap matches my fake Gucci backpack.  Laughter  Ain't nobody who looks as good as me  but this costs money  it sure ain't free  and I gots no job  no money at all  but it's easy to steal all this from the mall. Parents say I shouldn't  but I knows I should. Got to do what I can to make sure I look good  and the reason I have to look real good  well  to tell you the truth  man  I don't know why. Guess it makes me feel special inside. When I'm wearing fresh gear I don't have to hide  and I really must get some new gear soon or my ego will pop like a    cent balloon. But security is tight at all the shops. Every day there are more and more cops. My crew is laughing at me because I'm wearing old gear. School's almost over. Summer is near. And I'm sportin' torn Jordans. I need something new. Only one thing left to do. Cut school Friday  catch the subway downtown  check out my victims hangin' around. Maybe I'll get lucky and find easy prey. Got to get some new gear. There's no other way. I'm ready and willing. I'm packing my gun. This is serious business. This ain't no fun. And I can't have my posse laughin' at me. I'mma cop something dope  just wait  you'll see. Come out of the station  West  th near the park  brothers shooting hoops and someone remarks  'Hey homes  where you get them Nik's ' I says to myself  'Yeah. I likes 'em  I likes.' They were Q tip white  bright and blinding my eyes. The red emblem of Michael looked as if it could fly. Not one spot of dirt. The Airs were brand new. Had my pistol and knew just what to do. Waited until it was just the right time  followed him very closely behind. He made a left turn on Houston  I pulled out my gun  and I said  'Gimme them Jordans ' And the punk tried to run. Took off fast  didn't get far. I fired 'Pow ' Fool fell between two parked cars. He was coughing  crying  blood spilled on the street. And I snatched them Air Jordans off of his feet. While laying there dying  all he could say was   Please man  don't take my Air Jordans away.  You'd think he'd be worried about staying alive. As I took off with his sneakers  there was tears in his eyes. Very next day  I bopped into school with my brand new Air Jordans  man  I was cool. I killed to get 'em  but hey  I don't care  because now I needs a new jacket to wear.  Thank you.  Applause  For the last    years that I have been performing  all I ever wanted to do was transcend poetry to the world. See  it wasn't enough for me to write a book. It wasn't enough for me to join a slam competition  and while those things hold weight  it wasn't the driving force that pushes the pen to the pad. The hunger and thirst was  and still remains  How do I get people who hate poetry to love me  Because I'm an extension of my work  and if they love me  then they will love my work  and if they love my work  then they will love poetry  and if they love poetry  then I will have done my job  which is to transcend it to the world. And in       I found the answer in principles in a master spoken word artist named Reg E. Gaines  who wrote the famous poem   Please Don't Take My Air Jordans.  And I followed this guy everywhere until I had him in the room  and I read him one of my pieces  and you know what he told me   Yo' wack. You know what the problem is with you  homie  You don't read other people's poetry  and you don't got any subordination for verbal measures to tonal consideration.   Laughter  Now he kept on rambling about poetry and styles and Nuyorican Friday nights. Now I could have quit. I should have quit. I mean  I thought poetry was just self expression. I didn't know you actually have to have creative control. So instead of quitting  I followed him everywhere. When he was writing a Broadway show  I would be outside of the door. I would wake him up at  like       in the morning to ask him who's the best poet. I remember eating the eyes of a fish right out of the sea because he told me it was brain food. Then one day I told him   Reg E.  what is subordination for verbal measures to tonal consideration    Laughter  And he handed me a black and white printed out thesis on a poet named Etheridge Knight and the oral nature of poetry  and from that point  Reggie stopped becoming the best to me  because what Etheridge Knight taught me was that I could make my words sound like music  even my small ones  the monosyllables  the ifs  ands  buts  whats  the gangsta in my slang could fall right on the ear  and from then on  I started chasing Etheridge Knight. I wanted to know which poet he read  and I landed on a poem called   Dark Prophecy  Sing of Shine    a toast signifying that got me on the biggest stage a poet could ever be  Broadway  baby. And from that point  I learned how to pull the mic away and attack the poetry with my body. But that wasn't the biggest lesson I ever learned. The biggest lesson I learned was many years later when I went to Beverly Hills and I ran into a talent agent who looked at me up and down and said I don't look like I have any experience to be working in this business. And I said to him   Listen  punk fool  you're a failed actor who became an agent  and you know why you failed as an actor  Because people like me took your job. I've traveled all the way from Cleveland and Essex in East New York  took the local   line up to the hookers of Hunt's Point who were in my way on my way to master the art of space  and the one to infinite amount of man  woman and child you can fit in there only so I can push them to the back of the wall with my experience. People have bought tickets to my experience and used them as refrigerator magnets to let them know that the revolution is near  so stock up. I'm so experienced that when you went to a privileged school to learn a Shakespearean sonnet  I was getting those beats kicked and shoved into me. I can master shock of  The Crying Game  with the awe of a child being called an AIDS victim by a bully who didn't know that it was his father who gave it to my mother  and that's a double entendre. I'm so experienced that when you went to the Fell School and all the rich little fairy boys decided to sponsor a child in it  that was me  but kicked me out when I was caught teaching the fairy boys how to rob the PATS off a pair of Lee Jeans and bring them to VIM. Let me see Chekhov pull that off. Sanford Meisner was my Uncle Artie yelling silently to himself   Something's always wrong when nothing's always right.  Method acting is nothing but a mixture of multiple personalities  believing your own lies are reality  like in high school cool Kenny telling me he wanted to be a cop. Dude  you go to Riker's Island Academy. I could make David Mamet psychoanalyze my attack on dialogue  Stanislavski be as if he were Bruce Lee kicking your roster of talentless students up and down Crenshaw. So what  your actors studied guerrilla theater at the London Rep  Let me tell you an ancient Chinese Saturday afternoon kung fu secret. Boards don't hit back. You think black entertainers have it hard finding work in this business  I'm a suspicious mulatto  which means I'm too black to be white and too white to be doing it right. Forget the American ghetto. I've cracked stages in Soweto  buried abortion babies in potter's field and still managed to keep a smile on my face  so whatever you curse at me to your caddyshack go for this  go for that assistant when I walk out that door  whatever slander you send my way  your mother. Thank you.  Applause  In       a group of treatment activists met to discuss the early development of the airplane. The Wright Brothers  in the beginning of the last century  had for the first time managed to make one of those devices fly. They also had taken out numerous patents on essential parts of the airplane. They were not the only ones. That was common practice in the industry  and those who held patents on airplanes were defending them fiercely and suing competitors left and right. This actually wasn't so great for the development of the aviation industry  and this was at a time that in particular the U.S. government was interested in ramping up the production of military airplanes. So there was a bit of a conflict there. The U.S. government decided to take action  and forced those patent holders to make their patents available to share with others to enable the production of airplanes. So what has this got to do with this  In       Nelson Otwoma  a Kenyan social scientist  discovered he had HIV and needed access to treatment. He was told that a cure did not exist. AIDS  he heard  was lethal  and treatment was not offered. This was at a time that treatment actually existed in rich countries. AIDS had become a chronic disease. People in our countries here in Europe  in North America  were living with HIV  healthy lives. Not so for Nelson. He wasn't rich enough  and not so for his three year old son  who he discovered a year later also had HIV. Nelson decided to become a treatment activist and join up with other groups. In       they were facing a different battle. Prices for ARVs  the drugs needed to treat HIV  cost about         dollars  per patient per year. The patents on those drugs were held by a number of Western pharmaceutical companies that were not necessarily willing to make those patents available. When you have a patent  you can exclude anyone else from making  from producing or making low cost versions  for example  available of those medications. Clearly this led to patent wars breaking out all over the globe. Luckily  those patents did not exist everywhere. There were countries that did not recognize pharmaceutical product patents  such as India  and Indian pharmaceutical companies started to produce so called generic versions  low cost copies of antiretroviral medicines  and make them available in the developing world  and within a year the price had come down from        dollars per patient per year to     dollars per patient per year  and today that same triple pill cocktail is available for    dollars per patient per year  and of course that started to have an enormous effect on the number of people who could afford access to those medicines. Treatment programs became possible  funding became available  and the number of people on antiretroviral drugs started to increase very rapidly. Today  eight million people have access to antiretroviral drugs. Thirty four million are infected with HIV. Never has this number been so high  but actually this is good news  because what it means is people stop dying. People who have access to these drugs stop dying. And there's something else. They also stop passing on the virus. This is fairly recent science that has shown that. What that means is we have the tools to break the back of this epidemic. So what's the problem  Well  things have changed. First of all  the rules have changed. Today  all countries are obliged to provide patents for pharmaceuticals that last at least    years. This is as a result of the intellectual property rules of the World Trade Organization. So what India did is no longer possible. Second  the practice of patent holding companies have changed. Here you see the patent practices before the World Trade Organization's rules  before '    before antiretroviral drugs. This is what you see today  and this is in developing countries  so what that means is  unless we do something deliberate and unless we do something now  we will very soon be faced with another drug price crisis  because new drugs are developed  new drugs go to market  but these medicines are patented in a much wider range of countries. So unless we act  unless we do something today  we will soon be faced  with  what some have termed the treatment time bomb. It isn't only the number of drugs that are patented. There's something else that can really scare generic manufacturers away. This shows you a patent landscape. This is the landscape of one medicine. So you can imagine that if you are a generic company about to decide whether to invest in the development of this product  unless you know that the licenses to these patents are actually going to be available  you will probably choose to do something else. Again  deliberate action is needed. So surely if a patent pool could be established to ramp up the production of military airplanes  we should be able to do something similar to tackle the HIV AIDS epidemic. And we did. In       UNITAID established the Medicines Patent Pool for HIV. And this is how it works  Patent holders  inventors that develop new medicines patent those inventions  but make those patents available to the Medicines Patent Pool. The Medicines Patent Pool then license those out to whoever needs access to those patents. That can be generic manufacturers. It can also be not for profit drug development agencies  for example. Those manufacturers can then sell those medicines at much lower cost to people who need access to them  to treatment programs that need access to them. They pay royalties over the sales to the patent holders  so they are remunerated for sharing their intellectual property. There is one key difference with the airplane patent pool. The Medicines Patent Pool is a voluntary mechanism. The airplane patent holders were not left a choice whether they'd license their patents or not. They were forced to do so. That is something that the Medicines Patent Pool cannot do. It relies on the willingness of pharmaceutical companies to license their patents and make them available for others to use. Today  Nelson Otwoma is healthy. He has access to antiretroviral drugs. His son will soon be    years old. Nelson is a member of the expert advisory group of the Medicines Patent Pool  and he told me not so long ago   Ellen  we rely in Kenya and in many other countries on the Medicines Patent Pool to make sure that new medicines also become available to us  that new medicines  without delay  become available to us.  And this is no longer fantasy. Already  I'll give you an example. In August of this year  the United States drug agency approved a new four in one AIDS medication. The company  Gilead  that holds the patents  has licensed the intellectual property to the Medicines Patent Pool. The pool is already working today  two months later  with generic manufacturers to make sure that this product can go to market at low cost where and when it is needed. This is unprecedented. This has never been done before. The rule is about a    year delay for a new product to go to market in developing countries  if at all. This has never been seen before. Nelson's expectations are very high  and quite rightly so. He and his son will need access to the next generation of antiretrovirals and the next  throughout their lifetime  so that he and many others in Kenya and other countries can continue to live healthy  active lives. Now we count on the willingness of drug companies to make that happen. We count on those companies that understand that it is in the interest  not only in the interest of the global good  but also in their own interest  to move from conflict to collaboration  and through the Medicines Patent Pool they can make that happen. They can also choose not to do that  but those that go down that road may end up in a similar situation the Wright brothers ended up with early last century  facing forcible measures by government. So they'd better jump now. Thank you.  Applause  I've been a journalist now since I was about     and it's an interesting industry to be in at the moment  because as you all know  there's a huge amount of upheaval going on in media  and most of you probably know this from the business angle  which is that the business model is pretty screwed  and as my grandfather would say  the profits have all been gobbled up by Google. So it's a really interesting time to be a journalist  but the upheaval that I'm interested in is not on the output side. It's on the input side. It's concern with how we get information and how we gather the news. And that's changed  because we've had a huge shift in the balance of power from the news organizations to the audience. And the audience for such a long time was in a position where they didn't have any way of affecting news or making any change. They couldn't really connect. And that's changed irrevocably. My first connection with the news media was in       the BBC had a one day strike. I wasn't happy. I was angry. I couldn't see my cartoons. So I wrote a letter. And it's a very effective way of ending your hate mail   Love Markham  Aged  .  Still works. I'm not sure if I had any impact on the one day strike  but what I do know is that it took them three weeks to get back to me. And that was the round journey. It took that long for anyone to have any impact and get some feedback. And that's changed now because  as journalists  we interact in real time. We're not in a position where the audience is reacting to news. We're reacting to the audience  and we're actually relying on them. They're helping us find the news. They're helping us figure out what is the best angle to take and what is the stuff that they want to hear. So it's a real time thing. It's much quicker. It's happening on a constant basis  and the journalist is always playing catch up. To give an example of how we rely on the audience  on the  th of September in Costa Rica  an earthquake hit. It was a  .  magnitude. It was fairly big. And    seconds is the amount of time it took for it to travel     kilometers to Managua. So the ground shook in Managua    seconds after it hit the epicenter. Thirty seconds later  the first message went onto Twitter  and this was someone saying  temblor   which means earthquake. So    seconds was how long it took for the physical earthquake to travel. Thirty seconds later news of that earthquake had traveled all around the world  instantly. Everyone in the world  hypothetically  had the potential to know that an earthquake was happening in Managua. And that happened because this one person had a documentary instinct  which was to post a status update  which is what we all do now  so if something happens  we put our status update  or we post a photo  we post a video  and it all goes up into the cloud in a constant stream. And what that means is just constant  huge volumes of data going up. It's actually staggering. When you look at the numbers  every minute there are    more hours of video on YouTube. So that's  every second  more than an hour of video gets uploaded. And in photos  Instagram     photos are uploaded to Instagram a second. More than three and a half thousand photos go up onto Facebook. So by the time I'm finished talking here  there'll be     more hours of video on Youtube than there were when I started  and two and a half million more photos on Facebook and Instagram than when I started. So it's an interesting position to be in as a journalist  because we should have access to everything. Any event that happens anywhere in the world  I should be able to know about it pretty much instantaneously  as it happens  for free. And that goes for every single person in this room. The only problem is  when you have that much information  you have to find the good stuff  and that can be incredibly difficult when you're dealing with those volumes. And nowhere was this brought home more than during Hurricane Sandy. So what you had in Hurricane Sandy was a superstorm  the likes of which we hadn't seen for a long time  hitting the iPhone capital of the universe     Laughter     and you got volumes of media like we'd never seen before. And that meant that journalists had to deal with fakes  so we had to deal with old photos that were being reposted. We had to deal with composite images that were merging photos from previous storms. We had to deal with images from films like  The Day After Tomorrow.   Laughter  And we had to deal with images that were so realistic it was nearly difficult to tell if they were real at all. But joking aside  there were images like this one from Instagram which was subjected to a grilling by journalists. They weren't really sure. It was filtered in Instagram. The lighting was questioned. Everything was questioned about it. And it turned out to be true. It was from Avenue C in downtown Manhattan  which was flooded. And the reason that they could tell that it was real was because they could get to the source  and in this case  these guys were New York food bloggers. They were well respected. They were known. So this one wasn't a debunk  it was actually something that they could prove. And that was the job of the journalist. It was filtering all this stuff. And you were  instead of going and finding the information and bringing it back to the reader  you were holding back the stuff that was potentially damaging. And finding the source becomes more and more important    finding the good source    and Twitter is where most journalists now go. It's like the de facto real time newswire  if you know how to use it  because there is so much on Twitter. And a good example of how useful it can be but also how difficult was the Egyptian revolution in     . As a non Arabic speaker  as someone who was looking from the outside  from Dublin  Twitter lists  and lists of good sources  people we could establish were credible  were really important. And how do you build a list like that from scratch  Well  it can be quite difficult  but you have to know what to look for. This visualization was done by an Italian academic. He's called Andr  Pannison  and he basically took the Twitter conversation in Tahrir Square on the day that Hosni Mubarak would eventually resign  and the dots you can see are retweets  so when someone retweets a message  a connection is made between two dots  and the more times that message is retweeted by other people  the more you get to see these nodes  these connections being made. And it's an amazing way of visualizing the conversation  but what you get is hints at who is more interesting and who is worth investigating. And as the conversation grew and grew  it became more and more lively  and eventually you were left with this huge  big  rhythmic pointer of this conversation. You could find the nodes  though  and then you went  and you go   Right  I've got to investigate these people. These are the ones that are obviously making sense. Let's see who they are.  Now in the deluge of information  this is where the real time web gets really interesting for a journalist like myself  because we have more tools than ever to do that kind of investigation. And when you start digging into the sources  you can go further and further than you ever could before. Sometimes you come across a piece of content that is so compelling  you want to use it  you're dying to use it  but you're not     percent sure if you can because you don't know if the source is credible. You don't know if it's a scrape. You don't know if it's a re upload. And you have to do that investigative work. And this video  which I'm going to let run through  was one we discovered a couple of weeks ago. Video  Getting real windy in just a second. Markham Nolan  Okay  so now if you're a news producer  this is something you'd love to run with  because obviously  this is gold. You know  This is a fantastic reaction from someone  very genuine video that they've shot in their back garden. But how do you find if this person  if it's true  if it's faked  or if it's something that's old and that's been reposted  So we set about going to work on this video  and the only thing that we had to go on was the username on the YouTube account. There was only one video posted to that account  and the username was Rita Krill. And we didn't know if Rita existed or if it was a fake name. But we started looking  and we used free Internet tools to do so. The first one was called Spokeo  which allowed us to look for Rita Krills. So we looked all over the U.S. We found them in New York  we found them in Pennsylvania  Nevada and Florida. So we went and we looked for a second free Internet tool called Wolfram Alpha  and we checked the weather reports for the day in which this video had been uploaded  and when we went through all those various cities  we found that in Florida  there were thunderstorms and rain on the day. So we went to the white pages  and we found  we looked through the Rita Krills in the phonebook  and we looked through a couple of different addresses  and that took us to Google Maps  where we found a house. And we found a house with a swimming pool that looked remarkably like Rita's. So we went back to the video  and we had to look for clues that we could cross reference. So if you look in the video  there's the big umbrella  there's a white lilo in the pool  there are some unusually rounded edges in the swimming pool  and there's two trees in the background. And we went back to Google Maps  and we looked a little bit closer  and sure enough  there's the white lilo  there are the two trees  there's the umbrella. It's actually folded in this photo. Little bit of trickery. And there are the rounded edges on the swimming pool. So we were able to call Rita  clear the video  make sure that it had been shot  and then our clients were delighted because they were able to run it without being worried. Sometimes the search for truth  though  is a little bit less flippant  and it has much greater consequences. Syria has been really interesting for us  because obviously a lot of the time you're trying to debunk stuff that can be potentially war crime evidence  so this is where YouTube actually becomes the most important repository of information about what's going on in the world. So this video  I'm not going to show you the whole thing  because it's quite gruesome  but you'll hear some of the sounds. This is from Hama. Video   Shouting  And what this video shows  when you watch the whole thing through  is bloody bodies being taken out of a pickup truck and thrown off a bridge. The allegations were that these guys were Muslim Brotherhood and they were throwing Syrian Army officers' bodies off the bridge  and they were cursing and using blasphemous language  and there were lots of counterclaims about who they were  and whether or not they were what the video said it was. So we talked to some sources in Hama who we had been back and forth with on Twitter  and we asked them about this  and the bridge was interesting to us because it was something we could identify. Three different sources said three different things about the bridge. They said  one  the bridge doesn't exist. Another one said the bridge does exist  but it's not in Hama. It's somewhere else. And the third one said   I think the bridge does exist  but the dam upstream of the bridge was closed  so the river should actually have been dry  so this doesn't make sense.  So that was the only one that gave us a clue. We looked through the video for other clues. We saw the distinctive railings  which we could use. We looked at the curbs. The curbs were throwing shadows south  so we could tell the bridge was running east west across the river. It had black and white curbs. As we looked at the river itself  you could see there's a concrete stone on the west side. There's a cloud of blood. That's blood in the river. So the river is flowing south to north. That's what that tells me. And also  as you look away from the bridge  there's a divot on the left hand side of the bank  and the river narrows. So onto Google Maps we go  and we start looking through literally every single bridge. We go to the dam that we talked about  we start just literally going through every time that road crosses the river  crossing off the bridges that don't match. We're looking for one that crosses east west. And we get to Hama. We get all the way from the dam to Hama and there's no bridge. So we go a bit further. We switch to the satellite view  and we find another bridge  and everything starts to line up. The bridge looks like it's crossing the river east to west. So this could be our bridge. And we zoom right in. We start to see that it's got a median  so it's a two lane bridge. And it's got the black and white curbs that we saw in the video  and as we click through it  you can see someone's uploaded photos to go with the map  which is very handy  so we click into the photos. And the photos start showing us more detail that we can cross reference with the video. The first thing that we see is we see black and white curbing  which is handy because we've seen that before. We see the distinctive railing that we saw the guys throwing the bodies over. And we keep going through it until we're certain that this is our bridge. So what does that tell me  I've got to go back now to my three sources and look at what they told me  the one who said the bridge didn't exist  the one who said the bridge wasn't in Hama  and the one guy who said   Yes  the bridge does exist  but I'm not sure about the water levels.  Number three is looking like the most truthful all of a sudden  and we've been able to find that out using some free Internet tools sitting in a cubicle in an office in Dublin in the space of    minutes. And that's part of the joy of this. Although the web is running like a torrent  there's so much information there that it's incredibly hard to sift and getting harder every day  if you use them intelligently  you can find out incredible information. Given a couple of clues  I could probably find out a lot of things about most of you in the audience that you might not like me finding out. But what it tells me is that  at a time when there's more    there's a greater abundance of information than there ever has been  it's harder to filter  we have greater tools. We have free Internet tools that allow us  help us do this kind of investigation. We have algorithms that are smarter than ever before  and computers that are quicker than ever before. But here's the thing. Algorithms are rules. They're binary. They're yes or no  they're black or white. Truth is never binary. Truth is a value. Truth is emotional  it's fluid  and above all  it's human. No matter how quick we get with computers  no matter how much information we have  you'll never be able to remove the human from the truth seeking exercise  because in the end  it is a uniquely human trait. Thanks very much.  Applause  Hello  Doha. Hello  Salaam alaikum. I love coming to Doha. It's such an international place. It feels like the United Nations here. You land at the airport  and you're welcomed by an Indian lady who takes you to Al Maha Services  where you meet a Filipino lady who hands you off to a South African lady who then takes you to a Korean who takes you to a Pakistani guy with the luggage who takes you to the car with a Sri Lankan. You go to the hotel and you check in. There's a Lebanese. Yeah  And then a Swedish guy showed me my room. I said   Where are the Qataris   They said   No  no  it's too hot. They come out later. They're smart.   They know.  And of course  it's growing so fast  sometimes there's growing pains. You know  like sometimes you run into people that you think know the city well  but they don't know it that well. My Indian cab driver showed up at the W  and I asked him to take me to the Sheraton  and he said   No problem  sir.  And then we sat there for two minutes. I said   What's wrong   He said   One problem  sir.  I said   What   He goes   Where is it   I go   You're the driver  you should know.  He goes   No  I just arrived  sir.  I go   You just arrived at the W    No  I just arrived in Doha  sir.   I was on my way home from the airport  I got a job. I'm working already.  He goes   Sir  why don't you drive    I don't know where we're going.   Neither do I. It will be an adventure  sir.  The Middle East has been an adventure the past couple of years. It is going crazy with the Arab Spring and revolution and all this. Are there any Lebanese here tonight  by applause  Lebanese  yeah. The Middle East is going crazy. You know the Middle East is going crazy when Lebanon is the most peaceful place in the region. Who would have thought  Oh my gosh. No  there's serious issues in the region. Some people don't want to talk about them. I'm here to talk about them tonight. Ladies and gentlemen of the Middle East  here's a serious issue. When we see each other  when we say hello  how many kisses are we going to do  Every country is different and it's confusing  okay  In Lebanon  they do three. In Egypt  they do two. I was in Lebanon  I got used to three. I went to Egypt. I went to say hello to this one Egyptian guy  I went  one  two. I went for three    He wasn't into it. I told him  I said   No  no  I was just in Lebanon.  He goes   I don't care where you were. You just stay where you are  please.  I went to Saudi Arabia. In Saudi Arabia  they go one  two  and then they stay on the same side  three  four  five  six  seven  eight  nine                                        Next time you see a Saudi  look closely. They're just a little bit tilted.  Abdul  are you okay    I was saying hello for half an hour. I'll be all right.  Qataris  you guys do the nose to nose. Why is that  Are you too tired to go all the way around   Habibi  it's so hot. Just come here for a second. Say hello. Hello  Habibi. Just don't move. Just stay there  please. I need to rest.  Iranians  sometimes we do two  sometimes we do three. A friend of mine explained to me  before the '   revolution  it was two. After the revolution  three. So with Iranians  you can tell whose side the person is on based on the number of kisses they give you. Yeah  if you go one  two  three     I can't believe you support this regime    With your three kisses.  But no  guys  really  it is exciting to be here  and like I said  you guys are doing a lot culturally  you know  and it's amazing  and it helps change the image of the Middle East in the West. A lot of Americans don't know a lot about us  about the Middle East. I'm Iranian and American. I'm there. I know  I've traveled here. There's so much  we laugh  right  People don't know we laugh. When I did the Axis of Evil comedy tour  it came out on Comedy Central  I went online to see what people were saying. I ended up on a conservative website. One guy wrote another guy. He said   I never knew these people laughed.  Think about it. You never see us laughing in American film or television  right  Maybe like an evil laugh   Wuhahaha.   I will kill you in the name of Allah  wuhahahahaha.  But never like   Ha ha ha ha la.  We like to laugh. We like to celebrate life. And I wish more Americans would travel here. I always encourage my friends   Travel  see the Middle East  there's so much to see  so many good people.  And it's vice versa  and it helps stop problems of misunderstanding and stereotypes from happening. For example  I don't know if you heard about this  a little while ago in the US  there was a Muslim family walking down the aisle of an airplane  talking about the safest place to sit on the plane. Some passengers overheard them  somehow misconstrued that as terrorist talk  got them kicked off the plane. It was a family  a mother  father  child  talking about the seating. As a Middle Eastern male  I know there's certain things I'm not supposed to say on an airplane in the US  right  I'm not supposed to be walking down the aisle  and be like   Hi  Jack.  That's not cool. Even if I'm there with my friend named Jack  I say   Greetings  Jack. Salutations  Jack.  Never  Hi  Jack.  But now  apparently we can't even talk about the safest place to sit on an airplane. So my advice to all my Middle Eastern friends and Muslim friends and anyone who looks Middle Eastern or Muslim  so to  you know  Indians  and Latinos  everyone  if you're brown    Here's my advice to my brown friends. The next time you're on an airplane in the US  just speak your mother tongue. That way no one knows what you're saying. Life goes on. Granted  some mother tongues might sound a little threatening to the average American. If you're walking down the aisle speaking Arabic  you might freak them out    They might say   What's he talking about   The key  to my Arab brothers and sisters  is to throw in random good words to put people at ease as you're walking down the aisle. Just as you're walking down    Strawberry  Rainbow  Tutti Frutti   I think he's going to hijack the plane with some ice cream.  Thank you very much. Have a good night. Thank you  TED. This is poo  and what I want to do today is share my passion for poo with you  which might be quite difficult  but I think what you might find more fascinating is the way these small animals deal with poo. So this animal here has got a brain about the size of a grain of rice  and yet it can do things that you and I couldn't possibly entertain the idea of doing. And basically it's all evolved to handle its food source  which is dung. So the question is  where do we start this story  And it seems appropriate to start at the end  because this is a waste product that comes out of other animals  but it still contains nutrients and there are sufficient nutrients in there for dung beetles basically to make a living  and so dung beetles eat dung  and their larvae are also dung feeders. They are grown completely in a ball of dung. Within South Africa  we've got about     species of dung beetles  in Africa we've got       species of dung beetles  and in the world we have about       species of dung beetles. So  according to dung beetles  dung is pretty good. Unless you're prepared to get dung under your fingernails and root through the dung itself  you'll never see    percent of the dung beetle species  because they go directly into the dung  straight down below it  and then they shuttle back and forth between the dung at the soil surface and a nest they make underground. So the question is  how do they deal with this material  And most dung beetles actually wrap it into a package of some sort. Ten percent of the species actually make a ball  and this ball they roll away from the dung source  usually bury it at a remote place away from the dung source  and they have a very particular behavior by which they are able to roll their balls. So this is a very proud owner of a beautiful dung ball. You can see it's a male because he's got a little hair on the back of his legs there  and he's clearly very pleased about what he's sitting on there. And then he's about to become a victim of a vicious smash and grab.  Laughter  And this is a clear indication that this is a valuable resource. And so valuable resources have to be looked after and guarded in a particular way  and we think the reason they roll the balls away is because of this  because of the competition that is involved in getting hold of that dung. So this dung pat was actually    well  it was a dung pat    minutes before this photograph was taken  and we think it's the intense competition that makes the beetles so well adapted to rolling balls of dung. So what you've got to imagine here is this animal here moving across the African veld. Its head is down. It's walking backwards. It's the most bizarre way to actually transport your food in any particular direction  and at the same time it's got to deal with the heat. This is Africa. It's hot. So what I want to share with you now are some of the experiments that myself and my colleagues have used to investigate how dung beetles deal with these problems. So watch this beetle  and there's two things that I would like you to be aware of. The first is how it deals with this obstacle that we've put in its way. See  look  it does a little dance  and then it carries on in exactly the same direction that it took in the first place. A little dance  and then heads off in a particular direction. So clearly this animal knows where it's going and it knows where it wants to go  and that's a very  very important thing  because if you think about it  you're at the dung pile  you've got this great big pie that you want to get away from everybody else  and the quickest way to do it is in a straight line. So we gave them some more tasks to deal with  and what we did here is we turned the world under their feet. And watch its response. So this animal has actually had the whole world turned under its feet. It's turned by    degrees. But it doesn't flinch. It knows exactly where it wants to go  and it heads off in that particular direction. So our next question then was  how are they doing this  What are they doing  And there was a cue that was available to us. It was that every now and then they'd climb on top of the ball and they'd take a look at the world around them. And what do you think they could be looking at as they climb on top of the ball  What are the obvious cues that this animal could use to direct its movement  And the most obvious one is to look at the sky  and so we thought  now what could they be looking at in the sky  And the obvious thing to look at is the sun. So a classic experiment here  in that what we did was we moved the sun. What we're going to do now is shade the sun with a board and then move the sun with a mirror to a completely different position. And look at what the beetle does. It does a little double dance  and then it heads back in exactly the same direction it went in the first place. What happens now  So clearly they're looking at the sun. The sun is a very important cue in the sky for them. The thing is the sun is not always available to you  because at sunset it disappears below the horizon. What is happening in the sky here is that there's a great big pattern of polarized light in the sky that you and I can't see. It's the way our eyes are built. But the sun is at the horizon over here and we know that when the sun is at the horizon  say it's over on this side  there is a north south  a huge pathway across the sky of polarized light that we can't see that the beetles can see. So how do we test that  Well  that's easy. What we do is we get a great big polarization filter  pop the beetle underneath it  and the filter is at right angles to the polarization pattern of the sky. The beetle comes out from underneath the filter and it does a right hand turn  because it comes back under the sky that it was originally orientated to and then reorientates itself back to the direction it was originally going in. So obviously beetles can see polarized light. Okay  so what we've got so far is  what are beetles doing  They're rolling balls. How are they doing it  Well  they're rolling them in a straight line. How are they maintaining it in a particular straight line  Well  they're looking at celestial cues in the sky  some of which you and I can't see. But how do they pick up those celestial cues  That was what was of interest to us next. And it was this particular little behavior  the dance  that we thought was important  because look  it takes a pause every now and then  and then heads off in the direction that it wants to go in. So what are they doing when they do this dance  How far can we push them before they will reorientate themselves  And in this experiment here  what we did was we forced them into a channel  and you can see he wasn't particularly forced into this particular channel  and we gradually displaced the beetle by     degrees until this individual ends up going in exactly the opposite direction that it wanted to go in  in the first place. And let's see what his reaction is as he's headed through    degrees here  and now he's going to    when he ends up down here  he's going to be     degrees in the wrong direction. And see what his response is. He does a little dance  he turns around  and heads back in this. He knows exactly where he's going. He knows exactly what the problem is  and he knows exactly how to deal with it  and the dance is this transition behavior that allows them to reorientate themselves. So that's the dance  but after spending many years sitting in the African bush watching dung beetles on nice hot days  we noticed that there was another behavior associated with the dance behavior. Every now and then  when they climb on top of the ball  they wipe their face. And you see him do it again. Now we thought  now what could be going on here  Clearly the ground is very hot  and when the ground is hot  they dance more often  and when they do this particular dance  they wipe the bottom of their face. And we thought that it could be a thermoregulatory behavior. We thought that maybe what they're doing is trying to get off the hot soil and also spitting onto their face to cool their head down. So what we did was design a couple of arenas. one was hot  one was cold. We shaded this one. We left that one hot. And then what we did was we filmed them with a thermal camera. So what you're looking at here is a heat image of the system  and what you can see here emerging from the poo is a cool dung ball. So the truth is  if you look at the temperature over here  dung is cool.  Laughter  So all we're interested in here is comparing the temperature of the beetle against the background. So the background here is around about    degrees centigrade. The beetle itself and the ball are probably around about    to    degrees centigrade  so this is a great big ball of ice cream that this beetle is now transporting across the hot veld. It isn't climbing. It isn't dancing  because its body temperature is actually relatively low. It's about the same as yours and mine. And what's of interest here is that little brain is quite cool. But if we contrast now what happens in a hot environment  look at the temperature of the soil. It's up around    to    degrees centigrade. Watch how often the beetle dances. And look at its front legs. They're roaringly hot. So the ball leaves a little thermal shadow  and the beetle climbs on top of the ball and wipes its face  and all the time it's trying to cool itself down  we think  and avoid the hot sand that it's walking across. And what we did then was put little boots on these legs  because this was a way to test if the legs were involved in sensing the temperature of the soil. And if you look over here  with boots they climb onto the ball far less often when they had no boots on. So we described these as cool boots. It was a dental compound that we used to make these boots. And we also cooled down the dung ball  so we were able to put the ball in the fridge  gave them a nice cool dung ball  and they climbed onto that ball far less often than when they had a hot ball. So this is called stilting. It's a thermal behavior that you and I do if we cross the beach  we jump onto a towel  somebody has this towel     Sorry  I've jumped onto your towel.     and then you scuttle across onto somebody else's towel  and that way you don't burn your feet. And that's exactly what the beetles are doing here. However  there's one more story I'd like to share with you  and that's this particular species. It's from a genus called Pachysoma. There are    species in the genus  and they have a particular behavior that I think you will find interesting. This is a dung beetle. Watch what he's doing. Can you spot the difference  They don't normally go this slowly. It's in slow motion. but it's walking forwards  and it's actually taking a pellet of dry dung with it. This is a different species in the same genus but exactly the same foraging behavior. There's one more interesting aspect of this dung beetle's behavior that we found quite fascinating  and that's that it forages and provisions a nest. So watch this individual here  and what he's trying to do is set up a nest. And he doesn't like this first position  but he comes up with a second position  and about    minutes later  that nest is finished  and he heads off to forage and provision at a pile of dry dung pellets. And what I want you to notice is the outward path compared to the homeward path  and compare the two. And by and large  you'll see that the homeward path is far more direct than the outward path. On the outward path  he's always on the lookout for a new blob of dung. On the way home  he knows where home is  and he wants to go straight to it. The important thing here is that this is not a one way trip  as in most dung beetles. The trip here is repeated back and forth between a provisioning site and a nest site. And watch  you're going to see another South African crime taking place right now.  Laughter  And his neighbor steals one of his dung pellets. So what we're looking at here is a behavior called path integration. And what's taking place is that the beetle has got a home spot  it goes out on a convoluted path looking for food  and then when it finds food  it heads straight home. It knows exactly where its home is. Now there's two ways it could be doing that  and we can test that by displacing the beetle to a new position when it's at the foraging site. If it's using landmarks  it will find its home. If it is using something called path integration  it will not find its home. It will arrive at the wrong spot  and what it's doing here if it's using path integration is it's counting its steps or measuring the distance out in this direction. It knows the bearing home  and it knows it should be in that direction. If you displace it  it ends up in the wrong place. So let's see what happens when we put this beetle to the test with a similar experiment. So here's our cunning experimenter. He displaces the beetle  and now we have to see what is going to take place. What we've got is a burrow. That's where the forage was. The forage has been displaced to a new position. If he's using landmark orientation  he should be able to find the burrow  because he'll be able to recognize the landmarks around it. If he's using path integration  then it should end up in the wrong spot over here. So let's watch what happens when we put the beetle through the whole test. So there he is there. He's about to head home  and look what happens. Shame. It hasn't a clue. It starts to search for its house in the right distance away from the food  but it is clearly completely lost. So we know now that this animal uses path integration to find its way around  and the callous experimenter leads it top left and leaves it.  Laughter  So what we're looking at here are a group of animals that use a compass  and they use the sun as a compass to find their way around  and they have some sort of system for measuring that distance  and we know that these species here actually count the steps. That's what they use as an odometer  a step counting system  to find their way back home. We don't know yet what dung beetles use. So what have we learned from these animals with a brain that's the size of a grain of rice  Well  we know that they can roll balls in a straight line using celestial cues. We know that the dance behavior is an orientation behavior and it's also a thermoregulation behavior  and we also know that they use a path integration system for finding their way home. So for a small animal dealing with a fairly revolting substance we can actually learn an awful lot from these things doing behaviors that you and I couldn't possibly do. Thank you.  Applause  I essentially drag sledges for a living  so it doesn't take an awful lot to flummox me intellectually  but I'm going to read this question from an interview earlier this year   Philosophically  does the constant supply of information steal our ability to imagine or replace our dreams of achieving  After all  if it is being done somewhere by someone  and we can participate virtually  then why bother leaving the house   I'm usually introduced as a polar explorer. I'm not sure that's the most progressive or   st century of job titles  but I've spent more than two percent now of my entire life living in a tent inside the Arctic Circle  so I get out of the house a fair bit. And in my nature  I guess  I am a doer of things more than I am a spectator or a contemplator of things  and it's that dichotomy  the gulf between ideas and action that I'm going to try and explore briefly. The pithiest answer to the question  why   that's been dogging me for the last    years was credited certainly to this chap  the rakish looking gentleman standing at the back  second from the left  George Lee Mallory. Many of you will know his name. In      he was last seen disappearing into the clouds near the summit of Mt. Everest. He may or may not have been the first person to climb Everest  more than    years before Edmund Hillary. No one knows if he got to the top. It's still a mystery. But he was credited with coining the phrase   Because it's there.  Now I'm not actually sure that he did say that. There's very little evidence to suggest it  but what he did say is actually far nicer  and again  I've printed this. I'm going to read it out.  The first question which you will ask and which I must try to answer is this  What is the use of climbing Mt. Everest  And my answer must at once be  it is no use. There is not the slightest prospect of any gain whatsoever. Oh  we may learn a little about the behavior of the human body at high altitudes  and possibly medical men may turn our observation to some account for the purposes of aviation  but otherwise nothing will come of it. We shall not bring back a single bit of gold or silver  and not a gem  nor any coal or iron. We shall not find a single foot of earth that can be planted with crops to raise food. So it is no use. If you cannot understand that there is something in man which responds to the challenge of this mountain and goes out to meet it  that the struggle is the struggle of life itself upward and forever upward  then you won't see why we go. What we get from this adventure is just sheer joy  and joy  after all  is the end of life. We don't live to eat and make money. We eat and make money to be able to enjoy life. That is what life means  and that is what life is for.  Mallory's argument that leaving the house  embarking on these grand adventures is joyful and fun  however  doesn't tally that neatly with my own experience. The furthest I've ever got away from my front door was in the spring of     . I still don't know exactly what came over me  but my plan was to make a solo and unsupported crossing of the Arctic Ocean. I planned essentially to walk from the north coast of Russia to the North Pole  and then to carry on to the north coast of Canada. No one had ever done this. I was    at the time. A lot of experts were saying it was impossible  and my mum certainly wasn't very keen on the idea. The journey from a small weather station on the north coast of Siberia up to my final starting point  the edge of the pack ice  the coast of the Arctic Ocean  took about five hours  and if anyone watched fearless Felix Baumgartner going up  rather than just coming down  you'll appreciate the sense of apprehension  as I sat in a helicopter thundering north  and the sense  I think if anything  of impending doom. I sat there wondering what on Earth I had gotten myself into. There was a bit of fun  a bit of joy. I was   . I remember sitting there looking down at my sledge. I had my skis ready to go  I had a satellite phone  a pump action shotgun in case I was attacked by a polar bear. I remember looking out of the window and seeing the second helicopter. We were both thundering through this incredible Siberian dawn  and part of me felt a bit like a cross between Jason Bourne and Wilfred Thesiger. Part of me felt quite proud of myself  but mostly I was just utterly terrified. And that journey lasted    weeks     days. I didn't see anyone else. We took this photo next to the helicopter. Beyond that  I didn't see anyone for    weeks. The North Pole is slap bang in the middle of the sea  so I'm traveling over the frozen surface of the Arctic Ocean. NASA described conditions that year as the worst since records began. I was dragging     kilos of food and fuel and supplies  about     pounds. The average temperature for the    weeks was minus   . Minus    was the coldest. So again  there wasn't an awful lot of joy or fun to be had. One of the magical things about this journey  however  is that because I'm walking over the sea  over this floating  drifting  shifting crust of ice that's floating on top of the Arctic Ocean is it's an environment that's in a constant state of flux. The ice is always moving  breaking up  drifting around  refreezing  so the scenery that I saw for nearly   months was unique to me. No one else will ever  could ever  possibly see the views  the vistas  that I saw for    weeks. And that  I guess  is probably the finest argument for leaving the house. I can try to tell you what it was like  but you'll never know what it was like  and the more I try to explain that I felt lonely  I was the only human being in  .  million square miles  it was cold  nearly minus    with windchill on a bad day  the more words fall short  and I'm unable to do it justice. And it seems to me  therefore  that the doing  you know  to try to experience  to engage  to endeavor  rather than to watch and to wonder  that's where the real meat of life is to be found  the juice that we can suck out of our hours and days. And I would add a cautionary note here  however. In my experience  there is something addictive about tasting life at the very edge of what's humanly possible. Now I don't just mean in the field of daft macho Edwardian style derring do  but also in the fields of pancreatic cancer  there is something addictive about this  and in my case  I think polar expeditions are perhaps not that far removed from having a crack habit. I can't explain quite how good it is until you've tried it  but it has the capacity to burn up all the money I can get my hands on  to ruin every relationship I've ever had  so be careful what you wish for. Mallory postulated that there is something in man that responds to the challenge of the mountain  and I wonder if that's the case whether there's something in the challenge itself  in the endeavor  and particularly in the big  unfinished  chunky challenges that face humanity that call out to us  and in my experience that's certainly the case. There is one unfinished challenge that's been calling out to me for most of my adult life. Many of you will know the story. This is a photo of Captain Scott and his team. Scott set out just over a hundred years ago to try to become the first person to reach the South Pole. No one knew what was there. It was utterly unmapped at the time. We knew more about the surface of the moon than we did about the heart of Antarctica. Scott  as many of you will know  was beaten to it by Roald Amundsen and his Norwegian team  who used dogs and dogsleds. Scott's team were on foot  all five of them wearing harnesses and dragging around sledges  and they arrived at the pole to find the Norwegian flag already there  I'd imagine pretty bitter and demoralized. All five of them turned and started walking back to the coast and all five died on that return journey. There is a sort of misconception nowadays that it's all been done in the fields of exploration and adventure. When I talk about Antarctica  people often say   Hasn't  you know  that's interesting  hasn't that Blue Peter presenter just done it on a bike   Or   That's nice. You know  my grandmother's going on a cruise to Antarctica next year. You know. Is there a chance you'll see her there   But Scott's journey remains unfinished. No one has ever walked from the very coast of Antarctica to the South Pole and back again. It is  arguably  the most audacious endeavor of that Edwardian golden age of exploration  and it seemed to me high time  given everything we have figured out in the century since from scurvy to solar panels  that it was high time someone had a go at finishing the job. So that's precisely what I'm setting out to do. This time next year  in October  I'm leading a team of three. It will take us about four months to make this return journey. That's the scale. The red line is obviously halfway to the pole. We have to turn around and come back again. I'm well aware of the irony of telling you that we will be blogging and tweeting. You'll be able to live vicariously and virtually through this journey in a way that no one has ever before. And it'll also be a four month chance for me to finally come up with a pithy answer to the question   Why   And our lives today are safer and more comfortable than they have ever been. There certainly isn't much call for explorers nowadays. My career advisor at school never mentioned it as an option. If I wanted to know  for example  how many stars were in the Milky Way  how old those giant heads on Easter Island were  most of you could find that out right now without even standing up. And yet  if I've learned anything in nearly    years now of dragging heavy things around cold places  it is that true  real inspiration and growth only comes from adversity and from challenge  from stepping away from what's comfortable and familiar and stepping out into the unknown. In life  we all have tempests to ride and poles to walk to  and I think metaphorically speaking  at least  we could all benefit from getting outside the house a little more often  if only we could summon up the courage. I certainly would implore you to open the door just a little bit and take a look at what's outside. Thank you very much. Twelve years ago  I founded Zipcar. Zipcar buys cars and parks them throughout dense metropolitan areas for people to use  by the hour and by the day  instead of owning their own cars. Each Zipcar replaces    personal cars  and each driver drives about    percent less because they're now paying the full cost  all at once  in real time. But what Zipcar really did was make sharing the norm. Now  a decade later  it's really time to push the envelope a little bit  and so a couple years ago I moved to Paris with my husband and youngest child  and we launched Buzzcar a year ago. Buzzcar lets people rent out their own cars to their friends and neighbors. Instead of investing in a car  we invest in a community. We bring the power of a corporation to individuals who add their cars to the network. Some people call this peer to peer. This does express the humanity of what's going on  and the personal relationships  but that is also like saying that it's the same thing as a yard sale or a bake sale or babysitting. That's peer to peer. It's like saying yard sales are the same thing as eBay  or craft fairs are the same thing as Etsy. But what's really happening is that we've got the power of a free and open Internet  and on top of that we're putting a platform for participation  and the peers are now in partnership with the company  creating shared value on shared values  and each strengthening the other  and doing what the other can't do. I call this Peers  Inc. The incorporated side  the company  is doing things that it does really well. What does it do really well  It creates economies of scale  significant and long term resource investment  the expertise of many different kinds of people and different kinds of minds  and for individuals  consumers  it's bringing the standards  rules and recourse that we really want as consumers  and this is kind of bound up in a brand promise  and the companies are providing this on a platform for participation. Peers are giving and doing things that are incredibly expensive for companies to do. What do they bring  They bring this fabulous diversity  expensive for companies. And what does that deliver  It delivers localization and customization  specialization  and all of this aspect about social networks and how companies are yearning and eager to get inside there  It's natural for me. Me and my friends  I can connect to them easily. And it also delivers really fabulous innovation  and I'll talk about that later. So we have the peers that are providing the services and the product  and the company that's doing the stuff that companies do. The two of these are delivering the best of both worlds. Some of my favorite examples  in transportation  Carpooling.com. Ten years old  three and a half million people have joined up  and a million rides are shared every day. It's a phenomenal thing. It's the equivalent of       TGV trains  and just think  they didn't have to lay a track or buy a car. This is all happening with excess capacity. And it's not just with transportation  my love  but of course in other realms. Here's Fiverr.com. I met these founders just weeks after they had launched  and now  in two years  what would you do for five dollars  Seven hundred and fifty thousand gigs are now posted after two years  what people would do for five dollars. And not just easy things that anyone can do. This Peers  Inc. concept is in a very difficult and complex realm. TopCoder has         engineers who are delivering complex design and engineering services. When I talked to their CEO  he had this great line. He said   We have a community that owns its own company.  And then my all time favorite  Etsy. Etsy is providing goods that people make themselves and they're selling it in a marketplace. It just celebrated its seventh anniversary  and after seven years  last year it delivered     million dollars' worth of sales to all those individuals who have been making those objects. I know you guys out there who are businesspeople  are thinking   Oh my God  I want to build one of those. I see this incredible speed and scale. You mean all I have to do is build a platform and all these people are going to put their stuff on top and I sit back and roll it in   Building these platforms for participation are so nontrivial to do. I think of the difference of Google Video versus YouTube. Who would have thought that two young guys and a start up would beat out Google Video  Why  I actually have no idea why. I didn't talk to them. But I'm thinking  you know  they probably had the  share  button a little bit brighter and to the right  and so it was easier and more convenient for the two sides that are always participating on these networks. So I actually know a lot about building a peer platform now  and a Peers  Inc. company  because I've spent the last two years doing that in Paris. So let me take you back how it's so incredibly different building Buzzcar than it was building Zipcar  because now every single thing we do has these two different bodies that I have to be thinking about  the owners who are going to provide the cars and the drivers who are going to rent them. Every single decision  I have to think about what is right for both sides. There are many  many examples and I'll give you one that is not my favorite example  insurance. It took me a year and a half to get the insurance just right. Hours and hours of sitting with insurers and many companies and their thoughts about risk and how this is totally innovative  they'd never thought of it before. Way too much money  I just can't even go there  with lawyers  trying to figure out how this is different  who's responsible to whom  and the result was that we were able to provide owners protection for their own driving records and their own history. The cars are completely insured during the rental  and it gives drivers what they need  and what do they need  They need a low deductible  and    hour roadside assistance. So this was a trick to get these two sides. So now I want to take you to the moment of    When you're an entrepreneur  and you've started a new company  there's the  here's all the stuff we do beforehand  and then the service launches. What happens  So all those months of work  they come into play. Last June    we launched. It was an exciting moment. And all the owners are adding their cars. It's really exciting. All the drivers are becoming members. It's excellent. The reservations start coming in  and here  owners who were getting text messages and emails that said   Hey  Joe wants to rent your car for the weekend. You can earn    euros. Isn't that great  Yes or no   No reply. Like  a huge proportion of them couldn't be bothered after they had just started  they just signed up  to reply. So I thought   Duh  Robin  this is the difference between industrial production and peer production.  Industrial production  the whole point of industrial production is to provide a standardized  exact service model that is consistent every single time  and I'm really thankful that my smartphone is made using industrial production. And Zipcar provides a very nice  consistent service that works fabulously. But what does peer production do  Peer production is this completely different way of doing things  and you have a big quality range  and so eBay  cleverly  the first peer production  Peer  Inc. company  I'd say  they figured out early on  we need to have ratings and commentaries and all that yucky side stuff. We can flag that and we can put it to the side  and people who are buyers and consumers don't have to deal with it. So going back  this is my look of excitement and joy  because all this stuff that I'd also been hoping for actually really did happen  and what's that  That is the diversity of what's going on. You have these different fabulous owners and their different cars  different prices  different locations.  Laughter  They dress differently  and they look different  and  really  I love these photos every time I look at them. Cool guys  excited guys  and here is Selma  who    I love this driver. And after a year  we have       cars that are parked across France and       people who are members and eager to drive them. This would not be possible to do that in economic fashion for a traditional company. Back to this spectrum. So what's happening is  we had the yuck side  but we actually had this real wow side. And I can tell you two great stories. A driver was telling me that they went to rent a car to go up the coast of France and the owner gave it to them  and said   You know what  here's where the cliffs are  and here's all the beaches  and this is my best beach  and this is where the best fish restaurant is.  And the peers also become  peers and owners create relationships  and so at the last minute people can    a driver can say   Hey  you know what  I really need the car  is it available   And that person will say   Sure  my wife's at home. Go pick up the keys. Go do it.  So you can have these really nice things that can't happen  and it's a kind of  Wow   and I want to say  Wow   type of thing that's happening here  because individuals  if you're a company  what happens is you might have    people who are in charge of innovation  or     people who are in charge of innovation. What happens in Peer  Inc. companies is that you have tens and hundreds and thousands and even millions of people who are creating experiments on this model  and so out of all that influence and that effort  you are having this exceptional amount of innovation that is coming out. So one of the reasons  if we come back to why did I call it Buzzcar  I wanted to remind all of us about the power of the hive  and its incredible facility to create this platform that individuals want to participate and innovate on. And for me  when I think about our future  and all of those problems that seem incredibly large  the scale is impossible  the urgency is there  Peers  Inc. provides the speed and scale and the innovation and the creativity that is going to answer these problems. All we have to do is create a fabulous platform for participation    nontrivial. So I continue to think that transportation is the center of the hard universe. All problems come back to transportation for me. But there are all these other areas that are these profound  big problems that I know that we can work on  and people are working on them in many different sectors  but there's this really fabulous group of things with the power of this Peers  Inc. model. So over the last decade  we've been reveling in the power of the Internet and how it's empowered individuals  and for me  what Peers  Inc. does is it takes it up a notch. We're now bringing the power of the company and the corporation and supercharging individuals. So for me  it's a collaboration. Together  we can.  Applause  Thank you.

A few years ago  my colleagues and I were interested in how a brain chemical called serotonin would influence people's decisions in social situations. Specifically  we wanted to know how serotonin would affect the way people react when they're treated unfairly. So we did an experiment. We manipulated people's serotonin levels by giving them this really disgusting tasting artificial lemon flavored drink that works by taking away the raw ingredient for serotonin in the brain. This is the amino acid tryptophan. So what we found was  when tryptophan was low  people were more likely to take revenge when they're treated unfairly. That's the study we did  and here are some of the headlines that came out afterwards. And I thought the same thing myself when these came out  because our study had nothing to do with cheese or chocolate. We gave people this horrible tasting drink that affected their tryptophan levels. But it turns out that tryptophan also happens to be found in cheese and chocolate. And of course when science says cheese and chocolate help you make better decisions  well  that's sure to grab people's attention. So there you have it  the evolution of a headline. When this happened  a part of me thought  well  what's the big deal  So the media oversimplified a few things  but in the end  it's just a news story. And I think a lot of scientists have this attitude. But the problem is that this kind of thing happens all the time  and it affects not just the stories you read in the news but also the products you see on the shelves. When the headlines rolled  what happened was  the marketers came calling. Would I be willing to provide a scientific endorsement of a mood boosting bottled water  Or would I go on television to demonstrate  in front of a live audience  that comfort foods really do make you feel better  I think these folks meant well  but had I taken them up on their offers  I would have been going beyond the science  and good scientists are careful not to do this. But nevertheless  neuroscience is turning up more and more in marketing. Here's one example  Neuro drinks  a line of products  including Nuero Bliss here  which according to its label helps reduce stress  enhances mood  provides focused concentration  and promotes a positive outlook. I have to say  this sounds awesome.  Laughter  I could totally have used this    minutes ago. So when this came up in my local shop  naturally I was curious about some of the research backing these claims. So I went to the company's website looking to find some controlled trials of their products. But I didn't find any. Trial or no trial  these claims are front and center on their label right next to a picture of a brain. And it turns out that pictures of brains have special properties. A couple of researchers asked a few hundred people to read a scientific article. For half the people  the article included a brain image  and for the other half  it was the same article but it didn't have a brain image. At the end   you see where this is going   people were asked whether they agreed with the conclusions of the article. So this is how much people agree with the conclusions with no image. And this is how much they agree with the same article that did include a brain image. So the take home message here is  do you want to sell it  Put a brain on it. Now let me pause here and take a moment to say that neuroscience has advanced a lot in the last few decades  and we're constantly discovering amazing things about the brain. Like  just a couple of weeks ago  neuroscientists at MIT figured out how to break habits in rats just by controlling neural activity in a specific part of their brain. Really cool stuff. But the promise of neuroscience has led to some really high expectations and some overblown  unproven claims. So what I'm going to do is show you how to spot a couple of classic moves  dead giveaways  really  for what's variously been called neuro bunk  neuro bollocks  or  my personal favorite  neuro flapdoodle. So the first unproven claim is that you can use brain scans to read people's thoughts and emotions. Here's a study published by a team of researchers as an op ed in The New York Times. The headline   You Love Your iPhone. Literally.  It quickly became the most emailed article on the site. So how'd they figure this out  They put    people inside a brain scanner and showed them videos of ringing iPhones. The brain scans showed activation in a part of the brain called the insula  a region they say is linked to feelings of love and compassion. So they concluded that because they saw activation in the insula  this meant the subjects loved their iPhones. Now there's just one problem with this line of reasoning  and that's that the insula does a lot. Sure  it is involved in positive emotions like love and compassion  but it's also involved in tons of other processes  like memory  language  attention  even anger  disgust and pain. So based on the same logic  I could equally conclude you hate your iPhone. The point here is  when you see activation in the insula  you can't just pick and choose your favorite explanation from off this list  and it's a really long list. My colleagues Tal Yarkoni and Russ Poldrack have shown that the insula pops up in almost a third of all brain imaging studies that have ever been published. So chances are really  really good that your insula is going off right now  but I won't kid myself to think this means you love me. So speaking of love and the brain  there's a researcher  known to some as Dr. Love  who claims that scientists have found the glue that holds society together  the source of love and prosperity. This time it's not a cheese sandwich. No  it's a hormone called oxytocin. You've probably heard of it. So  Dr. Love bases his argument on studies showing that when you boost people's oxytocin  this increases their trust  empathy and cooperation. So he's calling oxytocin  the moral molecule.  Now these studies are scientifically valid  and they've been replicated  but they're not the whole story. Other studies have shown that boosting oxytocin increases envy. It increases gloating. Oxytocin can bias people to favor their own group at the expense of other groups. And in some cases  oxytocin can even decrease cooperation. So based on these studies  I could say oxytocin is an immoral molecule  and call myself Dr. Strangelove. So we've seen neuro flapdoodle all over the headlines. We see it in supermarkets  on book covers. What about the clinic  SPECT imaging is a brain scanning technology that uses a radioactive tracer to track blood flow in the brain. For the bargain price of a few thousand dollars  there are clinics in the U.S. that will give you one of these SPECT scans and use the image to help diagnose your problems. These scans  the clinics say  can help prevent Alzheimer's disease  solve weight and addiction issues  overcome marital conflicts  and treat  of course  a variety of mental illnesses ranging from depression to anxiety to ADHD. This sounds great. A lot of people agree. Some of these clinics are pulling in tens of millions of dollars a year in business. There's just one problem. The broad consensus in neuroscience is that we can't yet diagnose mental illness from a single brain scan. But these clinics have treated tens of thousands of patients to date  many of them children  and SPECT imaging involves a radioactive injection  so exposing people to radiation  potentially harmful. I am more excited than most people  as a neuroscientist  about the potential for neuroscience to treat mental illness and even maybe to make us better and smarter. And if one day we can say that cheese and chocolate help us make better decisions  count me in. But we're not there yet. We haven't found a  buy  button inside the brain  we can't tell whether someone is lying or in love just by looking at their brain scans  and we can't turn sinners into saints with hormones. Maybe someday we will  but until then  we have to be careful that we don't let overblown claims detract resources and attention away from the real science that's playing a much longer game. So here's where you come in. If someone tries to sell you something with a brain on it  don't just take them at their word. Ask the tough questions. Ask to see the evidence. Ask for the part of the story that's not being told. The answers shouldn't be simple  because the brain isn't simple. But that's not stopping us from trying to figure it out anyway. Thank you.  Applause  Photography has been my passion ever since I was old enough to pick up a camera  but today I want to share with you the    most treasured photos of mine  and I didn't take any of them. There were no art directors  no stylists  no chance for reshoots  not even any regard for lighting. In fact  most of them were taken by random tourists. My story begins when I was in New York City for a speaking engagement  and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter on her first birthday. We're on the corner of   th and  th. We happened to be back in New York exactly a year later  so we decided to take the same picture. Well you can see where this is going. Approaching my daughter's third birthday  my wife said   Hey  why don't you take Sabina back to New York and make it a father daughter trip  and continue the ritual   This is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture. You know  it's remarkable how universal the gesture is of handing your camera to a total stranger. No one's ever refused  and luckily no one's ever run off with our camera. Back then  we had no idea how much this trip would change our lives. It's really become sacred to us. This one was taken just weeks after       and I found myself trying to explain what had happened that day in ways a five year old could understand. So these photos are far more than proxies for a single moment  or even a specific trip. They're also ways for us to freeze time for one week in October and reflect on our times and how we change from year to year  and not just physically  but in every way. Because while we take the same photo  our perspectives change  and she reaches new milestones  and I get to see life through her eyes  and how she interacts with and sees everything. This very focused time we get to spend together is something we cherish and anticipate the entire year. Recently  on one trip  we were walking  and she stops dead in her tracks  and she points to a red awning of the doll store that she loved when she was little on our earlier trips. And she describes to me the feeling she felt as a five year old standing in that exact spot. She said she remembers her heart bursting out of her chest when she saw that place for the very first time nine years earlier. And now what she's looking at in New York are colleges  because she's determined to go to school in New York. And it hit me  One of the most important things we all make are memories. So I want to share the idea of taking an active role in consciously creating memories. I don't know about you  but aside from these    shots  I'm not in many of the family photos. I'm always the one taking the picture. So I want to encourage everyone today to get in the shot  and don't hesitate to go up to someone and ask   Will you take our picture   Thank you.  Applause  So a friend of mine who's a political scientist  he told me several months ago exactly what this month would be like. He said  you know  there's this fiscal cliff coming  it's going to come at the beginning of     . Both parties absolutely need to resolve it  but neither party wants to be seen as the first to resolve it. Neither party has any incentive to solve it a second before it's due  so he said  December  you're just going to see lots of angry negotiations  negotiations breaking apart  reports of phone calls that aren't going well  people saying nothing's happening at all  and then sometime around Christmas or New Year's  we're going to hear   Okay  they resolved everything.  He told me that a few months ago. He said he's    percent positive they're going to resolve it  and I got an email from him today saying  all right  we're basically on track  but now I'm    percent positive that they're going to resolve it. And it made me think. I love studying these moments in American history when there was this frenzy of partisan anger  that the economy was on the verge of total collapse. The most famous early battle was Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson over what the dollar would be and how it would be backed up  with Alexander Hamilton saying   We need a central bank  the First Bank of the United States  or else the dollar will have no value. This economy won't work   and Thomas Jefferson saying   The people won't trust that. They just fought off a king. They're not going to accept some central authority.  This battle defined the first     years of the U.S. economy  and at every moment  different partisans saying   Oh my God  the economy's about to collapse   and the rest of us just going about  spending our bucks on whatever it is we wanted to buy. To give you a quick primer on where we are  a quick refresher on where we are. So the fiscal cliff  I was told that that's too partisan a thing to say  although I can't remember which party it's supporting or attacking. People say we should call it the fiscal slope  or we should call it an austerity crisis  but then other people say  no  that's even more partisan. So I just call it the self imposed  self destructive arbitrary deadline about resolving an inevitable problem. And this is what the inevitable problem looks like. So this is a projection of U.S. debt as a percentage of our overall economy  of GDP. The light blue dotted line represents the Congressional Budget Office's best guess of what will happen if Congress really doesn't do anything  and as you can see  sometime around       we reach Greek levels of debt  somewhere around     percent of GDP  which tells you that some time in the next    years  if Congress does absolutely nothing  we're going to hit a moment where the world's investors  the world's bond buyers  are going to say   We don't trust America anymore. We're not going to lend them any money  except at really high interest rates.  And at that moment our economy collapses. But remember  Greece is there today. We're there in    years. We have lots and lots of time to avoid that crisis  and the fiscal cliff was just one more attempt at trying to force the two sides to resolve the crisis. Here's another way to look at exactly the same problem. The dark blue line is how much the government spends. The light blue line is how much the government gets in. And as you can see  for most of recent history  except for a brief period  we have consistently spent more than we take in. Thus the national debt. But as you can also see  projected going forward  the gap widens a bit and raises a bit  and this graph is only through     . It gets really  really ugly out towards     . And this graph sort of sums up what the problem is. The Democrats  they say  well  this isn't a big deal. We can just raise taxes a bit and close that gap  especially if we raise taxes on the rich. The Republicans say  hey  no  no  we've got a better idea. Why don't we lower both lines  Why don't we lower government spending and lower government taxes  and then we'll be on an even more favorable long term deficit trajectory  And behind this powerful disagreement between how to close that gap  there's the worst kind of cynical party politics  the worst kind of insider baseball  lobbying  all of that stuff  but there's also this powerfully interesting  respectful disagreement between two fundamentally different economic philosophies. And I like to think  when I picture how Republicans see the economy  what I picture is just some amazingly well engineered machine  some perfect machine. Unfortunately  I picture it made in Germany or Japan  but this amazing machine that's constantly scouring every bit of human endeavor and taking resources  money  labor  capital  machinery  away from the least productive parts and towards the more productive parts  and while this might cause temporary dislocation  what it does is it builds up the more productive areas and lets the less productive areas fade away and die  and as a result the whole system is so much more efficient  so much richer for everybody. And this view generally believes that there is a role for government  a small role  to set the rules so people aren't lying and cheating and hurting each other  maybe  you know  have a police force and a fire department and an army  but to have a very limited reach into the mechanisms of this machinery. And when I picture how Democrats and Democratic leaning economists picture this economy  most Democratic economists are  you know  they're capitalists  they believe  yes  that's a good system a lot of the time. It's good to let markets move resources to their more productive use. But that system has tons of problems. Wealth piles up in the wrong places. Wealth is ripped away from people who shouldn't be called unproductive. That's not going to create an equitable  fair society. That machine doesn't care about the environment  about racism  about all these issues that make this life worse for all of us  and so the government does have a role to take resources from more productive uses  or from richer sources  and give them to other sources. And when you think about the economy through these two different lenses  you understand why this crisis is so hard to solve  because the worse the crisis gets  the higher the stakes are  the more each side thinks they know the answer and the other side is just going to ruin everything. And I can get really despairing. I've spent a lot of the last few years really depressed about this  until this year  I learned something that I felt really excited about. I feel like it's really good news  and it's so shocking  I don't like saying it  because I think people won't believe me. But here's what I learned. The American people  taken as a whole  when it comes to these issues  to fiscal issues  are moderate  pragmatic centrists. And I know that's hard to believe  that the American people are moderate  pragmatic centrists. But let me explain what I'm thinking. When you look at how the federal government spends money  so this is the battle right here     percent  more than half  is on Social Security  Medicare  Medicaid  a few other health programs     percent defense     percent discretionary  and six percent interest. So when we're talking about cutting government spending  this is the pie we're talking about  and Americans overwhelmingly  and it doesn't matter what party they're in  overwhelmingly like that big    percent chunk. They like Social Security. They like Medicare. They even like Medicaid  even though that goes to the poor and indigent  which you might think would have less support. And they do not want it fundamentally touched  although the American people are remarkably comfortable  and Democrats roughly equal to Republicans  with some minor tweaks to make the system more stable. Social Security is fairly easy to fix. The rumors of its demise are always greatly exaggerated. So gradually raise Social Security retirement age  maybe only on people not yet born. Americans are about        whether they're Democrats or Republicans. Reduce Medicare for very wealthy seniors  seniors who make a lot of money. Don't even eliminate it. Just reduce it. People generally are comfortable with it  Democrats and Republicans. Raise medical health care contributions  Everyone hates that equally  but Republicans and Democrats hate that together. And so what this tells me is  when you look at the discussion of how to resolve our fiscal problems  we are not a nation that's powerfully divided on the major  major issue. We're comfortable with it needing some tweaks  but we want to keep it. We're not open to a discussion of eliminating it. Now there is one issue that is hyper partisan  and where there is one party that is just spend  spend  spend  we don't care  spend some more  and that of course is Republicans when it comes to military defense spending. They way outweigh Democrats. The vast majority want to protect military defense spending. That's    percent of the budget  and that presents a more difficult issue. I should also note that the  discretionary  spending  which is about    percent of the budget  that is Democratic and Republican issues  so you do have welfare  food stamps  other programs that tend to be popular among Democrats  but you also have the farm bill and all sorts of Department of Interior inducements for oil drilling and other things  which tend to be popular among Republicans. Now when it comes to taxes  there is more disagreement. That's a more partisan area. You have Democrats overwhelmingly supportive of raising the income tax on people who make         dollars a year  Republicans sort of against it  although if you break it out by income  Republicans who make less than        dollars a year like this idea. So basically Republicans who make more than         dollars a year don't want to be taxed. Raising taxes on investment income  you also see about two thirds of Democrats but only one third of Republicans are comfortable with that idea. This brings up a really important point  which is that we tend in this country to talk about Democrats and Republicans and think there's this little group over there called independents that's  what  two percent  If you add Democrats  you add Republicans  you've got the American people. But that is not the case at all. And it has not been the case for most of modern American history. Roughly a third of Americans say that they are Democrats. Around a quarter say that they are Republicans. A tiny little sliver call themselves libertarians  or socialists  or some other small third party  and the largest block     percent  say they're independents. So most Americans are not partisan  and most of the people in the independent camp fall somewhere in between  so even though we have tremendous overlap between the views on these fiscal issues of Democrats and Republicans  we have even more overlap when you add in the independents. Now we get to fight about all sorts of other issues. We get to hate each other on gun control and abortion and the environment  but on these fiscal issues  these important fiscal issues  we just are not anywhere nearly as divided as people say. And in fact  there's this other group of people who are not as divided as people might think  and that group is economists. I talk to a lot of economists  and back in the '  s and '  s it was ugly being an economist. You were in what they called the saltwater camp  meaning Harvard  Princeton  MIT  Stanford  Berkeley  or you were in the freshwater camp  University of Chicago  University of Rochester. You were a free market capitalist economist or you were a Keynesian liberal economist  and these people didn't go to each other's weddings  they snubbed each other at conferences. It's still ugly to this day  but in my experience  it is really  really hard to find an economist under    who still has that kind of way of seeing the world. The vast majority of economists    it is so uncool to call yourself an ideologue of either camp. The phrase that you want  if you're a graduate student or a postdoc or you're a professor  a    year old economics professor  is   I'm an empiricist. I go by the data.  And the data is very clear. None of these major theories have been completely successful. The   th century  the last hundred years  is riddled with disastrous examples of times that one school or the other tried to explain the past or predict the future and just did an awful  awful job  so the economics profession has acquired some degree of modesty. They still are an awfully arrogant group of people  I will assure you  but they're now arrogant about their impartiality  and they  too  see a tremendous range of potential outcomes. And this nonpartisanship is something that exists  that has existed in secret in America for years and years and years. I've spent a lot of the fall talking to the three major organizations that survey American political attitudes  Pew Research  the University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center  and the most important but the least known is the American National Election Studies group that is the world's longest  most respected poll of political attitudes. They've been doing it since       and what they show consistently throughout is that it's almost impossible to find Americans who are consistent ideologically  who consistently support   No we mustn't tax  and we must limit the size of government   or   No  we must encourage government to play a larger role in redistribution and correcting the ills of capitalism.  Those groups are very  very small. The vast majority of people  they pick and choose  they see compromise and they change over time when they hear a better argument or a worse argument. And that part of it has not changed. What has changed is how people respond to vague questions. If you ask people vague questions  like   Do you think there should be more government or less government    Do you think government should    especially if you use loaded language     Do you think the government should provide handouts   Or   Do you think the government should redistribute   Then you can see radical partisan change. But when you get specific  when you actually ask about the actual taxing and spending issues under consideration  people are remarkably centrist  they're remarkably open to compromise. So what we have  then  when you think about the fiscal cliff  don't think of it as the American people fundamentally can't stand each other on these issues and that we must be ripped apart into two separate warring nations. Think of it as a tiny  tiny number of ancient economists and misrepresentative ideologues have captured the process. And they've captured the process through familiar ways  through a primary system which encourages that small group of people's voices  because that small group of people  the people who answer all yeses or all noes on those ideological questions  they might be small but every one of them has a blog  every one of them has been on Fox or MSNBC in the last week. Every one of them becomes a louder and louder voice  but they don't represent us. They don't represent what our views are. And that gets me back to the dollar  and it gets me back to reminding myself that we know this experience. We know what it's like to have these people on TV  in Congress  yelling about how the end of the world is coming if we don't adopt their view completely  because it's happened about the dollar ever since there's been a dollar. We had the battle between Jefferson and Hamilton. In       we had this ugly battle over the Federal Reserve  when it was created  with vicious  angry arguments over how it would be constituted  and a general agreement that the way it was constituted was the worst possible compromise  a compromise guaranteed to destroy this valuable thing  this dollar  but then everyone agreeing  okay  so long as we're on the gold standard  it should be okay. The Fed can't mess it up so badly. But then we got off the gold standard for individuals during the Depression and we got off the gold standard as a source of international currency coordination during Richard Nixon's presidency. Each of those times  we were on the verge of complete collapse. And nothing happened at all. Throughout it all  the dollar has been one of the most long standing  stable  reasonable currencies  and we all use it every single day  no matter what the people screaming about tell us  no matter how scared we're supposed to be. And this long term fiscal picture that we're in right now  I think what is most maddening about it is  if Congress were simply able to show not that they agree with each other  not that they're able to come up with the best possible compromise  but that they are able to just begin the process towards compromise  we all instantly are better off. The fear is that the world is watching. The fear is that the longer we delay any solution  the more the world will look to the U.S. not as the bedrock of stability in the global economy  but as a place that can't resolve its own fights  and the longer we put that off  the more we make the world nervous  the higher interest rates are going to be  the quicker we're going to have to face a day of horrible calamity. And so just the act of compromise itself  and sustained  real compromise  would give us even more time  would allow both sides even longer to spread out the pain and reach even more compromise down the road. So I'm in the media. I feel like my job to make this happen is to help foster the things that seem to lead to compromise  to not talk about this in those vague and scary terms that do polarize us  but to just talk about it like what it is  not an existential crisis  not some battle between two fundamentally different religious views  but a math problem  a really solvable math problem  one where we're not all going to get what we want and one where  you know  there's going to be a little pain to spread around. But the more we address it as a practical concern  the sooner we can resolve it  and the more time we have to resolve it  paradoxically. Thank you.  Applause  On March     this year  I posted this poster on Facebook. This is an image of me and my daughter holding the Israeli flag. I will try to explain to you about the context of why and when I posted. A few days ago  I was sitting waiting on the line at the grocery store  and the owner and one of the clients were talking to each other  and the owner was explaining to the client that we're going to get        missiles on Israel. And the client was saying  no  it's        a day. We have this war with Iran coming for    years now  and we have people  you know  afraid. It's like every year it's the last minute that we can do something about the war with Iran. It's like  if we don't act now  it's too late forever  for    years now. So at some point it became  you know  to me  I'm a graphic designer  so I made posters about it and I posted the one I just showed you before. Most of the time  I make posters  I post them on Facebook  my friends like it  don't like it  most of the time don't like it  don't share it  don't nothing  and it's another day. So I went to sleep  and that was it for me. And later on in the night  I woke up because I'm always waking up in the night  and I went by the computer and I see all these red dots  you know  on Facebook  which I've never seen before. And I was like   What's going on   So I come to the computer and I start looking on  and suddenly I see many people talking to me  most of them I don't know  and a few of them from Iran  which is    What  Because you have to understand  in Israel we don't talk with people from Iran. We don't know people from Iran. It's like  on Facebook  you have friends only from    it's like your neighbors are your friends on Facebook. And now people from Iran are talking to me. So I start answering this girl  and she's telling me she saw the poster and she asked her family to come  because they don't have a computer  she asked her family to come to see the poster  and they're all sitting in the living room crying. So I'm like  whoa. I ask my wife to come  and I tell her  you have to see that. People are crying  and she came  she read the text  and she started to cry. And everybody's crying now.  Laughter  So I don't know what to do  so my first reflex  as a graphic designer  is  you know  to show everybody what I'd just seen  and people started to see them and to share them  and that's how it started. The day after  when really it became a lot of talking  I said to myself  and my wife said to me  I also want a poster  so this is her.  Laughter  Because it's working  put me in a poster now. But more seriously  I was like  okay  these ones work  but it's not just about me  it's about people from Israel who want to say something. So I'm going to shoot all the people I know  if they want  and I'm going to put them in a poster and I'm going to share them. So I went to my neighbors and friends and students and I just asked them  give me a picture  I will make you a poster. And that's how it started. And that's how  really  it's unleashed  because suddenly people from Facebook  friends and others  just understand that they can be part of it. It's not just one dude making one poster  it's    we can be part of it  so they start sending me pictures and ask me   Make me a poster. Post it. Tell the Iranians we from Israel love you too.  It became  you know  at some point it was really  really intense. I mean  so many pictures  so I asked friends to come  graphic designers most of them  to make posters with me  because I didn't have the time. It was a huge amount of pictures. So for a few days  that's how my living room was. And we received Israeli posters  Israeli images  but also lots of comments  lots of messages from Iran. And we took these messages and we made posters out of it  because I know people  They don't read  they see images. If it's an image  they may read it. So here are a few of them. of a girl who has been raised in Iran to walk on an Israeli flag to enter her school every morning  and now that she sees the posters that we're sending  she starts    she said that she changed her mind  and now she loves that blue  she loves that star  and she loves that flag  talking about the Israeli flag  and she wished that we'd meet and come to visit one another  and just a few days after I posted the first poster. The day after  Iranians started to respond with their own posters. They have graphic designers. What   Laughter  Crazy  crazy. So you can see they are still shy  they don't want to show their faces  but they want to spread the message. They want to respond. They want to say the same thing. So. And now it's communication. It's a two way story. It's Israelis and Iranians sending the same message  one to each other. This never happened before  and this is two people supposed to be enemies  we're on the verge of a war  and suddenly people on Facebook are starting to say   I like this guy. I love those guys.  And it became really big at some point. And then it became news. Because when you're seeing the Middle East  you see only the bad news. And suddenly  there is something that was happening that was good news. So the guys on the news  they say   Okay  let's talk about this.  And they just came  and it was so much  I remember one day  Michal  she was talking with the journalist  and she was asking him   Who's gonna see the show  And he said   Everybody.  So she said   Everybody in Palestine  in where  Israel  Who is everybody   Everybody.  They said   Syria    Syria.   Lebanon   Lebanon.  At some point  he just said      million people are going to see you today. It's everybody.  The Chinese. And we were just at the beginning of the story. Something crazy also happened. Every time a country started talking about it  like Germany  America  wherever  a page on Facebook popped up with the same logo with the same stories  so at the beginning we had  Iran Loves Israel   which is an Iranian sitting in Tehran  saying   Okay  Israel loves Iran  I give you Iran Loves Israel.  You have Palestine Loves Israel. You have Lebanon that just    a few days ago. And this whole list of pages on Facebook dedicated to the same message  to people sending their love  one to each other. The moment I really understood that something was happening  a friend of mine told me   Google the word 'Israel.'  And those were the first images on those days that popped up from Google when you were typing   Israel  or  Iran.  We really changed how people see the Middle East. Because you're not in the Middle East. You're somewhere over there  and then you want to see the Middle East  so you go on Google and you say   Israel   and they give you the bad stuff. And for a few days you got those images. Today the Israel Loves Iran page is this number          and two million people last week went on the page and shared  liked  I don't know  commented on one of the photos. So for five months now  that's what we are doing  me  Michal  a few of my friends  are just making images. We're showing a new reality by just making images because that's how the world perceives us. They see images of us  and they see bad images. So we're working on making good images. End of story. Look at this one. This is the Iran Loves Israel page. This is not the Israel Loves Iran. This is not my page. This is a guy in Tehran on the day of remembrance of the Israeli fallen soldier putting an image of an Israeli soldier on his page. This is the enemy. What  And it's going both ways. It's like  we are showing respect  one to each other. And we're understanding. And you show compassion. And you become friends. And at some point  you become friends on Facebook  and you become friends in life. You can go and travel and meet people. And I was in Munich a few weeks ago. I went there to open an exposition about Iran and I met there with people from the page that told me   Okay  you're going to be in Europe  I'm coming. I'm coming from France  from Holland  from Germany   of course  and from Israel people came  and we just met there for the first time in real life. I met with people that are supposed to be my enemies for the first time. And we just shake hands  and have a coffee and a nice discussion  and we talk about food and basketball. And that was the end of it. Remember that image from the beginning  At some point we met in real life  and we became friends. And it goes the other way around. Some girl that we met on Facebook never been in Israel  born and raised in Iran  lives in Germany  afraid of Israelis because of what she knows about us  decides after a few months of talking on the Internet with some Israelis to come to Israel  and she gets on the plane and arrives at Ben Gurion and says   Okay  not that big a deal.  So a few weeks ago  the stress is getting higher  so we start this new campaign called  Not ready to die in your war.  I mean  it's plus minus the same message  but we wanted really to add some aggressivity to it. And again  something amazing happened  something that we didn't have on the first wave of the campaign. Now people from Iran  the same ones who were shy at the first campaign and just sent  you know  their foot and half their faces  now they're sending their faces  and they're saying   Okay  no problem  we're into it. We are with you.  Just read where those guys are from. And for every guy from Israel  you've got someone from Iran. Just people sending their pictures. Crazy  yes  So    So you may ask yourself  who is this dude  My name is Ronny Edry  and I'm     I'm an Israeli  I'm a father of two  I'm a husband  and I'm a graphic designer. I'm teaching graphic design. And I'm not that naive  because a lot of the time I've been asked  many times I've been asked   Yeah  but  this is really naive  sending flowers over  I mean     I was in the army. I was in the paratroopers for three years  and I know how it looks from the ground. I know how it can look really bad. So to me  this is the courageous thing to do  to try to reach the other side before it's too late  because when it's going to be too late  it's going to be too late. And sometimes war is inevitable  sometimes  but maybe  with  effort  we can avoid it. Maybe as people  because especially in Israel  we're in a democracy. We have the freedom of speech  and maybe that little thing can change something. And really  we can be our own ambassadors. We can just send a message and hope for the best. So I want to ask Michal  my wife  to come with me on the stage just to make with you one image  because it's all about images. And maybe that image will help us change something. Just raise that. Exactly. And I'm just going to take a picture of it  and I'm just going to post it on Facebook with kind of  Israelis for peace  or something. Oh my God. Don't cry. Thank you guys.
