  Thank you so much  Chris. And it's truly a great honor to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice  I'm extremely grateful. I have been blown away by this conference  and I want to thank all of you for the many nice comments about what I had to say the other night. And I say that sincerely  partly because  Mock sob  I need that. Put yourselves in my position. I flew on Air Force Two for eight years. Now I have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane  I'll tell you one quick story to illustrate what that's been like for me. It's a true story    every bit of this is true. Soon after Tipper and I left the     Mock sob  White House    we were driving from our home in Nashville to a little farm we have    miles east of Nashville. Driving ourselves. I know it sounds like a little thing to you  but    I looked in the rear view mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me. There was no motorcade back there. You've heard of phantom limb pain  This was a rented Ford Taurus. It was dinnertime  and we started looking for a place to eat. We were on I   . We got to Exit      Lebanon  Tennessee. We got off the exit  we found a Shoney's restaurant. Low cost family restaurant chain  for those of you who don't know it. We went in and sat down at the booth  and the waitress came over  made a big commotion over Tipper. She took our order  and then went to the couple in the booth next to us  and she lowered her voice so much  I had to really strain to hear what she was saying. And she said  Yes  that's former Vice President Al Gore and his wife  Tipper.  And the man said   He's come down a long way  hasn't he   There's been kind of a series of epiphanies. The very next day  continuing the totally true story  I got on a G V to fly to Africa to make a speech in Nigeria  in the city of Lagos  on the topic of energy. And I began the speech by telling them the story of what had just happened the day before in Nashville. And I told it pretty much the same way I've just shared it with you  Tipper and I were driving ourselves  Shoney's  low cost family restaurant chain  what the man said    they laughed. I gave my speech  then went back out to the airport to fly back home. I fell asleep on the plane until  during the middle of the night  we landed on the Azores Islands for refueling. I woke up  they opened the door  I went out to get some fresh air  and I looked  and there was a man running across the runway. And he was waving a piece of paper  and he was yelling   Call Washington  Call Washington   And I thought to myself  in the middle of the night  in the middle of the Atlantic  what in the world could be wrong in Washington  Then I remembered it could be a bunch of things. But what it turned out to be  was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services in Nigeria had already written a story about my speech  and it had already been printed in cities all across the United States of America. It was printed in Monterey  I checked. And the story began   Former Vice President Al Gore announced in Nigeria yesterday   quote  'My wife Tipper and I have opened a low cost family restaurant'      'named Shoney's  and we are running it ourselves.'  Before I could get back to U.S. soil  David Letterman and Jay Leno had already started in on    one of them had me in a big white chef's hat  Tipper was saying   One more burger with fries   Three days later  I got a nice  long  handwritten letter from my friend and partner and colleague Bill Clinton  saying   Congratulations on the new restaurant  Al   We like to celebrate each other's successes in life. I was going to talk about information ecology. But I was thinking that  since I plan to make a lifelong habit of coming back to TED  that maybe I could talk about that another time. Chris Anderson  It's a deal  Al Gore  I want to focus on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on  What can you do about the climate crisis  I want to start with a couple of    I'm going to show some new images  and I'm going to recapitulate just four or five. Now  the slide show. I update the slide show every time I give it. I add new images  because I learn more about it every time I give it. It's like beach combing  you know  Every time the tide comes in and out  you find some more shells. Just in the last two days  we got the new temperature records in January. This is just for the United States of America. Historical average for Januarys is    degrees  last month was   .  degrees. Now  I know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment    I'm kidding. But these are the recapitulation slides  and then I'm going to go into new material about what you can do. But I wanted to elaborate on a couple of these. First of all  this is where we're projected to go with the U.S. contribution to global warming  under business as usual. Efficiency in end use electricity and end use of all energy is the low hanging fruit. Efficiency and conservation    it's not a cost  it's a profit. The sign is wrong. It's not negative  it's positive. These are investments that pay for themselves. But they are also very effective in deflecting our path. Cars and trucks    I talked about that in the slideshow  but I want you to put it in perspective. It's an easy  visible target of concern    and it should be    but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks. Cars and trucks are very significant  and we have the lowest standards in the world. And so we should address that. But it's part of the puzzle. Other transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks. Renewables at the current levels of technological efficiency can make this much difference. And with what Vinod  and John Doerr and others  many of you here    there are a lot of people directly involved in this    this wedge is going to grow much more rapidly than the current projection shows it. Carbon Capture and Sequestration    that's what CCS stands for    is likely to become the killer app that will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe. Not quite there yet. OK. Now  what can you do  Reduce emissions in your home. Most of these expenditures are also profitable. Insulation  better design. Buy green electricity where you can. I mentioned automobiles    buy a hybrid. Use light rail. Figure out some of the other options that are much better. It's important. Be a green consumer. You have choices with everything you buy  between things that have a harsh effect  or a much less harsh effect on the global climate crisis. Consider this  Make a decision to live a carbon neutral life. Those of you who are good at branding  I'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people. It is easier than you think. It really is. A lot of us in here have made that decision  and it is really pretty easy. It means reduce your carbon dioxide emissions with the full range of choices that you make  and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not completely reduced. And what it means is elaborated at climatecrisis.net. There is a carbon calculator. Participant Productions convened    with my active involvement    the leading software writers in the world  on this arcane science of carbon calculation  to construct a consumer friendly carbon calculator. You can very precisely calculate what your CO  emissions are  and then you will be given options to reduce. And by the time the movie comes out in May  this will be updated to  .   and we will have click through purchases of offsets. Next  consider making your business carbon neutral. Again  some of us have done that  and it's not as hard as you think. Integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations  whether you are from the technology  or entertainment  or design and architecture community. Invest sustainably. Majora mentioned this. Listen  if you have invested money with managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance  don't ever again complain about quarterly report CEO management. Over time  people do what you pay them to do. And if they judge how much they're going to get paid on your capital that they've invested  based on the short term returns  you're going to get short term decisions. A lot more to be said about that. Become a catalyst of change. Teach others  learn about it  talk about it. The movie is a movie version of the slideshow I gave two nights ago  except it's a lot more entertaining. And it comes out in May. Many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it. Consider sending somebody to Nashville. Pick well. And I am personally going to train people to give this slideshow    re purposed  with some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach  and it's not just the slides  it's what they mean. And it's how they link together. And so I'm going to be conducting a course this summer for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse  in communities all across the country  and we're going to update the slideshow for all of them every single week  to keep it right on the cutting edge. Working with Larry Lessig  it will be  somewhere in that process  posted with tools and limited use copyrights  so that young people can remix it and do it in their own way. Where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay arm's length from politics  It doesn't mean that if you're a Republican  that I'm trying to convince you to be a Democrat. We need Republicans as well. This used to be a bipartisan issue  and I know that in this group it really is. Become politically active. Make our democracy work the way it's supposed to work. Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions    global warming pollution    and trading it. Here's why  as long as the United States is out of the world system  it's not a closed system. Once it becomes a closed system  with U.S. participation  then everybody who's on a board of directors    how many people here serve on the board of directors of a corporation  Once it's a closed system  you will have legal liability if you do not urge your CEO to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided. The market will work to solve this problem    if we can accomplish this. Help with the mass persuasion campaign that will start this spring. We have to change the minds of the American people. Because presently  the politicians do not have permission to do what needs to be done. And in our modern country  the role of logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power the way it once did. It's now repetition of short  hot button     second     second television ads. We have to buy a lot of those ads. Let's re brand global warming  as many of you have suggested. I like  climate crisis  instead of  climate collapse   but again  those of you who are good at branding  I need your help on this. Somebody said the test we're facing now  a scientist told me  is whether the combination of an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination. That's really true. I said the other night  and I'll repeat now  this is not a political issue. Again  the Republicans here    this shouldn't be partisan. You have more influence than some of us who are Democrats do. This is an opportunity. Not just this  but connected to the ideas that are here  to bring more coherence to them. We are one. Thank you very much  I appreciate it. Hello voice mail  my old friend. I've called for tech support again. I ignored my boss's warning. I called on a Monday morning. Now it's evening  and my dinner first grew cold  and then grew mold. I'm still on hold. I'm listening to the sounds of silence. I don't think you understand. I think your phone lines are unmanned. I punched every touch tone I was told  but I've still spent    hours on hold. It's not enough your software crashed my Mac  and it constantly hangs and bombs    it erased my ROMs  Now the Mac makes the sounds of silence. In my dreams I fantasize of wreaking vengeance on you guys. Say your motorcycle crashes. Blood comes gushing from your gashes. With your fading strength  you call       and you pray for a trained MD. But you get me. And you listen to the sounds of silence. Thank you. Good evening and welcome to   Spot the TED Presenter Who Used to Be a Broadway Accompanist.  When I was offered the Times column six years ago  the deal was like this  you'll be sent the coolest  hottest  slickest new gadgets. Every week  it'll arrive at your door. You get to try them out  play with them  evaluate them until the novelty wears out  before you have to send them back  and you'll get paid for it. You can think about it  if you want. So  I've always been a technology nut  and I absolutely love it. The job  though  came with one small downside  and that is  they intended to publish my email address at the end of every column. And what I've noticed is    first of all  you get an incredible amount of email. If you ever are feeling lonely  get a New York Times column  because you will get hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of emails. And the email I'm getting a lot today is about frustration. People are feeling like things    Ok  I just had an alarm come up on my screen. Lucky you can't see it. People are feeling overwhelmed. They're feeling like it's too much technology  too fast. It may be good technology  but I feel like there's not enough of a support structure. There's not enough help. There's not enough thought put into the design of it to make it easy and enjoyable to use. One time I wrote a column about my efforts to reach Dell Technical Support  and within    hours  there were     messages from readers on the feedback boards on the Times website  from users saying    Me too  and here's my tale of woe.  I call it  software rage.  And man  let me tell you  whoever figures out how to make money off of this frustration will    Oh  how did that get up there  Just kidding. Ok  so why is the problem accelerating  And part of the problem is  ironically  because the industry has put so much thought into making things easier to use. I'll show you what I mean. This is what the computer interface used to look like  DOS. Over the years  it's gotten easier to use. This is the original Mac operating system. Reagan was President. Madonna was still a brunette. And the entire operating system    this is the good part    the entire operating system fit in     k. You couldn't put the Mac OS X logo in     k  So the irony is  that as these things became easier to use  a less technical  broader audience was coming into contact with this equipment for the first time. I once had the distinct privilege of sitting in on the Apple call center for a day. The guy had a duplicate headset for me to listen to. And the calls that    you know how they say   Your call may be recorded for quality assurance   Uh uh. Your call may be recorded so that they can collect the funniest dumb user stories and pass them around on a CD. Which they do. And I have a copy. It's in your gift bag. No  no. With your voices on it  So  some of the stories are just so classic  and yet so understandable. A woman called Apple to complain that her mouse was squeaking. Making a squeaking noise. And the technician said   Well  ma'am  what do you mean your mouse is squeaking   She says   All I can tell you is that it squeaks louder  the faster I move it across the screen.  And the technician's like   Ma'am  you've got the mouse up against the screen   She goes   Well  the message said  'Click here to continue.'  Well  if you like that one    how much time have we got  Another one  a guy called    this is absolutely true    his computer had crashed  and he told the technician he couldn't restart it  no matter how many times he typed    .  And the technician said   What  Why are you typing      He said   The message says  'Error Type   .'  So  we must admit that some of the blame falls squarely at the feet of the users. But why is the technical overload crisis  the complexity crisis  accelerating now  In the hardware world  it's because we the consumers want everything to be smaller  smaller  smaller. So the gadgets are getting tinier and tinier  but our fingers are essentially staying the same size. So it gets to be more and more of a challenge. Software is subject to another primal force  the mandate to release more and more versions. When you buy a piece of software  it's not like buying a vase or a candy bar  where you own it. It's more like joining a club  where you pay dues every year  and every year  they say   We've added more features  and we'll sell it to you for    .  I know one guy who's spent        just on Photoshop over the years. And software companies make    percent of their revenue from just these software upgrades. I call it the Software Upgrade Paradox    which is that if you improve a piece of software enough times  you eventually ruin it. I mean  Microsoft Word was last just a word processor in  you know  the Eisenhower administration. But what's the alternative  Microsoft actually did this experiment. They said   Well  wait a minute. Everyone complains that we're adding so many features. Let's create a word processor that's just a word processor  Simple  pure  does not do web pages  is not a database.  And it came out  and it was called Microsoft Write. And none of you are nodding in acknowledgment  because it died. It tanked. No one ever bought it. I call this the Sport Utility Principle. People like to surround themselves with unnecessary power  right  They don't need the database and the website  but they're like   Well  I'll upgrade  because  I might  you know  I might need that someday.  So the problem is  as you add more features  where are they going to go  Where are you going to stick them  You only have so many design tools. You can do buttons  you can do sliders  pop up menus  sub menus. But if you're not careful about how you choose  you wind up with this. This is an un retouched    this is not a joke    un retouched photo of Microsoft Word  the copy that you have  with all the toolbars open. You've obviously never opened all the toolbars  but all you have to type in is this little  teeny window down here. And we've arrived at the age of interface matrices  where there are so many features and options  you have to do two dimensions  you know  a vertical and a horizontal. You guys all complain about how Microsoft Word is always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically. The off switch is in there somewhere. I'm telling you    it's there. Part of the art of designing a simple  good interface  is knowing when to use which one of these features. So  here is the log off dialogue box for Windows     . There are only four choices  so why are they in a pop up menu  It's not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components that you need to collapse the choices. They could have put them all out in view. Here's Apple's take on the exact same dialogue box. Thank you    yes  I designed the dialogue box. No  no. Already  we can see that Apple and Microsoft have a severely divergent approach to software design. Microsoft's approach to simplicity tends to be  let's break it down  let's just make it more steps. There are these  wizards  everywhere. And you know  there's a new version of Windows coming out this fall. If they continue at this pace  there's absolutely no telling where they might wind up.  Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard   Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard.  Ok  I'll bite. Let's click  Next  to continue. From the drop down menu  choose the first letter you want to type. Ok. So there is a limit that we don't want to cross. So what is the answer  How do you pack in all these features in a simple  intelligent way  I believe in consistency  when possible  real world equivalents  trash can folder  when possible  label things  mostly. But I beg of the designers here to break all those rules if they violate the biggest rule of all  which is intelligence. Now what do I mean by that  I'm going to give you some examples where intelligence makes something not consistent  but it's better. If you are buying something on the web  you're supposed to put in your address  and you're supposed to choose what country you're from  ok  There are     countries in the world. We like to think of the Internet as a global village. I'm sorry  it's not one yet. It's mainly like  the United States  Europe  and Japan. So why is  United States  in the  U s  You have to scroll  like  seven screensful to get to it. Now  it would be inconsistent to put  United States  first  but it would be intelligent. This one's been touched on before  but why in God's name do you shut down a Windows PC by clicking a button called  Start   Here's another pet one of mine  you have a printer. Most of the time  you want to print one copy of your document  in page order  on that printer. So why in God's name do you see this every time you print  It's like a     shuttle cockpit. And one of the buttons at the bottom  you'll notice  is not  Print.  Now  I'm not saying that Apple is the only company who has embraced the cult of simplicity. Palm is also  especially in the old days  wonderful about this. I actually got to speak to Palm when they were flying high in the '  s  and after the talk  I met one of the employees. He says   Nice talk.  And I said   Thank you. What do you do here   He said   I'm a tap counter.  I'm like   You're a what   He goes   Well Jeff Hawkins  the CEO  says  'If any task on the Palm Pilot takes more than three taps of the stylus  it's too long  and it has to be redesigned.' So I'm the tap counter.  So  I'm going to show you an example of a company that does not have a tap counter. This is Microsoft Word. Ok  when you want to create a new blank document in Word    it could happen. You go up to the  File  menu and you choose  New.  Now  what happens when you choose  New   Do you get a new blank document  You do not. On the opposite side of the monitor  a task bar appears  and somewhere in those links    by the way  not at the top    somewhere in those links is a button that makes you a new document. Ok  so that is a company not counting taps. You know  I don't want to just stand here and make fun of Microsoft ... Yes  I do. The Bill Gates song  I've been a geek forever and I wrote the very first DOS. I put my software and IBM together  I got profit and they got the loss. I write the code that makes the whole world run. I'm getting royalties from everyone. Sometimes it's garbage  but the press is snowed. You buy the box  I'll sell the code. Every software company is doing Microsoft's R D. You can't keep a good idea down these days. Even Windows is a hack. We're kind of based loosely on the Mac. So it's big  so it's slow. You've got nowhere to go. I'm not doing this for praise. I write the code that fits the world today. Big mediocrity in every way. We've entered planet domination mode. You'll have no choice  you'll buy my code. I am Bill Gates and I write the code. But actually  I believe there are really two Microsofts. There's the old one  responsible for Windows and Office. They're dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh  but they can't. They're locked in  because so many add ons and other company stuff locks into the old      chassis. But there's also a new Microsoft  that's really doing good  simple interface designs. I liked the Media Center PC. I liked the Microsoft SPOT Watch. The Wireless Watch flopped miserably in the market  but it wasn't because it wasn't simply and beautifully designed. But let's put it this way  would you pay     a month to have a watch that has to be recharged every night like your cell phone  and stops working when you leave your area code  So  the signs might indicate that the complexity crunch is only going to get worse. So is there any hope  The screens are getting smaller  people are illuminating  putting manuals in the boxes  things are coming out at a faster pace. It's funny    when Steve Jobs came back to Apple in       after    years away  it was the MacWorld Expo    he came to the stage in that black turtleneck and jeans  and he sort of did this. The crowd went wild  but I had just seen    I'm like  where have I seen this before  I had just seen the movie  Evita     with Madonna  and I'm like  you know what  I've got to do one about Steve Jobs. It won't be easy. You'll think I'm strange. When I try to explain why I'm back  after telling the press Apple's future is black. You won't believe me. All that you see is a kid in his teens who started out in a garage with only a buddy named Woz. You try rhyming with garage  Don't cry for me  Cupertino. The truth is  I never left you. I know the ropes now  know what the tricks are. I made a fortune over at Pixar. Don't cry for me  Cupertino. I've still got the drive and vision. I still wear sandals in any weather. It's just that these days  they're Gucci leather. Thank you. So Steve Jobs had always believed in simplicity and elegance and beauty. And the truth is  for years I was a little depressed  because Americans obviously did not value it  because the Mac had three percent market share  Windows had    percent market share    people did not think it was worth putting a price on it. So I was a little depressed. And then I heard Al Gore's talk  and I realized I didn't know the meaning of depressed. But it turns out I was wrong  right  Because the iPod came out  and it violated every bit of common wisdom. Other products cost less  other products had more features  they had voice recorders and FM transmitters. The other products were backed by Microsoft  with an open standard  not Apple's propriety standard. But the iPod won    this is the one they wanted. The lesson was  simplicity sells. And there are signs that the industry is getting the message. This is a little company that's done very well with simplicity and elegance. The Sonos thing    it's catching on. I've got just a couple examples. Physically  a really cool  elegant thinking coming along lately. When you have a digital camera  how do you get the pictures back to your computer  Well  you either haul around a USB cable  or you buy a card reader and haul that around. Either one  you're going to lose. What I do is  I take out the memory card  and I fold it in half  revealing USB contacts. I just stick it in the computer  offload the pictures  put it right back in the camera. I never have to lose anything. Here's another example. Chris  you're the source of all power. Will you be my power plug  Chris Anderson  Oh yeah. DP  Hold that and don't let go. You might've seen this  this is Apple's new laptop. This the power cord. It hooks on like this. And I'm sure every one of you has done this at some point in your lives  or one of your children. You walk along    and I'm about to pull this onto the floor. I don't care. It's a loaner. Here we go. Whoa  It's magnetic    it doesn't pull the laptop onto the floor. In my very last example    I do a lot of my work using speech recognition software. And I'll just    you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous. Speech recognition software is really great for doing emails very quickly  period. Like  I get hundreds of them a day  period. And it's not just what I dictate that it writes down  period. I also use this feature called voice macros  period. Correct  dissuade.  Not  just.  Ok  this is not an ideal situation  because it's getting the echo from the hall and stuff. The point is  I can respond to people very quickly by saying a short word  and having it write out a much longer thing. So if somebody sends me a fan letter  I'll say   Thanks for that.   Thank you so much for taking the time to write ...  And conversely  if somebody sends me hate mail    which happens daily    I say   Piss off.   I admire your frankness ...  So that's my dirty little secret. Don't tell anyone. So the point is    this is a really interesting story. This is version eight of this software  and do you know what they put in version eight  No new features. It's never happened before in software  The company put no new features. They just said   We'll make this software work right.  Right  Because for years  people had bought this software  tried it out       percent accuracy was all they got  which means one in    words is wrong    and they'd put it in their drawer. And the company got sick of that  so they said   This version  we're not going to do anything  but make sure it's darned accurate.  And so that's what they did. This cult of doing things right is starting to spread. So  my final advice for those of you who are consumers of this technology  remember  if it doesn't work  it's not necessarily you  ok  It could be the design of the thing you're using. Be aware in life of good design and bad design. And if you're among the people who create this stuff  Easy is hard. Pre sweat the details for your audience. Count the taps. Remember  the hard part is not deciding what features to add  it's deciding what to leave out. And best of all  your motivation is  simplicity sells. CA  Bravo. DP  Thank you very much. CA  Hear  hear  If you're here today    and I'm very happy that you are    you've all heard about how sustainable development will save us from ourselves. However  when we're not at TED  we are often told that a real sustainability policy agenda is just not feasible  especially in large urban areas like New York City. And that's because most people with decision making powers  in both the public and the private sector  really don't feel as though they're in danger. The reason why I'm here today  in part  is because of a dog    an abandoned puppy I found back in the rain  back in     . She turned out to be a much bigger dog than I'd anticipated. When she came into my life  we were fighting against a huge waste facility planned for the East River waterfront despite the fact that our small part of New York City already handled more than    percent of the entire city's commercial waste  a sewage treatment pelletizing plant  a sewage sludge plant  four power plants  the world's largest food distribution center  as well as other industries that bring more than        diesel truck trips to the area each week. The area also has one of the lowest ratios of parks to people in the city. So when I was contacted by the Parks Department about a         seed grant initiative to help develop waterfront projects  I thought they were really well meaning  but a bit naive. I'd lived in this area all my life  and you could not get to the river  because of all the lovely facilities that I mentioned earlier. Then  while jogging with my dog one morning  she pulled me into what I thought was just another illegal dump. There were weeds and piles of garbage and other stuff that I won't mention here  but she kept dragging me  and lo and behold  at the end of that lot was the river. I knew that this forgotten little street end  abandoned like the dog that brought me there  was worth saving. And I knew it would grow to become the proud beginnings of the community led revitalization of the new South Bronx. And just like my new dog  it was an idea that got bigger than I'd imagined. We garnered much support along the way  and the Hunts Point Riverside Park became the first waterfront park that the South Bronx had had in more than    years. We leveraged that         seed grant more than     times  into a    million park. And in the fall  I'm going to exchange marriage vows with my beloved. Thank you very much. That's him pressing my buttons back there  which he does all the time. But those of us living in environmental justice communities are the canary in the coal mine. We feel the problems right now  and have for some time. Environmental justice  for those of you who may not be familiar with the term  goes something like this  no community should be saddled with more environmental burdens and less environmental benefits than any other. Unfortunately  race and class are extremely reliable indicators as to where one might find the good stuff  like parks and trees  and where one might find the bad stuff  like power plants and waste facilities. As a black person in America  I am twice as likely as a white person to live in an area where air pollution poses the greatest risk to my health. I am five times more likely to live within walking distance of a power plant or chemical facility  which I do. These land use decisions created the hostile conditions that lead to problems like obesity  diabetes and asthma. Why would someone leave their home to go for a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood  Our    percent obesity rate is high even for this country  and diabetes comes with it. One out of four South Bronx children has asthma. Our asthma hospitalization rate is seven times higher than the national average. These impacts are coming everyone's way. And we all pay dearly for solid waste costs  health problems associated with pollution and more odiously  the cost of imprisoning our young black and Latino men  who possess untold amounts of untapped potential. Fifty percent of our residents live at or below the poverty line     percent of us are unemployed. Low income citizens often use emergency room visits as primary care. This comes at a high cost to taxpayers and produces no proportional benefits. Poor people are not only still poor  they are still unhealthy. Fortunately  there are many people like me who are striving for solutions that won't compromise the lives of low income communities of color in the short term  and won't destroy us all in the long term. None of us want that  and we all have that in common. So what else do we have in common  Well  first of all  we're all incredibly good looking. Graduated high school  college  post graduate degrees  traveled to interesting places  didn't have kids in your early teens  financially stable  never been imprisoned. OK. Good. But  besides being a black woman  I am different from most of you in some other ways. I watched nearly half of the buildings in my neighborhood burn down. My big brother Lenny fought in Vietnam  only to be gunned down a few blocks from our home. Jesus. I grew up with a crack house across the street. Yeah  I'm a poor black child from the ghetto. These things make me different from you. But the things we have in common set me apart from most of the people in my community  and I am in between these two worlds with enough of my heart to fight for justice in the other. So how did things get so different for us  In the late '  s  my dad    a Pullman porter  son of a slave    bought a house in the Hunts Point section of the South Bronx  and a few years later  he married my mom. At the time  the community was a mostly white  working class neighborhood. My dad was not alone. And as others like him pursued their own version of the American dream  white flight became common in the South Bronx and in many cities around the country. Red lining was used by banks  wherein certain sections of the city  including ours  were deemed off limits to any sort of investment. Many landlords believed it was more profitable to torch their buildings and collect insurance money rather than to sell under those conditions    dead or injured former tenants notwithstanding. Hunts Point was formerly a walk to work community  but now residents had neither work nor home to walk to. A national highway construction boom was added to our problems. In New York State  Robert Moses spearheaded an aggressive highway expansion campaign. One of its primary goals was to make it easier for residents of wealthy communities in Westchester County to go to Manhattan. The South Bronx  which lies in between  did not stand a chance. Residents were often given less than a month's notice before their buildings were razed.         people were displaced. The common perception was that only pimps and pushers and prostitutes were from the South Bronx. And if you are told from your earliest days that nothing good is going to come from your community  that it's bad and ugly  how could it not reflect on you  So now  my family's property was worthless  save for that it was our home  and all we had. And luckily for me  that home and the love inside of it  along with help from teachers  mentors and friends along the way  was enough. Now  why is this story important  Because from a planning perspective  economic degradation begets environmental degradation  which begets social degradation. The disinvestment that began in the     s set the stage for all the environmental injustices that were to come. Antiquated zoning and land use regulations are still used to this day to continue putting polluting facilities in my neighborhood. Are these factors taken into consideration when land use policy is decided  What costs are associated with these decisions  And who pays  Who profits  Does anything justify what the local community goes through  This was  planning     in quotes    that did not have our best interests in mind. Once we realized that  we decided it was time to do our own planning. That small park I told you about earlier was the first stage of building a Greenway movement in the South Bronx. I wrote a one and a quarter million dollar federal transportation grant to design the plan for a waterfront esplanade with dedicated on street bike paths. Physical improvements help inform public policy regarding traffic safety  the placement of the waste and other facilities  which  if done properly  don't compromise a community's quality of life. They provide opportunities to be more physically active  as well as local economic development. Think bike shops  juice stands. We secured    million dollars to build first phase projects. This is Lafayette Avenue    and that's redesigned by Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects. And once this path is constructed  it'll connect the South Bronx with more than     acres of Randall's Island Park. Right now we're separated by about    feet of water  but this link will change that. As we nurture the natural environment  its abundance will give us back even more. We run a project called the Bronx  Environmental  Stewardship Training  which provides job training in the fields of ecological restoration  so that folks from our community have the skills to compete for these well paying jobs. Little by little  we're seeding the area with green collar jobs    and with people that have both a financial and personal stake in their environment. The Sheridan Expressway is an underutilized relic of the Robert Moses era  built with no regard for the neighborhoods that were divided by it. Even during rush hour  it goes virtually unused. The community created an alternative transportation plan that allows for the removal of the highway. We have the opportunity now to bring together all the stakeholders to re envision how this    acres can be better utilized for parkland  affordable housing and local economic development. We also built New York City's first green and cool roof demonstration project on top of our offices. Cool roofs are highly reflective surfaces that don't absorb solar heat  and pass it on to the building or atmosphere. Green roofs are soil and living plants. Both can be used instead of petroleum based roofing materials that absorb heat  contribute to urban  heat island  effect and degrade under the sun  which we in turn breathe. Green roofs also retain up to    percent of rainfall  so they reduce a city's need to fund costly end of pipe solutions    which  incidentally  are often located in environmental justice communities like mine. And they provide habitats for our little friends   Butterfly  So cool  Anyway  the demonstration project is a springboard for our own green roof installation business  bringing jobs and sustainable economic activity to the South Bronx.  Green is the new black ...  I like that  too. Anyway  I know Chris told us not to do pitches up here  but since I have all of your attention  We need investors. End of pitch. It's better to ask for forgiveness than permission. Anyway    OK. Katrina. Prior to Katrina  the South Bronx and New Orleans' Ninth Ward had a lot in common. Both were largely populated by poor people of color  both hotbeds of cultural innovation  think hip hop and jazz. Both are waterfront communities that host both industries and residents in close proximity of one another. In the post Katrina era  we have still more in common. We're at best ignored  and maligned and abused  at worst  by negligent regulatory agencies  pernicious zoning and lax governmental accountability. Neither the destruction of the Ninth Ward nor the South Bronx was inevitable. But we have emerged with valuable lessons about how to dig ourselves out. We are more than simply national symbols of urban blight or problems to be solved by empty campaign promises of presidents come and gone. Now will we let the Gulf Coast languish for a decade or two  like the South Bronx did  Or will we take proactive steps and learn from the homegrown resource of grassroots activists that have been born of desperation in communities like mine  Now listen  I do not expect individuals  corporations or government to make the world a better place because it is right or moral. This presentation today only represents some of what I've been through. Like a tiny little bit. You've no clue. But I'll tell you later  if you want to know. But    I know it's the bottom line  or one's perception of it  that motivates people in the end. I'm interested in what I like to call the  triple bottom line  that sustainable development can produce. Developments that have the potential to create positive returns for all concerned  the developers  government and the community where these projects go up. At present  that's not happening in New York City. And we are operating with a comprehensive urban planning deficit. A parade of government subsidies is going to propose big box and stadium developments in the South Bronx  but there is scant coordination between city agencies on how to deal with the cumulative effects of increased traffic  pollution  solid waste and the impacts on open space. And their approaches to local economic and job development are so lame it's not even funny. Because on top of that  the world's richest sports team is replacing the House That Ruth Built by destroying two well loved community parks. Now  we'll have even less than that stat I told you about earlier. And although less than    percent of South Bronx residents own cars  these projects include thousands of new parking spaces  yet zip in terms of mass public transit. Now  what's missing from the larger debate is a comprehensive cost benefit analysis between not fixing an unhealthy  environmentally challenged community  versus incorporating structural  sustainable changes. My agency is working closely with Columbia University and others to shine a light on these issues. Now let's get this straight  I am not anti development. Ours is a city  not a wilderness preserve. And I've embraced my inner capitalist. And  but I don't have    You probably all have  and if you haven't  you need to. So I don't have a problem with developers making money. There's enough precedent out there to show that a sustainable  community friendly development can still make a fortune. Fellow TEDsters Bill McDonough and Amory Lovins    both heroes of mine by the way    have shown that you can actually do that. I do have a problem with developments that hyper exploit politically vulnerable communities for profit. That it continues is a shame upon us all  because we are all responsible for the future that we create. But one of the things I do to remind myself of greater possibilities  is to learn from visionaries in other cities. This is my version of globalization. Let's take Bogota. Poor  Latino  surrounded by runaway gun violence and drug trafficking  a reputation not unlike that of the South Bronx. However  this city was blessed in the late     s with a highly influential mayor named Enrique Pe alosa. He looked at the demographics. Few Bogotanos own cars  yet a huge portion of the city's resources was dedicated to serving them. If you're a mayor  you can do something about that. His administration narrowed key municipal thoroughfares from five lanes to three  outlawed parking on those streets  expanded pedestrian walkways and bike lanes  created public plazas  created one of the most efficient bus mass transit systems in the entire world. For his brilliant efforts  he was nearly impeached. But as people began to see that they were being put first on issues reflecting their day to day lives  incredible things happened. People stopped littering. Crime rates dropped  because the streets were alive with people. His administration attacked several typical urban problems at one time  and on a third world budget  at that. We have no excuse in this country  I'm sorry. But the bottom line is  their people first agenda was not meant to penalize those who could actually afford cars  but rather  to provide opportunities for all Bogotanos to participate in the city's resurgence. That development should not come at the expense of the majority of the population is still considered a radical idea here in the U.S. But Bogota's example has the power to change that. You  however  are blessed with the gift of influence. That's why you're here and why you value the information we exchange. Use your influence in support of comprehensive  sustainable change everywhere. Don't just talk about it at TED. This is a nationwide policy agenda I'm trying to build  and as you all know  politics are personal. Help me make green the new black. Help me make sustainability sexy. Make it a part of your dinner and cocktail conversations. Help me fight for environmental and economic justice. Support investments with a triple bottom line return. Help me democratize sustainability by bringing everyone to the table  and insisting that comprehensive planning can be addressed everywhere. Oh good  glad I have a little more time  Listen    when I spoke to Mr. Gore the other day after breakfast  I asked him how environmental justice activists were going to be included in his new marketing strategy. His response was a grant program. I don't think he understood that I wasn't asking for funding. I was making him an offer. What troubled me was that this top down approach is still around. Now  don't get me wrong  we need money. But grassroots groups are needed at the table during the decision making process. Of the    percent of the energy that Mr. Gore reminded us that we waste every day  don't add wasting our energy  intelligence and hard earned experience to that count. I have come from so far to meet you like this. Please don't waste me. By working together  we can become one of those small  rapidly growing groups of individuals who actually have the audacity and courage to believe that we actually can change the world. We might have come to this conference from very  very different stations in life  but believe me  we all share one incredibly powerful thing. We have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Ciao  bellos  Good morning. How are you  It's been great  hasn't it  I've been blown away by the whole thing. In fact  I'm leaving. There have been three themes running through the conference which are relevant to what I want to talk about. One is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that we've had and in all of the people here. Just the variety of it and the range of it. The second is that it's put us in a place where we have no idea what's going to happen  in terms of the future. No idea how this may play out. I have an interest in education. Actually  what I find is everybody has an interest in education. Don't you  I find this very interesting. If you're at a dinner party  and you say you work in education    Actually  you're not often at dinner parties  frankly. If you work in education  you're not asked. And you're never asked back  curiously. That's strange to me. But if you are  and you say to somebody  you know  they say   What do you do   and you say you work in education  you can see the blood run from their face. They're like   Oh my God   you know   Why me    My one night out all week.  But if you ask about their education  they pin you to the wall. Because it's one of those things that goes deep with people  am I right  Like religion  and money and other things. So I have a big interest in education  and I think we all do. We have a huge vested interest in it  partly because it's education that's meant to take us into this future that we can't grasp. If you think of it  children starting school this year will be retiring in     . Nobody has a clue  despite all the expertise that's been on parade for the past four days  what the world will look like in five years' time. And yet we're meant to be educating them for it. So the unpredictability  I think  is extraordinary. And the third part of this is that we've all agreed  nonetheless  on the really extraordinary capacities that children have    their capacities for innovation. I mean  Sirena last night was a marvel  wasn't she  Just seeing what she could do. And she's exceptional  but I think she's not  so to speak  exceptional in the whole of childhood. What you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent. And my contention is  all kids have tremendous talents. And we squander them  pretty ruthlessly. So I want to talk about education and I want to talk about creativity. My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy  and we should treat it with the same status. That was it  by the way. Thank you very much. So     minutes left. Well  I was born... no. I heard a great story recently    I love telling it    of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson. She was six  and she was at the back  drawing  and the teacher said this girl hardly ever paid attention  and in this drawing lesson  she did. The teacher was fascinated. She went over to her  and she said   What are you drawing   And the girl said   I'm drawing a picture of God.  And the teacher said   But nobody knows what God looks like.  And the girl said   They will  in a minute.  When my son was four in England    Actually  he was four everywhere  to be honest. If we're being strict about it  wherever he went  he was four that year. He was in the Nativity play. Do you remember the story  No  it was big  it was a big story. Mel Gibson did the sequel  you may have seen it.  Nativity II.  But James got the part of Joseph  which we were thrilled about. We considered this to be one of the lead parts. We had the place crammed full of agents in T shirts   James Robinson IS Joseph    Laughter  He didn't have to speak  but you know the bit where the three kings come in  They come in bearing gifts  gold  frankincense and myrrh. This really happened. We were sitting there and I think they just went out of sequence  because we talked to the little boy afterward and we said   You OK with that   And he said   Yeah  why  Was that wrong   They just switched. The three boys came in  four year olds with tea towels on their heads  and they put these boxes down  and the first boy said   I bring you gold.  And the second boy said   I bring you myrrh.  And the third boy said   Frank sent this.  What these things have in common is that kids will take a chance. If they don't know  they'll have a go. Am I right  They're not frightened of being wrong. I don't mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative. What we do know is  if you're not prepared to be wrong  you'll never come up with anything original    if you're not prepared to be wrong. And by the time they get to be adults  most kids have lost that capacity. They have become frightened of being wrong. And we run our companies like this. We stigmatize mistakes. And we're now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make. And the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities. Picasso once said this  he said that all children are born artists. The problem is to remain an artist as we grow up. I believe this passionately  that we don't grow into creativity  we grow out of it. Or rather  we get educated out of it. So why is this  I lived in Stratford on Avon until about five years ago. In fact  we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles. So you can imagine what a seamless transition that was. Actually  we lived in a place called Snitterfield  just outside Stratford  which is where Shakespeare's father was born. Are you struck by a new thought  I was. You don't think of Shakespeare having a father  do you  Do you  Because you don't think of Shakespeare being a child  do you  Shakespeare being seven  I never thought of it. I mean  he was seven at some point. He was in somebody's English class  wasn't he  How annoying would that be   Must try harder.  Being sent to bed by his dad  you know  to Shakespeare   Go to bed  now  And put the pencil down.   And stop speaking like that.   It's confusing everybody.  Anyway  we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles  and I just want to say a word about the transition. My son didn't want to come. I've got two kids  he's    now  my daughter's   . He didn't want to come to Los Angeles. He loved it  but he had a girlfriend in England. This was the love of his life  Sarah. He'd known her for a month. Mind you  they'd had their fourth anniversary  because it's a long time when you're   . He was really upset on the plane  he said   I'll never find another girl like Sarah.  And we were rather pleased about that  frankly    Because she was the main reason we were leaving the country. But something strikes you when you move to America and travel around the world  Every education system on Earth has the same hierarchy of subjects. Every one. Doesn't matter where you go. You'd think it would be otherwise  but it isn't. At the top are mathematics and languages  then the humanities  and at the bottom are the arts. Everywhere on Earth. And in pretty much every system too  there's a hierarchy within the arts. Art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance. There isn't an education system on the planet that teaches dance everyday to children the way we teach them mathematics. Why  Why not  I think this is rather important. I think math is very important  but so is dance. Children dance all the time if they're allowed to  we all do. We all have bodies  don't we  Did I miss a meeting  Truthfully  what happens is  as children grow up  we start to educate them progressively from the waist up. And then we focus on their heads. And slightly to one side. If you were to visit education  as an alien  and say  What's it for  public education   I think you'd have to conclude  if you look at the output  who really succeeds by this  who does everything that they should  who gets all the brownie points  who are the winners    I think you'd have to conclude the whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors. Isn't it  They're the people who come out the top. And I used to be one  so there. And I like university professors  but you know  we shouldn't hold them up as the high water mark of all human achievement. They're just a form of life  another form of life. But they're rather curious  and I say this out of affection for them. There's something curious about professors in my experience    not all of them  but typically  they live in their heads. They live up there  and slightly to one side. They're disembodied  you know  in a kind of literal way. They look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads. Don't they  It's a way of getting their head to meetings. If you want real evidence of out of body experiences  get yourself along to a residential conference of senior academics  and pop into the discotheque on the final night. And there  you will see it. Grown men and women writhing uncontrollably  off the beat. Waiting until it ends so they can go home and write a paper about it. Our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability. And there's a reason. Around the world  there were no public systems of education  really  before the   th century. They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism. So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas. Number one  that the most useful subjects for work are at the top. So you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kid  things you liked  on the grounds that you would never get a job doing that. Is that right  Don't do music  you're not going to be a musician  don't do art  you won't be an artist. Benign advice    now  profoundly mistaken. The whole world is engulfed in a revolution. And the second is academic ability  which has really come to dominate our view of intelligence  because the universities designed the system in their image. If you think of it  the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance. And the consequence is that many highly talented  brilliant  creative people think they're not  because the thing they were good at at school wasn't valued  or was actually stigmatized. And I think we can't afford to go on that way. In the next    years  according to UNESCO  more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of history. More people  and it's the combination of all the things we've talked about    technology and its transformation effect on work  and demography and the huge explosion in population. Suddenly  degrees aren't worth anything. Isn't that true  When I was a student  if you had a degree  you had a job. If you didn't have a job  it's because you didn't want one. And I didn't want one  frankly.  Laughter  But now kids with degrees are often heading home to carry on playing video games  because you need an MA where the previous job required a BA  and now you need a PhD for the other. It's a process of academic inflation. And it indicates the whole structure of education is shifting beneath our feet. We need to radically rethink our view of intelligence. We know three things about intelligence. One  it's diverse. We think about the world in all the ways that we experience it. We think visually  we think in sound  we think kinesthetically. We think in abstract terms  we think in movement. Secondly  intelligence is dynamic. If you look at the interactions of a human brain  as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations  intelligence is wonderfully interactive. The brain isn't divided into compartments. In fact  creativity    which I define as the process of having original ideas that have value    more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things. By the way  there's a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain called the corpus callosum. It's thicker in women. Following off from Helen yesterday  this is probably why women are better at multi tasking. Because you are  aren't you  There's a raft of research  but I know it from my personal life. If my wife is cooking a meal at home    which is not often  thankfully. No  she's good at some things  but if she's cooking  she's dealing with people on the phone  she's talking to the kids  she's painting the ceiling  she's doing open heart surgery over here. If I'm cooking  the door is shut  the kids are out  the phone's on the hook  if she comes in I get annoyed. I say   Terry  please  I'm trying to fry an egg in here.   Give me a break.  Actually  do you know that old philosophical thing  if a tree falls in a forest and nobody hears it  did it happen  Remember that old chestnut  I saw a great t shirt recently  which said   If a man speaks his mind in a forest  and no woman hears him  is he still wrong   And the third thing about intelligence is  it's distinct. I'm doing a new book at the moment called  Epiphany   which is based on a series of interviews with people about how they discovered their talent. I'm fascinated by how people got to be there. It's really prompted by a conversation I had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have never heard of  Gillian Lynne. Have you heard of her  Some have. She's a choreographer  and everybody knows her work. She did  Cats  and  Phantom of the Opera.  She's wonderful. I used to be on the board of The Royal Ballet  as you can see. Anyway  Gillian and I had lunch one day and I said   How did you get to be a dancer   It was interesting. When she was at school  she was really hopeless. And the school  in the '  s  wrote to her parents and said   We think Gillian has a learning disorder.  She couldn't concentrate  she was fidgeting. I think now they'd say she had ADHD. Wouldn't you  But this was the     s  and ADHD hadn't been invented at this point. It wasn't an available condition. People weren't aware they could have that. Anyway  she went to see this specialist. So  this oak paneled room  and she was there with her mother  and she was led and sat on this chair at the end  and she sat on her hands for    minutes while this man talked to her mother about the problems Gillian was having at school. Because she was disturbing people  her homework was always late  and so on  little kid of eight. In the end  the doctor went and sat next to Gillian  and said   I've listened to all these things your mother's told me  I need to speak to her privately. Wait here. We'll be back  we won't be very long   and they went and left her. But as they went out of the room  he turned on the radio that was sitting on his desk. And when they got out  he said to her mother   Just stand and watch her.  And the minute they left the room  she was on her feet  moving to the music. And they watched for a few minutes and he turned to her mother and said   Mrs. Lynne  Gillian isn't sick  she's a dancer. Take her to a dance school.  I said   What happened   She said   She did. I can't tell you how wonderful it was. We walked in this room and it was full of people like me. People who couldn't sit still. People who had to move to think.  Who had to move to think. They did ballet  they did tap  jazz  they did modern  they did contemporary. She was eventually auditioned for the Royal Ballet School  she became a soloist  she had a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet. She eventually graduated from the Royal Ballet School  founded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company  met Andrew Lloyd Webber. She's been responsible for some of the most successful musical theater productions in history  she's given pleasure to millions  and she's a multi millionaire. Somebody else might have put her on medication and told her to calm down. What I think it comes to is this  Al Gore spoke the other night about ecology and the revolution that was triggered by Rachel Carson. I believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception of human ecology  one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity. Our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip mine the earth  for a particular commodity. And for the future  it won't serve us. We have to rethink the fundamental principles on which we're educating our children. There was a wonderful quote by Jonas Salk  who said   If all the insects were to disappear from the Earth  within    years all life on Earth would end. If all human beings disappeared from the Earth  within    years all forms of life would flourish.  And he's right. What TED celebrates is the gift of the human imagination. We have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely and that we avert some of the scenarios that we've talked about. And the only way we'll do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are. And our task is to educate their whole being  so they can face this future. By the way    we may not see this future  but they will. And our job is to help them make something of it. Thank you very much. About    years ago  I took on the task to teach global development to Swedish undergraduate students. That was after having spent about    years together with African institutions studying hunger in Africa  so I was sort of expected to know a little about the world. And I started in our medical university  Karolinska Institute  an undergraduate course called Global Health. But when you get that opportunity  you get a little nervous. I thought  these students coming to us actually have the highest grade you can get in Swedish college systems    so I thought  maybe they know everything I'm going to teach them about. So I did a pre test when they came. And one of the questions from which I learned a lot was this one   Which country has the highest child mortality of these five pairs   I put them together  so that in each pair of country  one has twice the child mortality of the other. And this means that it's much bigger a difference than the uncertainty of the data. I won't put you at a test here  but it's Turkey  which is highest there  Poland  Russia  Pakistan and South Africa. And these were the results of the Swedish students. I did it so I got the confidence interval  which is pretty narrow  and I got happy  of course  a  .  right answer out of five possible. That means that there was a place for a professor of international health and for my course. But one late night  when I was compiling the report  I really realized my discovery. I have shown that Swedish top students know statistically significantly less about the world than the chimpanzees. Because the chimpanzee would score half right if I gave them two bananas with Sri Lanka and Turkey. They would be right half of the cases. But the students are not there. The problem for me was not ignorance  it was preconceived ideas. I did also an unethical study of the professors of the Karolinska Institute  that hands out the Nobel Prize in Medicine  and they are on par with the chimpanzee there. This is where I realized that there was really a need to communicate  because the data of what's happening in the world and the child health of every country is very well aware. We did this software which displays it like this  every bubble here is a country. This country over here is China. This is India. The size of the bubble is the population  and on this axis here  I put fertility rate. Because my students  what they said when they looked upon the world  and I asked them   What do you really think about the world   Well  I first discovered that the textbook was Tintin  mainly. And they said   The world is still 'we' and 'them.' And 'we' is Western world and 'them' is Third World.   And what do you mean with Western world   I said.  Well  that's long life and small family  and Third World is short life and large family.  So this is what I could display here. I put fertility rate here  number of children per woman  one  two  three  four  up to about eight children per woman. We have very good data since              about    on the size of families in all countries. The error margin is narrow. Here  I put life expectancy at birth  from    years in some countries up to about    years. And       there was really a group of countries here that was industrialized countries  and they had small families and long lives. And these were the developing countries  they had large families and they had relatively short lives. Now  what has happened since       We want to see the change. Are the students right  Is it still two types of countries  Or have these developing countries got smaller families and they live here  Or have they got longer lives and live up there  Let's see. We stopped the world then. This is all U.N. statistics that have been available. Here we go. Can you see there  It's China there  moving against better health there  improving there. All the green Latin American countries are moving towards smaller families. Your yellow ones here are the Arabic countries  and they get longer life  but not larger families. The Africans are the green here. They still remain here. This is India  Indonesia is moving on pretty fast. In the '  s here  you have Bangladesh still among the African countries. But now  Bangladesh    it's a miracle that happens in the '  s  the imams start to promote family planning. They move up into that corner. And in the '  s  we have the terrible HIV epidemic that takes down the life expectancy of the African countries and all the rest of them move up into the corner  where we have long lives and small family  and we have a completely new world. Let me make a comparison directly between the United States of America and Vietnam.     . America had small families and long life  Vietnam had large families and short lives. And this is what happens  the data during the war indicate that even with all the death  there was an improvement of life expectancy. By the end of the year  the family planning started in Vietnam  they went for smaller families. And the United States up there is getting for longer life  keeping family size. And in the '  s now  they give up Communist planning and they go for market economy  and it moves faster even than social life. And today  we have in Vietnam the same life expectancy and the same family size here in Vietnam        as in United States        by the end of the war. If we don't look in the data  I think we all underestimate the tremendous change in Asia  which was in social change before we saw the economical change. Let's move over to another way here in which we could display the distribution in the world of the income. This is the world distribution of income of people. One dollar     dollars or     dollars per day. There's no gap between rich and poor any longer. This is a myth. There's a little hump here. But there are people all the way. And if we look where the income ends up  this is     percent the world's annual income. And the richest    percent  they take out of that about    percent. And the poorest    percent  they take about two percent. And this shows that the concept of developing countries is extremely doubtful. We think about aid  like these people here giving aid to these people here. But in the middle  we have most of the world population  and they have now    percent of the income. We heard it in other forms. And who are these  Where are the different countries  I can show you Africa. This is Africa.     the world population  most in poverty. This is OECD. The rich country. The country club of the U.N. And they are over here on this side. Quite an overlap between Africa and OECD. And this is Latin America. It has everything on this Earth  from the poorest to the richest in Latin America. And on top of that  we can put East Europe  we can put East Asia  and we put South Asia. And how did it look like if we go back in time  to about       Then there was more of a hump. And we have most who lived in absolute poverty were Asians. The problem in the world was the poverty in Asia. And if I now let the world move forward  you will see that while population increases  there are hundreds of millions in Asia getting out of poverty and some others getting into poverty  and this is the pattern we have today. And the best projection from the World Bank is that this will happen  and we will not have a divided world. We'll have most people in the middle. Of course it's a logarithmic scale here  but our concept of economy is growth with percent. We look upon it as a possibility of percentile increase. If I change this  and take GDP per capita instead of family income  and I turn these individual data into regional data of gross domestic product  and I take the regions down here  the size of the bubble is still the population. And you have the OECD there  and you have sub Saharan Africa there  and we take off the Arab states there  coming both from Africa and from Asia  and we put them separately  and we can expand this axis  and I can give it a new dimension here  by adding the social values there  child survival. Now I have money on that axis  and I have the possibility of children to survive there. In some countries    .   of children survive to five years of age  others  only   . And here  it seems  there is a gap between OECD  Latin America  East Europe  East Asia  Arab states  South Asia and sub Saharan Africa. The linearity is very strong between child survival and money. But let me split sub Saharan Africa. Health is there and better health is up there. I can go here and I can split sub Saharan Africa into its countries. And when it burst  the size of its country bubble is the size of the population. Sierra Leone down there. Mauritius is up there. Mauritius was the first country to get away with trade barriers  and they could sell their sugar    they could sell their textiles    on equal terms as the people in Europe and North America. There's a huge difference between Africa. And Ghana is here in the middle. In Sierra Leone  humanitarian aid. Here in Uganda  development aid. Here  time to invest  there  you can go for a holiday. It's a tremendous variation within Africa which we rarely often make    that it's equal everything. I can split South Asia here. India's the big bubble in the middle. But a huge difference between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. I can split Arab states. How are they  Same climate  same culture  same religion    huge difference. Even between neighbors. Yemen  civil war. United Arab Emirates  money  which was quite equally and well used. Not as the myth is. And that includes all the children of the foreign workers who are in the country. Data is often better than you think. Many people say data is bad. There is an uncertainty margin  but we can see the difference here  Cambodia  Singapore. The differences are much bigger than the weakness of the data. East Europe  Soviet economy for a long time  but they come out after    years very  very differently. And there is Latin America. Today  we don't have to go to Cuba to find a healthy country in Latin America. Chile will have a lower child mortality than Cuba within some few years from now. Here  we have high income countries in the OECD. And we get the whole pattern here of the world  which is more or less like this. And if we look at it  how the world looks  in       it starts to move. This is Mao Tse tung. He brought health to China. And then he died. And then Deng Xiaoping came and brought money to China  and brought them into the mainstream again. And we have seen how countries move in different directions like this  so it's sort of difficult to get an example country which shows the pattern of the world. But I would like to bring you back to about here  at     . I would like to compare South Korea  which is this one  with Brazil  which is this one. The label went away for me here. And I would like to compare Uganda  which is there. And I can run it forward  like this. And you can see how South Korea is making a very  very fast advancement  whereas Brazil is much slower. And if we move back again  here  and we put on trails on them  like this  you can see again that the speed of development is very  very different  and the countries are moving more or less in the same rate as money and health  but it seems you can move much faster if you are healthy first than if you are wealthy first. And to show that  you can put on the way of United Arab Emirates. They came from here  a mineral country. They cached all the oil  they got all the money  but health cannot be bought at the supermarket. You have to invest in health. You have to get kids into schooling. You have to train health staff. You have to educate the population. And Sheikh Zayed did that in a fairly good way. In spite of falling oil prices  he brought this country up here. So we've got a much more mainstream appearance of the world  where all countries tend to use their money better than they used in the past. Now  this is  more or less  if you look at the average data of the countries    they are like this. Now that's dangerous  to use average data  because there is such a lot of difference within countries. So if I go and look here  we can see that Uganda today is where South Korea was in     . If I split Uganda  there's quite a difference within Uganda. These are the quintiles of Uganda. The richest    percent of Ugandans are there. The poorest are down there. If I split South Africa  it's like this. And if I go down and look at Niger  where there was such a terrible famine  lastly  it's like this. The    percent poorest of Niger is out here  and the    percent richest of South Africa is there  and yet we tend to discuss on what solutions there should be in Africa. Everything in this world exists in Africa. And you can't discuss universal access to HIV  medicine  for that quintile up here with the same strategy as down here. The improvement of the world must be highly contextualized  and it's not relevant to have it on regional level. We must be much more detailed. We find that students get very excited when they can use this. And even more  policy makers and the corporate sectors would like to see how the world is changing. Now  why doesn't this take place  Why are we not using the data we have  We have data in the United Nations  in the national statistical agencies and in universities and other non governmental organizations. Because the data is hidden down in the databases. And the public is there  and the Internet is there  but we have still not used it effectively. All that information we saw changing in the world does not include publicly funded statistics. There are some web pages like this  you know  but they take some nourishment down from the databases  but people put prices on them  stupid passwords and boring statistics. And this won't work. So what is needed  We have the databases. It's not the new database you need. We have wonderful design tools  and more and more are added up here. So we started a nonprofit venture which  linking data to design  we called Gapminder  from the London Underground  where they warn you   mind the gap.  So we thought Gapminder was appropriate. And we started to write software which could link the data like this. And it wasn't that difficult. It took some person years  and we have produced animations. You can take a data set and put it there. We are liberating U.N. data  some few U.N. organization. Some countries accept that their databases can go out on the world  but what we really need is  of course  a search function. A search function where we can copy the data up to a searchable format and get it out in the world. And what do we hear when we go around  I've done anthropology on the main statistical units. Everyone says   It's impossible. This can't be done. Our information is so peculiar in detail  so that cannot be searched as others can be searched. We cannot give the data free to the students  free to the entrepreneurs of the world.  But this is what we would like to see  isn't it  The publicly funded data is down here. And we would like flowers to grow out on the Net. And one of the crucial points is to make them searchable  and then people can use the different design tool to animate it there. And I have pretty good news for you. I have good news that the present  new Head of U.N. Statistics  he doesn't say it's impossible. He only says   We can't do it.  And that's a quite clever guy  huh  So we can see a lot happening in data in the coming years. We will be able to look at income distributions in completely new ways. This is the income distribution of China      . This is the income distribution of the United States      . Almost no overlap. And what has happened  What has happened is this  that China is growing  it's not so equal any longer  and it's appearing here  overlooking the United States. Almost like a ghost  isn't it  It's pretty scary. But I think it's very important to have all this information. We need really to see it. And instead of looking at this  I would like to end up by showing the Internet users per      . In this software  we access about     variables from all the countries quite easily. It takes some time to change for this  but on the axises  you can quite easily get any variable you would like to have. And the thing would be to get up the databases free  to get them searchable  and with a second click  to get them into the graphic formats  where you can instantly understand them. Now  statisticians don't like it  because they say that this will not show the reality  we have to have statistical  analytical methods. But this is hypothesis generating. I end now with the world. There  the Internet is coming. The number of Internet users are going up like this. This is the GDP per capita. And it's a new technology coming in  but then amazingly  how well it fits to the economy of the countries. That's why the      computer will be so important. But it's a nice tendency. It's as if the world is flattening off  isn't it  These countries are lifting more than the economy and will be very interesting to follow this over the year  as I would like you to be able to do with all the publicly funded data. Thank you very much. Thank you. I have to tell you I'm both challenged and excited. My excitement is  I get a chance to give something back. My challenge is  the shortest seminar I usually do is    hours. I'm not exaggerating. I do weekends    I do more  obviously  I also coach people    but I'm into immersion  because how did you learn language  Not just by learning principles  you got in it and you did it so often that it became real. The bottom line of why I'm here  besides being a crazy mofo  is that    I'm not here to motivate you  you don't need that  obviously. Often that's what people think I do  and it's the furthest thing from it. What happens  though  is people say to me   I don't need any motivation.  But that's not what I do. I'm the  why  guy. I want to know why you do what you do. What is your motive for action  What is it that drives you in your life today  Not    years ago. Are you running the same pattern  Because I believe that the invisible force of internal drive  activated  is the most important thing. I'm here because I believe emotion is the force of life. All of us here have great minds. Most of us here have great minds  right  We all know how to think. With our minds we can rationalize anything. We can make anything happen. I agree with what was described a few days ago  that people work in their self interest. But we know that that's bullshit at times. You don't work in your self interest all the time  because when emotion comes into it  the wiring changes in the way it functions. So it's wonderful to think intellectually about how the life of the world is  especially those who are very smart can play this game in our head. But I really want to know what's driving you. What I would like to invite you to do by the end of this talk is explore where you are today  for two reasons. One  so that you can contribute more. And two  that hopefully we can not just understand other people more  but appreciate them more  and create the kinds of connections that can stop some of the challenges that we face today. They're only going to get magnified by the very technology that connects us  because it's making us intersect. That intersection doesn't always create a view of  everybody now understands everybody  and everybody appreciates everybody.  I've had an obsession basically for    years   What makes the difference in the quality of people's lives  What in their performance   I got hired to produce the result now. I've done it for    years. I get the phone call when the athlete is burning down on national television  and they were ahead by five strokes and now they can't get back on the course. I've got to do something right now or nothing matters. I get the phone call when the child is going to commit suicide  I've got to do something. In    years  I'm very grateful to tell you I've never lost one. It doesn't mean I won't some day  but I haven't yet. The reason is an understanding of these human needs. When I get those calls about performance  that's one thing. How do you make a change  I'm also looking to see what is shaping the person's ability to contribute  to do something beyond themselves. Maybe the real question is  I look at life and say there's two master lessons. One is  there's the science of achievement  which almost everyone here has mastered amazingly.  How do you take the invisible and make it visible   How do you make your dreams happen  Your business  your contribution to society  money    whatever  your body  your family. The other lesson that is rarely mastered is the art of fulfillment. Because science is easy  right  We know the rules  you write the code and you get the results. Once you know the game  you just up the ante  don't you  But when it comes to fulfillment    that's an art. The reason is  it's about appreciation and contribution. You can only feel so much by yourself. I've had an interesting laboratory to try to answer the real question how somebody's life changes if you look at them like those people that you've given everything to  Like all the resources they say they need. You gave not a     dollar computer  but the best computer. You gave them love  joy  were there to comfort them. Those people very often    you know some of them    end up the rest of their life with all this love  education  money and background going in and out of rehab. Some people have been through ultimate pain  psychologically  sexually  spiritually  emotionally abused    and not always  but often  they become some of the people that contribute the most to society. The question we've got to ask ourselves really is  what is it  What is it that shapes us  We live in a therapy culture. Most of us don't do that  but the culture's a therapy culture  the mindset that we are our past. And you wouldn't be in this room if you bought that  but most of society thinks biography is destiny. The past equals the future. Of course it does if you live there. But what we know and what we have to remind ourselves    because you can know something intellectually and then not use it  not apply it. We've got to remind ourselves that decision is the ultimate power. When you ask people  have you failed to achieve something significant in your life  Say   Aye.  Audience  Aye. TR  Thanks for the interaction on a high level there. But if you ask people  why didn't you achieve something  Somebody who's working for you  or a partner  or even yourself. When you fail to achieve  what's the reason people say  What do they tell you  Didn't have the knowledge  didn't have the money  didn't have the time  didn't have the technology. I didn't have the right manager. Al Gore  Supreme Court. TR  The Supreme Court. TR  And    What do all those  including the Supreme Court  have in common  They are a claim to you missing resources  and they may be accurate. You may not have the money  or the Supreme Court  but that is not the defining factor. And you correct me if I'm wrong. The defining factor is never resources  it's resourcefulness. And what I mean specifically  rather than just some phrase  is if you have emotion  human emotion  something that I experienced from you the day before yesterday at a level that is as profound as I've ever experienced and I believe with that emotion you would have beat his ass and won. Audience  Yeah  How easy for me to tell him what he should do. Idiot  Robbins. But I know when we watched the debate at that time  there were emotions that blocked people's ability to get this man's intellect and capacity. And the way that it came across to some people on that day    because I know people that wanted to vote in your direction and didn't  and I was upset. But there was emotion there. Do you know what I'm talking about  Say   Aye.  Audience  Aye. TR  So  emotion is it. And if we get the right emotion  we can get ourselves to do anything. If you're creative  playful  fun enough  can you get through to anybody  yes or no  If you don't have the money  but you're creative and determined  you find the way. This is the ultimate resource. But this is not the story that people tell us. They tell us a bunch of different stories. They tell us we don't have the resources  but ultimately  if you take a look here  they say  what are all the reasons they haven't accomplished that  He's broken my pattern  that son of a bitch. But I appreciated the energy  I'll tell you that. What determines your resources  We've said decisions shape destiny  which is my focus here. If decisions shape destiny  what determines it is three decisions. What will you focus on  You have to decide what you're going to focus on. Consciously or unconsciously. the minute you decide to focus  you must give it a meaning  and that meaning produces emotion. Is this the end or the beginning  Is God punishing me or rewarding me  or is this the roll of the dice  An emotion creates what we're going to do  or the action. So  think about your own life  the decisions that have shaped your destiny. And that sounds really heavy  but in the last five or    years  have there been some decisions that if you'd made a different decision  your life would be completely different  How many can think about it  Better or worse. Say   Aye.  Audience  Aye. So the bottom line is  maybe it was where to go to work  and you met the love of your life there  a career decision. I know the Google geniuses I saw here    I mean  I understand that their decision was to sell their technology. What if they made that decision versus to build their own culture  How would the world or their lives be different  their impact  The history of our world is these decisions. When a woman stands up and says   No  I won't go to the back of the bus.  She didn't just affect her life. That decision shaped our culture. Or someone standing in front of a tank. Or being in a position like Lance Armstrong   You've got testicular cancer.  That's pretty tough for any male  especially if you ride a bike. You've got it in your brain  you've got it in your lungs. But what was his decision of what to focus on  Different than most people. What did it mean  It wasn't the end  it was the beginning. He goes off and wins seven championships he never once won before the cancer  because he got emotional fitness  psychological strength. That's the difference in human beings that I've seen of the three million I've been around. In my lab  I've had three million people from    countries over the last    years. And after a while  patterns become obvious. You see that South America and Africa may be connected in a certain way  right  Others say   Oh  that sounds ridiculous.  It's simple. So  what shaped Lance  What shapes you  Two invisible forces. Very quickly. One  state. We all have had times  you did something  and after  you thought to yourself   I can't believe I said or did that  that was so stupid.  Who's been there  Say   Aye.  Audience  Aye. Or after you did something  you go   That was me   It wasn't your ability  it was your state. Your model of the world is what shapes you long term. Your model of the world is the filter. That's what's shaping us. It makes people make decisions. To influence somebody  we need to know what already influences them. It's made up of three parts. First  what's your target  What are you after  It's not your desires. You can get your desires or goals. Who has ever got a goal or desire and thought  is this all there is  Say   Aye.  Audience  Aye. It's needs we have. I believe there are six human needs. Second  once you know what the target that's driving you is and you uncover it for the truth    you don't form it    then you find out what's your map  what's the belief systems that tell you how to get those needs. Some people think the way to get them is to destroy the world  some people  to build  create something  love someone. There's the fuel you pick. So very quickly  six needs. Let me tell you what they are. First one  certainty. These are not goals or desires  these are universal. Everyone needs certainty they can avoid pain and at least be comfortable. Now  how do you get it  Control everybody  Develop a skill  Give up  Smoke a cigarette  And if you got totally certain  ironically  even though we need that    you're not certain about your health  or your children  or money. If you're not sure the ceiling will hold up  you won't listen to any speaker. While we go for certainty differently  if we get total certainty  we get what  What do you feel if you're certain  You know what will happen  when and how it will happen  what would you feel  Bored out of your minds. So  God  in Her infinite wisdom  gave us a second human need  which is uncertainty. We need variety. We need surprise. How many of you here love surprises  Say   Aye.  Audience  Aye. TR  Bullshit. You like the surprises you want. The ones you don't want  you call problems  but you need them. So  variety is important. Have you ever rented a video or a film that you've already seen  Who's done this  Get a fucking life. Why are you doing it  You're certain it's good because you read or saw it before  but you're hoping it's been long enough you've forgotten  and there's variety. Third human need  critical  significance. We all need to feel important  special  unique. You can get it by making more money or being more spiritual. You can do it by getting yourself in a situation where you put more tattoos and earrings in places humans don't want to know. Whatever it takes. The fastest way to do this  if you have no background  no culture  no belief and resources or resourcefulness  is violence. If I put a gun to your head and I live in the 'hood  instantly I'm significant. Zero to   . How high    . How certain am I that you're going to respond to me    . How much uncertainty  Who knows what's going to happen next  Kind of exciting. Like climbing up into a cave and doing that stuff all the way down there. Total variety and uncertainty. And it's significant  isn't it  So you want to risk your life for it. So that's why violence has always been around and will be around unless we have a consciousness change as a species. You can get significance a million ways  but to be significant  you've got to be unique and different. Here's what we really need  connection and love  fourth need. We all want it  most settle for connection  love's too scary. Who here has been hurt in an intimate relationship  If you don't raise your hand  you've had other shit  too. And you're going to get hurt again. Aren't you glad you came to this positive visit  Here's what's true  we need it. We can do it through intimacy  friendship  prayer  through walking in nature. If nothing else works for you  don't get a cat  get a dog  because if you leave for two minutes  it's like you've been gone six months  when you come back   minutes later. These first four needs  every human finds a way to meet. Even if you lie to yourself  you need to have split personalities. I call the first four needs the needs of the personality. The last two are the needs of the spirit. And this is where fulfillment comes. You won't get it from the first four. You'll figure a way  smoke  drink  do whatever  meet the first four. But number five  you must grow. We all know the answer. If you don't grow  you're what  If a relationship or business is not growing  if you're not growing  doesn't matter how much money or friends you have  how many love you  you feel like hell. And I believe the reason we grow is so we have something to give of value. Because the sixth need is to contribute beyond ourselves. Because we all know  corny as that sounds  the secret to living is giving. We all know life is not about me  it's about we. This culture knows that  this room knows that. It's exciting. When you see Nicholas talking about his      computer  the most exciting thing is  here's a genius  but he's got a calling now. You can feel the difference in him  and it's beautiful. And that calling can touch other people. My life was touched because when I was    years old  Thanksgiving  no money  no food  we were not going to starve  but my father was totally messed up  my mom was letting him know how bad he messed up  and somebody came to the door and delivered food. My father made three decisions  I know what they were  briefly. His focus was  This is charity. What does it mean  I'm worthless. What do I have to do  Leave my family   which he did. It was one of the most painful experiences of life. My three decisions gave me a different path. I set focus on  There's food.  What a concept  But this is what changed my life  shaped me as a human being. Somebody's gift  I don't even know who it is. My father always said   No one gives a shit.  And now somebody I don't know  they're not asking for anything  just giving us food  looking out for us. It made me believe this  that strangers care. And that made me decide  if strangers care about me and my family  I care about them. I'm going to do something to make a difference. So when I was     I went out on Thanksgiving  it was my target for years to have enough money to feed two families. The most fun and moving thing I ever did in my life. Next year  I did four  then eight. I didn't tell anybody what I was doing  I wasn't doing it for brownie points. But after eight  I thought I could use some help. So I went out  got my friends involved  then I grew companies  got     and I built the foundation.    years later  I'm proud to tell you last year we fed   million people in    countries through our foundation. All during the holidays  Thanksgiving  Christmas  in different countries around the world. Thank you. I don't tell you that to brag  but because I'm proud of human beings because they get excited to contribute once they've had the chance to experience it  not talk about it. So  finally    I'm about out of time. The target that shapes you    Here's what's different about people. We have the same needs. But are you a certainty freak  is that what you value most  or uncertainty  This man couldn't be a certainty freak if he climbed through those caves. Are you driven by significance or love  We all need all six  but what your lead system is tilts you in a different direction. And as you move in a direction  you have a destination or destiny. The second piece is the map. The operating system tells you how to get there  and some people's map is   I'm going to save lives even if I die for other people   and they're a fireman  and somebody else says   I'm going to kill people to do it.  They're trying to meet the same needs of significance. They want to honor God or honor their family. But they have a different map. And there are seven different beliefs  I can't go through them  because I'm done. The last piece is emotion. One of the parts of the map is like time. Some people's idea of a long time is     years. Somebody else's is three seconds  which is what I have. And the last one I've already mentioned that fell to you. If you've got a target and a map    I can't use Google because I love Macs  and they haven't made it good for Macs yet. So if you use MapQuest    how many have made this fatal mistake of using it  You use this thing and you don't get there. Imagine if your beliefs guarantee you can never get to where you want to go. The last thing is emotion. Here's what I'll tell you about emotion. There are       emotions that we have words for in the English language  which is just a linguistic representation that changes by language. But if your dominant emotions    If I have        people or       and I have them write down all the emotions that they experience in an average week  and I give them as long as they need  and on one side they write empowering emotions  the other's disempowering  guess how many emotions they experience  Less than   . And half of those make them feel like shit. They have six good feelings. Happy  happy  excited  oh shit  frustrated  frustrated  overwhelmed  depressed. How many of you know somebody who  no matter what happens  finds a way to get pissed off  Or no matter what happens  they find a way to be happy or excited. How many of you know somebody like this  When      happened  I'll finish with this  I was in Hawaii. I was with       people from    countries  we were translating four languages simultaneously for a program I was conducting  for a week. The night before was called Emotional Mastery. I got up  had no plan for this  and I said    we had fireworks  I do crazy shit  fun stuff  and at the end  I stopped. I had this plan  but I never know what I'm going to say. And all of a sudden  I said   When do people really start to live  When they face death.  And I went through this whole thing about  if you weren't going to get off this island  if nine days from now  you were going to die  who would you call  what would you say  what would you do  That night is when      happened. One woman had come to the seminar  and when she came there  her previous boyfriend had been kidnapped and murdered. Her new boyfriend wanted to marry her  and she said no. He said   If you go to that Hawaii thing  it's over with us.  She said   It's over.  When I finished that night  she called him and left a message at the top of the World Trade Center where he worked  saying   I love you  I want you to know I want to marry you. It was stupid of me.  She was asleep  because it was   a.m. for us  when he called her back  and said   Honey  I can't tell you what this means. I don't know how to tell you this  but you gave me the greatest gift  because I'm going to die.  And she played the recording for us in the room. She was on Larry King later. And he said   You're probably wondering how on Earth this could happen to you twice. All I can say is this must be God's message to you. From now on  every day  give your all  love your all. Don't let anything ever stop you.  She finishes  and a man stands up  and he says   I'm from Pakistan  I'm a Muslim. I'd love to hold your hand and say I'm sorry  but frankly  this is retribution.  I can't tell you the rest  because I'm out of time. Are you sure     seconds     seconds  I want to be respectful. All I can tell you is  I brought this man on stage with a man from New York who worked in the World Trade Center  because I had about     New Yorkers there. More than    lost their entire companies  friends  marking off their Palm Pilots. One financial trader  woman made of steel  bawling       friends crossing off that all died. And I said   What are we going to focus on  What does this mean and what are we going to do   And I got the group to focus on  if you didn't lose somebody today  your focus is going to be how to serve somebody else. Then one woman stood up and was so angry  screaming and yelling. I found out she wasn't from New York  she's not an American  doesn't know anybody here. I asked   Do you always get angry   She said   Yes.  Guilty people got guilty  sad people got sad. I took these two men and I did an indirect negotiation. Jewish man with family in the occupied territory  someone in New York who would have died if he was at work that day  and this man who wanted to be a terrorist  and I made it very clear. This integration is on a film  which I'd be happy to send you  instead of my verbalization  but the two of them not only came together and changed their beliefs and models of the world  but worked together to bring  for almost four years now  through various mosques and synagogues  the idea of how to create peace. And he wrote a book  called  My Jihad  My Way of Peace.  So  transformation can happen. My invitation to you is  explore your web  the web in here    the needs  the beliefs  the emotions that are controlling you  for two reasons  so there's more of you to give  and achieve  too  but I mean give  because that's what's going to fill you up. And secondly  so you can appreciate    not just understand  that's intellectual  that's the mind  but appreciate what's driving other people. It's the only way our world's going to change. God bless you  thank you. I hope this was of service.
