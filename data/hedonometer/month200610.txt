Thank you. It's really an honor and a privilege to be here spending my last day as a teenager. Today I want to talk to you about the future  but first I'm going to tell you a bit about the past. My story starts way before I was born. My grandmother was on a train to Auschwitz  the death camp. And she was going along the tracks  and the tracks split. And somehow    we don't really know exactly the whole story    but the train took the wrong track and went to a work camp rather than the death camp. My grandmother survived and married my grandfather. They were living in Hungary  and my mother was born. And when my mother was two years old  the Hungarian revolution was raging  and they decided to escape Hungary. They got on a boat  and yet another divergence    the boat was either going to Canada or to Australia. They got on and didn't know where they were going  and ended up in Canada. So  to make a long story short  they came to Canada. My grandmother was a chemist. She worked at the Banting Institute in Toronto  and at    she died of stomach cancer. I never met my grandmother  but I carry on her name    her exact name  Eva Vertes    and I like to think I carry on her scientific passion  too. I found this passion not far from here  actually  when I was nine years old. My family was on a road trip and we were in the Grand Canyon. And I had never been a reader when I was young    my dad had tried me with the Hardy Boys  I tried Nancy Drew  I tried all that    and I just didn't like reading books. And my mother bought this book when we were at the Grand Canyon called  The Hot Zone.  It was all about the outbreak of the Ebola virus. And something about it just kind of drew me towards it. There was this big sort of bumpy looking virus on the cover  and I just wanted to read it. I picked up that book  and as we drove from the edge of the Grand Canyon to Big Sur  and to  actually  here where we are today  in Monterey  I read that book  and from when I was reading that book  I knew that I wanted to have a life in medicine. I wanted to be like the explorers I'd read about in the book  who went into the jungles of Africa  went into the research labs and just tried to figure out what this deadly virus was. So from that moment on  I read every medical book I could get my hands on  and I just loved it so much. I was a passive observer of the medical world. It wasn't until I entered high school that I thought   Maybe now  you know    being a big high school kid    I can maybe become an active part of this big medical world.  I was     and I emailed professors at the local university to see if maybe I could go work in their lab. And hardly anyone responded. But I mean  why would they respond to a    year old  anyway  And I got to go talk to one professor  Dr. Jacobs  who accepted me into the lab. At that time  I was really interested in neuroscience and wanted to do a research project in neurology    specifically looking at the effects of heavy metals on the developing nervous system. So I started that  and worked in his lab for a year  and found the results that I guess you'd expect to find when you feed fruit flies heavy metals    that it really  really impaired the nervous system. The spinal cord had breaks. The neurons were crossing in every which way. And from then I wanted to look not at impairment  but at prevention of impairment. So that's what led me to Alzheimer's. I started reading about Alzheimer's and tried to familiarize myself with the research  and at the same time when I was in the    I was reading in the medical library one day  and I read this article about something called  purine derivatives.  And they seemed to have cell growth promoting properties. And being naive about the whole field  I kind of thought   Oh  you have cell death in Alzheimer's which is causing the memory deficit  and then you have this compound    purine derivatives    that are promoting cell growth.  And so I thought   Maybe if it can promote cell growth  it can inhibit cell death  too.  And so that's the project that I pursued for that year  and it's continuing now as well  and found that a specific purine derivative called  guanidine  had inhibited the cell growth by approximately    percent. So I presented those results at the International Science Fair  which was just one of the most amazing experiences of my life. And there I was awarded  Best in the World in Medicine   which allowed me to get in  or at least get a foot in the door of the big medical world. And from then on  since I was now in this huge exciting world  I wanted to explore it all. I wanted it all at once  but knew I couldn't really get that. And I stumbled across something called  cancer stem cells.  And this is really what I want to talk to you about today    about cancer. At first when I heard of cancer stem cells  I didn't really know how to put the two together. I'd heard of stem cells  and I'd heard of them as the panacea of the future    the therapy of many diseases to come in the future  perhaps. But I'd heard of cancer as the most feared disease of our time  so how did the good and bad go together  Last summer I worked at Stanford University  doing some research on cancer stem cells. And while I was doing this  I was reading the cancer literature  trying to    again    familiarize myself with this new medical field. And it seemed that tumors actually begin from a stem cell. This fascinated me. The more I read  the more I looked at cancer differently and almost became less fearful of it. It seems that cancer is a direct result to injury. If you smoke  you damage your lung tissue  and then lung cancer arises. If you drink  you damage your liver  and then liver cancer occurs. And it was really interesting    there were articles correlating if you have a bone fracture  and then bone cancer arises. Because what stem cells are    they're these phenomenal cells that really have the ability to differentiate into any type of tissue. So  if the body is sensing that you have damage to an organ and then it's initiating cancer  it's almost as if this is a repair response. And the cancer  the body is saying the lung tissue is damaged  we need to repair the lung. And cancer is originating in the lung trying to repair    because you have this excessive proliferation of these remarkable cells that really have the potential to become lung tissue. But it's almost as if the body has originated this ingenious response  but can't quite control it. It hasn't yet become fine tuned enough to finish what has been initiated. So this really  really fascinated me. And I really think that we can't think about cancer    let alone any disease    in such black and white terms. If we eliminate cancer the way we're trying to do now  with chemotherapy and radiation  we're bombarding the body or the cancer with toxins  or with radiation  trying to kill it. It's almost as if we're getting back to this starting point. We're removing the cancer cells  but we're revealing the previous damage that the body has tried to fix. Shouldn't we think about manipulation  rather than elimination  If somehow we can cause these cells to differentiate    to become bone tissue  lung tissue  liver tissue  whatever that cancer has been put there to do    it would be a repair process. We'd end up better than we were before cancer. So  this really changed my view of looking at cancer. And while I was reading all these articles about cancer  it seemed that the articles    a lot of them    focused on  you know  the genetics of breast cancer  and the genesis and the progression of breast cancer    tracking the cancer through the body  tracing where it is  where it goes. But it struck me that I'd never heard of cancer of the heart  or cancer of any skeletal muscle for that matter. And skeletal muscle constitutes    percent of our body  or over    percent of our body. And so at first I kind of thought   Well  maybe there's some obvious explanation why skeletal muscle doesn't get cancer    at least not that I know of.  So  I looked further into it  found as many articles as I could  and it was amazing    because it turned out that it was very rare. Some articles even went as far as to say that skeletal muscle tissue is resistant to cancer  and furthermore  not only to cancer  but of metastases going to skeletal muscle. And what metastases are is when the tumor    when a piece    breaks off and travels through the blood stream and goes to a different organ. That's what a metastasis is. It's the part of cancer that is the most dangerous. If cancer was localized  we could likely remove it  or somehow    you know  it's contained. It's very contained. But once it starts moving throughout the body  that's when it becomes deadly. So the fact that not only did cancer not seem to originate in skeletal muscles  but cancer didn't seem to go to skeletal muscle    there seemed to be something here. So these articles were saying  you know   Skeletal    metastasis to skeletal muscle    is very rare.  But it was left at that. No one seemed to be asking why. So I decided to ask why. At first    the first thing I did was I emailed some professors who specialized in skeletal muscle physiology  and pretty much said   Hey  it seems like cancer doesn't really go to skeletal muscle. Is there a reason for this   And a lot of the replies I got were that muscle is terminally differentiated tissue. Meaning that you have muscle cells  but they're not dividing  so it doesn't seem like a good target for cancer to hijack. But then again  this fact that the metastases didn't go to skeletal muscle made that seem unlikely. And furthermore  that nervous tissue    brain    gets cancer  and brain cells are also terminally differentiated. So I decided to ask why. And here's some of  I guess  my hypotheses that I'll be starting to investigate this May at the Sylvester Cancer Institute in Miami. And I guess I'll keep investigating until I get the answers. But I know that in science  once you get the answers  inevitably you're going to have more questions. So I guess you could say that I'll probably be doing this for the rest of my life. Some of my hypotheses are that when you first think about skeletal muscle  there's a lot of blood vessels going to skeletal muscle. And the first thing that makes me think is that blood vessels are like highways for the tumor cells. Tumor cells can travel through the blood vessels. And you think  the more highways there are in a tissue  the more likely it is to get cancer or to get metastases. So first of all I thought  you know   Wouldn't it be favorable to cancer getting to skeletal muscle   And as well  cancer tumors require a process called angiogenesis  which is really  the tumor recruits the blood vessels to itself to supply itself with nutrients so it can grow. Without angiogenesis  the tumor remains the size of a pinpoint and it's not harmful. So angiogenesis is really a central process to the pathogenesis of cancer. And one article that really stood out to me when I was just reading about this  trying to figure out why cancer doesn't go to skeletal muscle  was that it had reported    percent of micro metastases to skeletal muscle upon autopsy.    percent  Meaning that there were these pinpoint tumors in skeletal muscle  but only .   percent of actual metastases    suggesting that maybe skeletal muscle is able to control the angiogenesis  is able to control the tumors recruiting these blood vessels. We use skeletal muscles so much. It's the one portion of our body    our heart's always beating. We're always moving our muscles. Is it possible that muscle somehow intuitively knows that it needs this blood supply  It needs to be constantly contracting  so therefore it's almost selfish. It's grabbing its blood vessels for itself. Therefore  when a tumor comes into skeletal muscle tissue  it can't get a blood supply  and can't grow. So this suggests that maybe if there is an anti angiogenic factor in skeletal muscle    or perhaps even more  an angiogenic routing factor  so it can actually direct where the blood vessels grow    this could be a potential future therapy for cancer. And another thing that's really interesting is that there's this whole    the way tumors move throughout the body  it's a very complex system    and there's something called the chemokine network. And chemokines are essentially chemical attractants  and they're the stop and go signals for cancer. So a tumor expresses chemokine receptors  and another organ    a distant organ somewhere in the body    will have the corresponding chemokines  and the tumor will see these chemokines and migrate towards it. Is it possible that skeletal muscle doesn't express this type of molecules  And the other really interesting thing is that when skeletal muscle    there's been several reports that when skeletal muscle is injured  that's what correlates with metastases going to skeletal muscle. And  furthermore  when skeletal muscle is injured  that's what causes chemokines    these signals saying   Cancer  you can come to me   the  go signs  for the tumors    it causes them to highly express these chemokines. So  there's so much interplay here. I mean  there are so many possibilities for why tumors don't go to skeletal muscle. But it seems like by investigating  by attacking cancer  by searching where cancer is not  there has got to be something    there's got to be something    that's making this tissue resistant to tumors. And can we utilize    can we take this property  this compound  this receptor  whatever it is that's controlling these anti tumor properties and apply it to cancer therapy in general  Now  one thing that kind of ties the resistance of skeletal muscle to cancer    to the cancer as a repair response gone out of control in the body    is that skeletal muscle has a factor in it called  MyoD.  And what MyoD essentially does is  it causes cells to differentiate into muscle cells. So this compound  MyoD  has been tested on a lot of different cell types and been shown to actually convert this variety of cell types into skeletal muscle cells. So  is it possible that the tumor cells are going to the skeletal muscle tissue  but once in contact inside the skeletal muscle tissue  MyoD acts upon these tumor cells and causes them to become skeletal muscle cells  Maybe tumor cells are being disguised as skeletal muscle cells  and this is why it seems as if it is so rare. It's not harmful  it has just repaired the muscle. Muscle is constantly being used    constantly being damaged. If every time we tore a muscle or every time we stretched a muscle or moved in a wrong way  cancer occurred    I mean  everybody would have cancer almost. And I hate to say that. But it seems as though muscle cell  possibly because of all its use  has adapted faster than other body tissues to respond to injury  to fine tune this repair response and actually be able to finish the process which the body wants to finish. I really believe that the human body is very  very smart  and we can't counteract something the body is saying to do. It's different when a bacteria comes into the body    that's a foreign object    we want that out. But when the body is actually initiating a process and we're calling it a disease  it doesn't seem as though elimination is the right solution. So even to go from there  it's possible  although far fetched  that in the future we could almost think of cancer being used as a therapy. If those diseases where tissues are deteriorating    for example Alzheimer's  where the brain  the brain cells  die and we need to restore new brain cells  new functional brain cells    what if we could  in the future  use cancer  A tumor    put it in the brain and cause it to differentiate into brain cells  That's a very far fetched idea  but I really believe that it may be possible. These cells are so versatile  these cancer cells are so versatile    we just have to manipulate them in the right way. And again  some of these may be far fetched  but I figured if there's anywhere to present far fetched ideas  it's here at TED  so thank you very much.    minutes is an absolutely brutal time limit  so I'm going to dive straight in  right at the point where I get this thing to work. Here we go. I'm going to talk about five different things. I'm going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable. I'm going to talk about why we have to get our shit together  and actually talk about this a bit more than we do. I'm going to talk about feasibility as well  of course. I'm going to talk about why we are so fatalistic about doing anything about aging. And then I'm going spend perhaps the second half of the talk talking about  you know  how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong  namely  by actually doing something about it. I'm going to do that in two steps. The first one I'm going to talk about is how to get from a relatively modest amount of life extension    which I'm going to define as    years  applied to people who are already in middle age when you start    to a point which can genuinely be called defeating aging. Namely  essentially an elimination of the relationship between how old you are and how likely you are to die in the next year    or indeed  to get sick in the first place. And of course  the last thing I'm going to talk about is how to reach that intermediate step  that point of maybe    years life extension. So I'm going to start with why we should. Now  I want to ask a question. Hands up  anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria  That was easy. OK. OK. Hands up  anyone in the audience who's not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing  OK. So we all think malaria is a bad thing. That's very good news  because I thought that was what the answer would be. Now the thing is  I would like to put it to you that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging. And here is that characteristic. The only real difference is that aging kills considerably more people than malaria does. Now  I like in an audience  in Britain especially  to talk about the comparison with foxhunting  which is something that was banned after a long struggle  by the government not very many months ago. I mean  I know I'm with a sympathetic audience here  but  as we know  a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic. And this is actually a rather good comparison  it seems to me. You know  a lot of people said   Well  you know  city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time. It's a traditional part of the way of life  and we should be allowed to carry on doing it. It's ecologically sound  it stops the population explosion of foxes.  But ultimately  the government prevailed in the end  because the majority of the British public  and certainly the majority of members of Parliament  came to the conclusion that it was really something that should not be tolerated in a civilized society. And I think that human aging shares all of these characteristics in spades. What part of this do people not understand  It's not just about life  of course    it's about healthy life  you know    getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun  whether or not dying may be fun. So really  this is how I would like to describe it. It's a global trance. These are the sorts of unbelievable excuses that people give for aging. And  I mean  OK  I'm not actually saying that these excuses are completely valueless. There are some good points to be made here  things that we ought to be thinking about  forward planning so that nothing goes too    well  so that we minimize the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging. But these are completely crazy  when you actually remember your sense of proportion. You know  these are arguments  these are things that would be legitimate to be concerned about. But the question is  are they so dangerous    these risks of doing something about aging    that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite  namely  leaving aging as it is  Are these so bad that they outweigh condemning         people a day to an unnecessarily early death  You know  if you haven't got an argument that's that strong  then just don't waste my time  is what I say. Now  there is one argument that some people do think really is that strong  and here it is. People worry about overpopulation  they say   Well  if we fix aging  no one's going to die to speak of  or at least the death toll is going to be much lower  only from crossing St. Giles carelessly. And therefore  we're not going to be able to have many kids  and kids are really important to most people.  And that's true. And you know  a lot of people try to fudge this question  and give answers like this. I don't agree with those answers. I think they basically don't work. I think it's true  that we will face a dilemma in this respect. We will have to decide whether to have a low birth rate  or a high death rate. A high death rate will  of course  arise from simply rejecting these therapies  in favor of carrying on having a lot of kids. And  I say that that's fine    the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice. What's not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future. If we vacillate  hesitate  and do not actually develop these therapies  then we are condemning a whole cohort of people    who would have been young enough and healthy enough to benefit from those therapies  but will not be  because we haven't developed them as quickly as we could    we'll be denying those people an indefinite life span  and I consider that that is immoral. That's my answer to the overpopulation question. Right. So the next thing is  now why should we get a little bit more active on this  And the fundamental answer is that the pro aging trance is not as dumb as it looks. It's actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging. Aging is ghastly  but it's inevitable  so  you know  we've got to find some way to put it out of our minds  and it's rational to do anything that we might want to do  to do that. Like  for example  making up these ridiculous reasons why aging is actually a good thing after all. But of course  that only works when we have both of these components. And as soon as the inevitability bit becomes a little bit unclear    and we might be in range of doing something about aging    this becomes part of the problem. This pro aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things. And that's why we have to really talk about this a lot    evangelize  I will go so far as to say  quite a lot    in order to get people's attention  and make people realize that they are in a trance in this regard. So that's all I'm going to say about that. I'm now going to talk about feasibility. And the fundamental reason  I think  why we feel that aging is inevitable is summed up in a definition of aging that I'm giving here. A very simple definition. Aging is a side effect of being alive in the first place  which is to say  metabolism. This is not a completely tautological statement  it's a reasonable statement. Aging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars  and it also happens to us  despite the fact that we have a lot of clever self repair mechanisms  because those self repair mechanisms are not perfect. So basically  metabolism  which is defined as basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next  has side effects. Those side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology. That's a fine definition. So we can put it this way  we can say that  you know  we have this chain of events. And there are really two games in town  according to most people  with regard to postponing aging. They're what I'm calling here the  gerontology approach  and the  geriatrics approach.  The geriatrician will intervene late in the day  when pathology is becoming evident  and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time  and stop the accumulation of side effects from causing the pathology quite so soon. Of course  it's a very short term ist strategy  it's a losing battle  because the things that are causing the pathology are becoming more abundant as time goes on. The gerontology approach looks much more promising on the surface  because  you know  prevention is better than cure. But unfortunately the thing is that we don't understand metabolism very well. In fact  we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work    even cells we're not really too good on yet. We've discovered things like  for example  RNA interference only a few years ago  and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work. Basically  gerontology is a fine approach in the end  but it is not an approach whose time has come when we're talking about intervention. So then  what do we do about that  I mean  that's a fine logic  that sounds pretty convincing  pretty ironclad  doesn't it  But it isn't. Before I tell you why it isn't  I'm going to go a little bit into what I'm calling step two. Just suppose  as I said  that we do acquire    let's say we do it today for the sake of argument    the ability to confer    extra years of healthy life on people who are already in middle age  let's say   . I'm going to call that  robust human rejuvenation.  OK. What would that actually mean for how long people of various ages today    or equivalently  of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive    would actually live  In order to answer that question    you might think it's simple  but it's not simple. We can't just say   Well  if they're young enough to benefit from these therapies  then they'll live    years longer.  That's the wrong answer. And the reason it's the wrong answer is because of progress. There are two sorts of technological progress really  for this purpose. There are fundamental  major breakthroughs  and there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughs. Now  they differ a great deal in terms of the predictability of time frames. Fundamental breakthroughs  very hard to predict how long it's going to take to make a fundamental breakthrough. It was a very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun  and it took us until      to actually work out how to do it. But after that  things were pretty steady and pretty uniform. I think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened in the progression of the technology of powered flight. We can think  really  that each one is sort of beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one  if you like. The incremental advances have added up to something which is not incremental anymore. This is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough. And you see it in all sorts of technologies. Computers  you can look at a more or less parallel time line  happening of course a bit later. You can look at medical care. I mean  hygiene  vaccines  antibiotics    you know  the same sort of time frame. So I think that actually step two  that I called a step a moment ago  isn't a step at all. That in fact  the people who are young enough to benefit from these first therapies that give this moderate amount of life extension  even though those people are already middle aged when the therapies arrive  will be at some sort of cusp. They will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments that will give them a further    or maybe    years. In other words  they will be staying ahead of the game. The therapies will be improving faster than the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us. This is a very important point for me to get across. Because  you know  most people  when they hear that I predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to       or more  they think that I'm saying that we're going to invent therapies in the next few decades that are so thoroughly eliminating aging that those therapies will let us live to       or more. I'm not saying that at all. I'm saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies will be enough. They'll never be perfect  but we'll be able to fix the things that     year olds die of  before we have any     year olds. And the same for     and     and so on. I decided to give this a little name  which is  longevity escape velocity.  Well  it seems to get the point across. So  these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live  in terms of remaining life expectancy  as measured by their health  for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive. If you're already      or even if you're       and an average    year old  we probably can't do a lot for you with these therapies  because you're too close to death's door for the really initial  experimental therapies to be good enough for you. You won't be able to withstand them. But if you're only     then there's a chance that you might be able to pull out of the dive and  you know    eventually get through this and start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense  in terms of your youthfulness  both physical and mental  and in terms of your risk of death from age related causes. And of course  if you're a bit younger than that  then you're never really even going to get near to being fragile enough to die of age related causes. So this is a genuine conclusion that I come to  that the first     year old    we don't know how old that person is today  because we don't know how long it's going to take to get these first generation therapies. But irrespective of that age  I'm claiming that the first person to live to          subject of course  to  you know  global catastrophes    is actually  probably  only about    years younger than the first     year old. And that's quite a thought. Alright  so finally I'm going to spend the rest of the talk  my last seven and a half minutes  on step one  namely  how do we actually get to this moderate amount of life extension that will allow us to get to escape velocity  And in order to do that  I need to talk about mice a little bit. I have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation. I'm calling it  robust mouse rejuvenation   not very imaginatively. And this is what it is. I say we're going to take a long lived strain of mouse  which basically means mice that live about three years on average. We do exactly nothing to them until they're already two years old. And then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them  and with those therapies  we get them to live  on average  to their fifth birthday. So  in other words  we add two years    we treble their remaining lifespan  starting from the point that we started the therapies. The question then is  what would that actually mean for the time frame until we get to the milestone I talked about earlier for humans  Which we can now  as I've explained  equivalently call either robust human rejuvenation or longevity escape velocity. Secondly  what does it mean for the public's perception of how long it's going to take for us to get to those things  starting from the time we get the mice  And thirdly  the question is  what will it do to actually how much people want it  And it seems to me that the first question is entirely a biology question  and it's extremely hard to answer. One has to be very speculative  and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation  that we should simply keep our counsel until we know more. I say that's nonsense. I say we absolutely are irresponsible if we stay silent on this. We need to give our best guess as to the time frame  in order to give people a sense of proportion so that they can assess their priorities. So  I say that we have a       chance of reaching this RHR milestone  robust human rejuvenation  within    years from the point that we get to robust mouse rejuvenation.    years from the robust mouse. The public's perception will probably be somewhat better than that. The public tends to underestimate how difficult scientific things are. So they'll probably think it's five years away. They'll be wrong  but that actually won't matter too much. And finally  of course  I think it's fair to say that a large part of the reason why the public is so ambivalent about aging now is the global trance I spoke about earlier  the coping strategy. That will be history at this point  because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans  since it's been postponed so very effectively in mice. So we're likely to end up with a very strong change in people's attitudes  and of course that has enormous implications. So in order to tell you now how we're going to get these mice  I'm going to add a little bit to my description of aging. I'm going to use this word  damage  to denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism and that eventually cause pathology. Because the critical thing about this is that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology  the damage itself is caused ongoing ly throughout life  starting before we're born. But it is not part of metabolism itself. And this turns out to be useful. Because we can re draw our original diagram this way. We can say that  fundamentally  the difference between gerontology and geriatrics is that gerontology tries to inhibit the rate at which metabolism lays down this damage. And I'm going to explain exactly what damage is in concrete biological terms in a moment. And geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time by stopping the damage converting into pathology. And the reason it's a losing battle is because the damage is continuing to accumulate. So there's a third approach  if we look at it this way. We can call it the  engineering approach   and I claim that the engineering approach is within range. The engineering approach does not intervene in any processes. It does not intervene in this process or this one. And that's good because it means that it's not a losing battle  and it's something that we are within range of being able to do  because it doesn't involve improving on evolution. The engineering approach simply says   Let's go and periodically repair all of these various types of damage    not necessarily repair them completely  but repair them quite a lot  so that we keep the level of damage down below the threshold that must exist  that causes it to be pathogenic.  We know that this threshold exists  because we don't get age related diseases until we're in middle age  even though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born. Why do I say that we're in range  Well  this is basically it. The point about this slide is actually the bottom. If we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging  we will be here all night  because basically all of metabolism is important for aging in one way or another. This list is just for illustration  it is incomplete. The list on the right is also incomplete. It's a list of types of pathology that are age related  and it's just an incomplete list. But I would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually complete    this is the list of types of thing that qualify as damage  side effects of metabolism that cause pathology in the end  or that might cause pathology. And there are only seven of them. They're categories of things  of course  but there's only seven of them. Cell loss  mutations in chromosomes  mutations in the mitochondria and so on. First of all  I'd like to give you an argument for why that list is complete. Of course one can make a biological argument. One can say   OK  what are we made of   We're made of cells and stuff between cells. What can damage accumulate in  The answer is  long lived molecules  because if a short lived molecule undergoes damage  but then the molecule is destroyed    like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis    then the damage is gone  too. It's got to be long lived molecules. So  these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago and that is pretty good news  because it means that  you know  we've come a long way in biology in these    years  so the fact that we haven't extended this list is a pretty good indication that there's no extension to be done. However  it's better than that  we actually know how to fix them all  in mice  in principle    and what I mean by in principle is  we probably can actually implement these fixes within a decade. Some of them are partially implemented already  the ones at the top. I haven't got time to go through them at all  but my conclusion is that  if we can actually get suitable funding for this  then we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only    years  but we do need to get serious about it. We do need to really start trying. So of course  there are some biologists in the audience  and I want to give some answers to some of the questions that you may have. You may have been dissatisfied with this talk  but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff. I've published a great deal on this  I cite the experimental work on which my optimism is based  and there's quite a lot of detail there. The detail is what makes me confident of my rather aggressive time frames that I'm predicting here. So if you think that I'm wrong  you'd better damn well go and find out why you think I'm wrong. And of course the main thing is that you shouldn't trust people who call themselves gerontologists because  as with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field  you know  you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant and not really to take it seriously. So  you know  you've got to actually do your homework  in order to understand whether this is true. And we'll just end with a few things. One thing is  you know  you'll be hearing from a guy in the next session who said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in half no time  and everyone said   Well  it's obviously impossible.  And you know what happened. So  you know  this does happen. We have various strategies    there's the Methuselah Mouse Prize  which is basically an incentive to innovate  and to do what you think is going to work  and you get money for it if you win. There's a proposal to actually put together an institute. This is what's going to take a bit of money. But  I mean  look    how long does it take to spend that on the war in Iraq  Not very long. OK. It's got to be philanthropic  because profits distract biotech  but it's basically got a    percent chance  I think  of succeeding in this. And I think we know how to do it. And I'll stop there. Thank you. Chris Anderson  OK. I don't know if there's going to be any questions but I thought I would give people the chance. Audience  Since you've been talking about aging and trying to defeat it  why is it that you make yourself appear like an old man  AG  Because I am an old man. I am actually    . Audience  Species on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate. However  as far as I know  all the species have evolved to actually die  so when cells divide  the telomerase get shorter  and eventually species die. So  why does    evolution has    seems to have selected against immortality  when it is so advantageous  or is evolution just incomplete  AG  Brilliant. Thank you for asking a question that I can answer with an uncontroversial answer. I'm going to tell you the genuine mainstream answer to your question  which I happen to agree with  which is that  no  aging is not a product of selection  evolution   aging  is simply a product of evolutionary neglect. In other words  we have aging because it's hard work not to have aging  you need more genetic pathways  more sophistication in your genes in order to age more slowly  and that carries on being true the longer you push it out. So  to the extent that evolution doesn't matter  doesn't care whether genes are passed on by individuals  living a long time or by procreation  there's a certain amount of modulation of that  which is why different species have different lifespans  but that's why there are no immortal species. CA  The genes don't care but we do  AG  That's right. Audience  Hello. I read somewhere that in the last    years  the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by    years. If I project that  that would make me think that I would live until     if I don't crash on my motorbike. That means that I'm one of your subjects to become a       year old  AG  If you lose a bit of weight. Your numbers are a bit out. The standard numbers are that lifespans have been growing at between one and two years per decade. So  it's not quite as good as you might think  you might hope. But I intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possible. Audience  I was told that many of the brain cells we have as adults are actually in the human embryo  and that the brain cells last    years or so. If that is indeed true  biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation  If there are cells in my body that live all    years  as opposed to a typical  you know  couple of months  AG  There are technical implications certainly. Basically what we need to do is replace cells in those few areas of the brain that lose cells at a respectable rate  especially neurons  but we don't want to replace them any faster than that    or not much faster anyway  because replacing them too fast would degrade cognitive function. What I said about there being no non aging species earlier on was a little bit of an oversimplification. There are species that have no aging    Hydra for example    but they do it by not having a nervous system    and not having any tissues in fact that rely for their function on very long lived cells. I'll just take you to Bangladesh for a minute. Before I tell that story  we should ask ourselves the question  Why does poverty exist  I mean  there is plenty of knowledge and scientific breakthroughs. We all live in the same planet  but there's still a great deal of poverty in the world. And I think    so I want to throw a perspective that I have  so that we can assess this project  or any other project  for that matter  to see whether it's contributing or    contributing to poverty or trying to alleviate it. Rich countries have been sending aid to poor countries for the last    years. And by and large  this has failed. And you can see this book  written by someone who worked in the World Bank for    years  and he finds economic growth in this country to be elusive. By and large  it did not work. So the question is  why is that  In my mind  there is something to learn from the history of Europe. I mean  even here  yesterday I was walking across the street  and they showed three bishops were executed     years ago  right across the street from here. So my point is  there's a lot of struggle has gone in Europe  where citizens were empowered by technologies. And they demanded authorities from    to come down from their high horses. And in the end  there's better bargaining between the authorities and citizens  and democracies  capitalism    everything else flourished. And so you can see  the real process of    and this is backed up by this     page book    that the authorities came down and citizens got up. But if you look  if you have that perspective  then you can see what happened in the last    years. Aid actually did the opposite. It empowered authorities  and  as a result  marginalized citizens. The authorities did not have the reason to make economic growth happen so that they could tax people and make more money for to run their business. Because they were getting it from abroad. And in fact  if you see oil rich countries  where citizens are not yet empowered  the same thing goes    Nigeria  Saudi Arabia  all sorts of countries. Because the aid and oil or mineral money acts the same way. It empowers authorities  without activating the citizens    their hands  legs  brains  what have you. And if you agree with that  then I think the best way to improve these countries is to recognize that economic development is of the people  by the people  for the people. And that is the real network effect. If citizens can network and make themselves more organized and productive  so that their voices are heard  so then things would improve. And to contrast that  you can see the most important institution in the world  the World Bank  is an organization of the government  by the government  for the governments. Just see the contrast. And that is the perspective I have  and then I can start my story. Of course  how would you empower citizens  There could be all sorts of technologies. And one is cell phones. Recently  The Economist  recognized this  but I stumbled upon the idea    years ago  and that's what I've been working on. So    years ago  I was trying to be an investment banker in New York. We had    quite a few our colleagues were connected by a computer network. And we got more productive because we didn't have to exchange floppy disks  we could update each other more often. But one time it broke down. And it reminded me of a day in     . There was a war going on in my country. And my family moved out of an urban place  where we used to live  to a remote rural area where it was safer. And one time my mother asked me to get some medicine for a younger sibling. And I walked    miles or so  all morning  to get there  to the medicine man. And he wasn't there  so I walked all afternoon back. So I had another unproductive day. So while I was sitting in a tall building in New York  I put those two experiences together side by side  and basically concluded that connectivity is productivity    whether it's in a modern office or an underdeveloped village. So naturally  I    the implication of that is that the telephone is a weapon against poverty. And if that's the case  then the question is how many telephones did we have at that time  And it turns out  that there was one telephone in Bangladesh for every     people. And all those phones were in the few urban places. The vast rural areas  where     million people lived  there were no telephones. So just imagine how many man months or man years are wasted  just like I wasted a day. If you just multiply by     million people  let's say losing one day a month  whatever  and you see a vast amount of resource wasted. And after all  poor countries  like rich countries  one thing we've got equal  is their days are the same length     hours. So if you lose that precious resource  where you are somewhat equal to the richer countries  that's a huge waste. So I started looking for any evidence that    does connectivity really increase productivity  And I couldn't find much  really  but I found this graph produced by the ITU  which is the International Telecommunication Union  based in Geneva. They show an interesting thing. That you see  the horizontal axis is where you place your country. So the United States or the UK would be here  outside. And so the impact of one new telephone  which is on the vertical axis  is very little. But if you come back to a poorer country  where the GNP per capita is  let's say      dollars  or     dollars  then the impact is huge        dollars. Or       dollars. The question was  how much did it cost to install a new telephone in Bangladesh  It turns out        dollars. So if you spend       dollars  and let's say the telephone lasts    years  and if       dollars every year    so that's        dollars. So obviously this was a gadget to have. And of course  if the cost of installing a telephone is going down  because there's a digital revolution going on  then it would be even more dramatic. And I knew a little economics by then    it says Adam Smith taught us that specialization leads to productivity. But how would you specialize  Let's say I'm a fisherman and a farmer. And Chris is a fisherman farmer. Both are generalists. So the point is that we could only    the only way we could depend on each other  is if we can connect with each other. And if we are neighbors  I could just walk over to his house. But then we are limiting our economic sphere to something very small area. But in order to expand that  you need a river  or you need a highway  or you need telephone lines. But in any event  it's connectivity that leads to dependability. And that leads to specialization. That leads to productivity. So the question was  I started looking at this issue  and going back and forth between Bangladesh and New York. There were a lot of reasons people told me why we don't have enough telephones. And one of them is the lacking buying power. Poor people apparently don't have the power to buy. But the point is  if it's a production tool  why do we have to worry about that  I mean  in America  people buy cars  and they put very little money down. They get a car  and they go to work. The work pays them a salary  the salary allows them to pay for the car over time. The car pays for itself. So if the telephone is a production tool  then we don't quite have to worry about the purchasing power. And of course  even if that's true  then what about initial buying power  So then the question is  why can't we have some kind of shared access  In the United States  we have    everybody needs a banking service  but very few of us are trying to buy a bank. So it's    a bank tends to serve a whole community. So we could do that for telephones. And also people told me that we have a lot of important primary needs to meet  food  clothing  shelter  whatever. But again  it's very paternalistic. You should be raising income and let people decide what they want to do with their money. But the real problem is the lack of other infrastructures. See  you need some kind of infrastructure to bring a new thing. For instance  the Internet was booming in the U.S. because there were    there were people who had computers. They had modems. They had telephone lines  so it's very easy to bring in a new idea  like the Internet. But that's what's lacking in a poor country. So for example  we didn't have ways to have credit checks  few banks to collect bills  etc. But that's why I noticed Grameen Bank  which is a bank for poor people  and had       branches         employees   .  million borrowers. And they had these branches. I thought I could put cell towers and create a network. And anyway  to cut the time short    so I started    I first went to them and said   You know  perhaps I could connect all your branches and make you more efficient.  But you know  they have  after all  evolved in a country without telephones  so they are decentralized. I mean  of course there might be other good reasons  but this was one of the reasons    they had to be. And so they were not that interested to connect all their branches  and then to be    and rock the boat. So I started focusing. What is it that they really do  So what happens is that somebody borrows money from the bank. She typically buys a cow. The cow gives milk. And she sells the milk to the villagers  and pays off the loan. And this is a business for her  but it's milk for everybody else. And suddenly I realized that a cell phone could be a cow. Because some way she could borrow     dollars from the bank  get a phone and have the phone for everybody. And it's a business for her. So I wrote to the bank  and they thought for a while  and they said   It's a little crazy  but logical. If you think it can be done  come and make it happen.  So I quit my job  I went back to Bangladesh. I created a company in America called Gonofone  which in Bengali means  people's phone.  And angel investors in America put in money into that. I flew around the world. After about a million    I mean  I got rejected from lots of places  because I was not only trying to go to a poor country  I was trying to go to the poor of the poor country. After about a million miles  and a meaningful    a substantial loss of hair  I eventually put together a consortium  and    which involved the Norwegian telephone company  which provided the know how  and the Grameen Bank provided the infrastructure to spread the service. To make the story short  here is the coverage of the country. You can see it's pretty much covered. Even in Bangladesh  there are some empty places. But we are also investing around another     million dollars this year to extend that coverage. Now  about that cow model I talked about. There are about         people who are retailing telephone services in their neighborhoods. And it's serving        villages  which represent about    million people. And these phones are generating about     million dollars for the company. And two dollars profit per entrepreneur per day  which is like     dollars per year. And of course  it's very beneficial in a lot of ways. It increases income  improves welfare  etc. And the result is  right now  this company is the largest telephone company  with  .  million subscribers          of these phones I talked about    that produces about a third of the traffic in the network. And       the net profit  after taxes    very serious taxes    was     million dollars. And the company contributed about     million dollars to the government coffers. And again  here are some of the lessons.  The government needs to provide economically viable services.  Actually  this is an instance where private companies can provide that.  Governments need to subsidize private companies.  This is what some people think. And actually  private companies help governments with taxes.  Poor people are recipients.  Poor people are a resource.  Services cost too much for the poor.  Their involvement reduces the cost.  The poor are uneducated and cannot do much.  They are very eager learners and very capable survivors. I've been very surprised. Most of them learn how to operate a telephone within a day.  Poor countries need aid.  Businesses    this one company has raised the    if the ideal figures are even five percent true  this one company is raising the GNP of the country much more than the aid the country receives. And as I was trying to show you  as far as I'm concerned  aid does damages because it removes the government from its citizens. And this is a new project I have with Dean Kamen  the famous inventor in America. He has produced some power generators  which we are now doing an experiment in Bangladesh  in two villages where cow manure is producing biogas  which is running these generators. And each of these generators is selling electricity to    houses each. It's just an experiment. We don't know how far it will go  but it's going on. Thank you. I want to start with a story  a la Seth Godin  from when I was    years old. My uncle Ed gave me a beautiful blue sweater    at least I thought it was beautiful. And it had fuzzy zebras walking across the stomach  and Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Meru were kind of right across the chest  that were also fuzzy. And I wore it whenever I could  thinking it was the most fabulous thing I owned. Until one day in ninth grade  when I was standing with a number of the football players. And my body had clearly changed  and Matt  who was undeniably my nemesis in high school  said in a booming voice that we no longer had to go far away to go on ski trips  but we could all ski on Mount Novogratz. And I was so humiliated and mortified that I immediately ran home to my mother and chastised her for ever letting me wear the hideous sweater. We drove to the Goodwill and we threw the sweater away somewhat ceremoniously  my idea being that I would never have to think about the sweater nor see it ever again. Fast forward       years later  I'm a    year old kid. I'm working in Kigali  Rwanda  jogging through the steep slopes  when I see     feet in front of me  a little boy       years old    running toward me  wearing my sweater. And I'm thinking  no  this is not possible. But so  curious  I run up to the child    of course scaring the living bejesus out of him    grab him by the collar  turn it over  and there is my name written on the collar of this sweater. I tell that story  because it has served and continues to serve as a metaphor to me about the level of connectedness that we all have on this Earth. We so often don't realize what our action and our inaction does to people we think we will never see and never know. I also tell it because it tells a larger contextual story of what aid is and can be. That this traveled into the Goodwill in Virginia  and moved its way into the larger industry  which at that point was giving millions of tons of secondhand clothing to Africa and Asia. Which was a very good thing  providing low cost clothing. And at the same time  certainly in Rwanda  it destroyed the local retailing industry. Not to say that it shouldn't have  but that we have to get better at answering the questions that need to be considered when we think about consequences and responses. So  I'm going to stick in Rwanda  circa             where I was doing two things. I had started a bakery with    unwed mothers. We were called the  Bad News Bears   and our notion was we were going to corner the snack food business in Kigali  which was not hard because there were no snacks before us. And because we had a good business model  we actually did it  and I watched these women transform on a micro level. But at the same time  I started a micro finance bank  and tomorrow Iqbal Quadir is going to talk about Grameen  which is the grandfather of all micro finance banks  which now is a worldwide movement    you talk about a meme    but then it was quite new  especially in an economy that was moving from barter into trade. We got a lot of things right. We focused on a business model  we insisted on skin in the game. The women made their own decisions at the end of the day as to how they would use this access to credit to build their little businesses  earn more income so they could take care of their families better. What we didn't understand  what was happening all around us  with the confluence of fear  ethnic strife and certainly an aid game  if you will  that was playing into this invisible but certainly palpable movement inside Rwanda  that at that time     percent of the budget was all foreign aid. The genocide happened in       seven years after these women all worked together to build this dream. And the good news was that the institution  the banking institution  lasted. In fact  it became the largest rehabilitation lender in the country. The bakery was completely wiped out  but the lessons for me were that accountability counts    got to build things with people on the ground  using business models where  as Steven Levitt would say  the incentives matter. Understand  however complex we may be  incentives matter. So when Chris raised to me how wonderful everything that was happening in the world  that we were seeing a shift in zeitgeist  on the one hand I absolutely agree with him  and I was so thrilled to see what happened with the G     that the world  because of people like Tony Blair and Bono and Bob Geldof    the world is talking about global poverty  the world is talking about Africa in ways I have never seen in my life. It's thrilling. And at the same time  what keeps me up at night is a fear that we'll look at the victories of the G        billion dollars in increased aid to Africa     billion in reduced debt    as the victory  as more than chapter one  as our moral absolution. And in fact  what we need to do is see that as chapter one  celebrate it  close it  and recognize that we need a chapter two that is all about execution  all about the how to. And if you remember one thing from what I want to talk about today  it's that the only way to end poverty  to make it history  is to build viable systems on the ground that deliver critical and affordable goods and services to the poor  in ways that are financially sustainable and scaleable. If we do that  we really can make poverty history. And it was that    that whole philosophy    that encouraged me to start my current endeavor called  Acumen Fund   which is trying to build some mini blueprints for how we might do that in water  health and housing in Pakistan  India  Kenya  Tanzania and Egypt. And I want to talk a little bit about that  and some of the examples  so you can see what it is that we're doing. But before I do this    and this is another one of my pet peeves    I want to talk a little bit about who the poor are. Because we too often talk about them as these strong  huge masses of people yearning to be free  when in fact  it's quite an amazing story. On a macro level  four billion people on Earth make less than four dollars a day. That's who we talk about when we think about  the poor.  If you aggregate it  it's the third largest economy on Earth  and yet most of these people go invisible. Where we typically work  there's people making between one and three dollars a day. Who are these people  They are farmers and factory workers. They work in government offices. They're drivers. They are domestics. They typically pay for critical goods and services like water  like healthcare  like housing  and they pay    to    times what their middleclass counterparts pay    certainly where we work in Karachi and Nairobi. The poor also are willing to make  and do make  smart decisions  if you give them that opportunity. So  two examples. One is in India  where there are     million farmers  most of whom make less than two dollars a day. Where we work in Aurangabad  the land is extraordinarily parched. You see people on average making    cents to a dollar. This guy in pink is a social entrepreneur named Ami Tabar. What he did was see what was happening in Israel  larger approaches  and figure out how to do a drip irrigation  which is a way of bringing water directly to the plant stock. But previously it's only been created for large scale farms  so Ami Tabar took this and modularized it down to an eighth of an acre. A couple of principles  build small. Make it infinitely expandable and affordable to the poor. This family  Sarita and her husband  bought a    dollar unit when they were living in a    literally a three walled lean to with a corrugated iron roof. After one harvest  they had increased their income enough to buy a second system to do their full quarter acre. A couple of years later  I meet them. They now make four dollars a day  which is pretty much middle class for India  and they showed me the concrete foundation they had just laid to build their house. And I swear  you could see the future in that woman's eyes. Something I truly believe. You can't talk about poverty today without talking about malaria bed nets  and I again give Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard huge kudos for bringing to the world this notion of his rage    for five dollars you can save a life. Malaria is a disease that kills one to three million people a year.     to     million cases are reported. It's estimated that Africa loses about    billion dollars a year to the disease. Five dollars can save a life. We can send people to the moon  we can see if there's life on Mars    why can't we get five dollar nets to     million people  The question  though  is not  Why can't we   The question is how can we help Africans do this for themselves  A lot of hurdles. One  production is too low. Two  price is too high. Three  this is a good road in    right near where our factory is located. Distribution is a nightmare  but not impossible. We started by making a         dollar loan to the largest traditional bed net manufacturer in Africa so that they could transfer technology from Japan and build these long lasting  five year nets. Here are just some pictures of the factory. Today  three years later  the company has employed another thousand women. It contributes about         dollars in wages to the economy of Tanzania. It's the largest company in Tanzania. The throughput rate right now is  .  million nets  three million by the end of the year. We hope to have seven million at the end of next year. So the production side is working. On the distribution side  though  as a world  we have a lot of work to do. Right now     percent of these nets are being bought by the U.N.  and then given primarily to people around Africa. We're looking at building on some of the most precious resources of Africa  people. Their women. And so I want you to meet Jacqueline  my namesake     years old. If she were born anywhere else but Tanzania  I'm telling you  she could run Wall Street. She runs two of the lines  and has already saved enough money to put a down payment on her house. She makes about two dollars a day  is creating an education fund  and told me she is not marrying nor having children until these things are completed. And so  when I told her about our idea    that maybe we could take a Tupperware model from the United States  and find a way for the women themselves to go out and sell these nets to others    she quickly started calculating what she herself could make and signed up. We took a lesson from IDEO  one of our favorite companies  and quickly did a prototyping on this  and took Jacqueline into the area where she lives. She brought    of the women with whom she interacts together to see if she could sell these nets  five dollars apiece  despite the fact that people say nobody will buy one  and we learned a lot about how you sell things. Not coming in with our own notions  because she didn't even talk about malaria until the very end. First  she talked about comfort  status  beauty. These nets  she said  you put them on the floor  bugs leave your house. Children can sleep through the night  the house looks beautiful  you hang them in the window. And we've started making curtains  and not only is it beautiful  but people can see status    that you care about your children. Only then did she talk about saving your children's lives. A lot of lessons to be learned in terms of how we sell goods and services to the poor. I want to end just by saying that there's enormous opportunity to make poverty history. To do it right  we have to build business models that matter  that are scaleable and that work with Africans  Indians  people all over the developing world who fit in this category  to do it themselves. Because at the end of the day  it's about engagement. It's about understanding that people really don't want handouts  that they want to make their own decisions  they want to solve their own problems  and that by engaging with them  not only do we create much more dignity for them  but for us as well. And so I urge all of you to think next time as to how to engage with this notion and this opportunity that we all have    to make poverty history    by really becoming part of the process and moving away from an us and them world  and realizing that it's about all of us  and the kind of world that we  together  want to live in and share. Thank you. A public  Dewey long ago observed  is constituted through discussion and debate. If we are to call the tyranny of assumptions into question  and avoid doxa  the realm of the unquestioned  then we must be willing to subject our own assumptions to debate and discussion. It is in this spirit that I join into a discussion of one of the critical issues of our time  namely  how to mobilize different forms of capital for the project of state building. To put the assumptions very clearly  capitalism  after     years  has become acceptable  and so has democracy. If we looked in the world of      and looked at the map of capitalist economies and democratic polities  they were the rare exception  not the norm. The question now  however  is both about which form of capitalism and which type of democratic participation. But we must acknowledge that this moment has brought about a rare consensus of assumptions. And that provides the ground for a type of action  because consensus of each moment allows us to act. And it is necessary  no matter how fragile or how provisional our consensus  to be able to move forward. But the majority of the world neither benefits from capitalism nor from democratic systems. Most of the globe experiences the state as repressive  as an organization that is concerned about denial of rights  about denial of justice  rather than provision of it. And in terms of experience of capitalism  there are two aspects that the rest of the globe experiences. First  extractive industry. Blood diamonds  smuggled emeralds  timber  that is cut right from under the poorest. Second is technical assistance. And technical assistance might shock you  but it's the worst form of    today    of the ugly face of the developed world to the developing countries. Tens of billions of dollars are supposedly spent on building capacity with people who are paid up to       dollars a day  who are incapable of thinking creatively  or organically. Next assumption    and of course the events of July    I express my deep sympathy  and before that  September       have reminded us we do not live in three different worlds. We live in one world. But that's easily said. But we are not dealing with the implications of the one world that we are living in. And that is that if we want to have one world  this one world cannot be based on huge pockets of exclusion  and then inclusion for some. We must now finally come to think about the premises of a truly global world  in relationship to the regime of rights and responsibilities and accountabilities that are truly global in scope. Otherwise we will be missing this open moment in history  where we have a consensus on both the form of politics and the form of economics. What is one of these organizations to pick  We have three critical terms  economy  civil society and the state. I will not deal with those first two  except to say that uncritical transfer of assumptions  from one context to another  can only make for disaster. Economics taught in most of the elite universities are practically useless in my context. My country is dominated by drug economy and a mafia. Textbook economics does not work in my context  and I have very few recommendations from anybody as to how to put together a legal economy. The poverty of our knowledge must become the first basis of moving forward  and not imposition of the framework that works on the basis of mathematical modeling  for which I have enormous respect. My colleagues at Johns Hopkins were among the best. Second  instead of debating endlessly about what is the structure of the state  why don't we simplify and say  what are a series of functions that the state in the   st century must perform  Clare Lockhart and I are writing a book on this  we hope to share that much widely with    and third is that we could actually construct an index to measure comparatively how well these functions that we would agree on are being performed in different places. So what are these functions  We propose   . And it's legitimate monopoly of means of violence  administrative control  management of public finances  investment in human capital  provision of citizenship rights  provision of infrastructure  management of the tangible and intangible assets of the state through regulation  creation of the market  international agreements  including public borrowing  and then  most importantly  rule of law. I won't elaborate. I hope the questions will give me an opportunity. This is a feasible goal  basically because  contrary to widespread assumption  I would argue that we know how to do this. Who would have imagined that Germany would be either united or democratic today  if you looked at it from the perspective of Oxford of       But people at Oxford prepared for a democratic Germany and engaged in planning. And there are lots of other examples. Now in order to do this    and this brings this group    we have to rethink the notion of capital. The least important form of capital  in this project  is financial capital    money. Money is not capital in most of the developing countries. It's just cash. Because it lacks the institutional  organizational  managerial forms to turn it into capital. And what is required is a combination of physical capital  institutional capital  human capital    and security  of course  is critical  but so is information. Now  the issue that should concern us here    and that's the challenge that I would like to pose to this group    is again  it takes    years in your countries to produce somebody with a B.S. degree. It takes    years to produce somebody with a Ph.D. The first challenge is to rethink  fundamentally  the issue of the time. Do we need to repeat the modalities that we have inherited  Our educational systems are inherited from the   th century. What is it that we need to do fundamentally to re engage in a project  that capital formation is rapid  The absolute majority of the world's population are below     and they are growing larger and faster. They need different ways of being approached  different ways of being enfranchised  different ways of being skilled. And that's the first thing. Second is  you're problem solvers  but you're not engaging your global responsibility. You've stayed away from the problems of corruption. You only want clean environments in which to function. But if you don't think through the problems of corruption  who will  You stay away from design for development. You're great designers  but your designs are selfish. It's for your own immediate use. The world in which I operate operates with designs regarding roads  or dams  or provision of electricity that have not been revisited in    years. This is not right. It requires thinking. But  particularly  what we need more than anything else from this group is your imagination to be brought to bear on problems the way a meme is supposed to work. As the work on paradigms  long time ago showed    Thomas Kuhn's work    it's in the intersection of ideas that new developments    true breakthroughs    occur. And I hope that this group would be able to deal with the issue of state and development and the empowerment of the majority of the world's poor  through this means. Thank you. Chris Anderson  So  Ashraf  until recently  you were the finance minister of Afghanistan  a country right at the middle of much of the world's agenda. Is the country gonna make it  Will democracy flourish  What scares you most  Ashraf Ghani  What scares me most is    is you  lack of your engagement. You asked me. You know I always give the unconventional answer. No. But seriously  the issue of Afghanistan first has to be seen as  at least  a     to    year perspective. Today the world of globalization is on speed. Time has been compressed. And space does not exist for most people. But in my world    you know  when I went back to Afghanistan after    years  space had expanded. Every conceivable form of infrastructure had broken down. I rode    traveled    travel between two cities that used to take three hours now took   . So the first is when the scale is that  we need to recognize that just the simple things that are infrastructure    it takes six years to deliver infrastructure. In our world. Any meaningful sort of thing. But the modality of attention  or what is happening today  what's happening tomorrow. Second is  when a country has been subjected to one of the most immense  brutal forms of exercise of power    we had the Red Army for    continuous years          strong  literally terrorizing. The sky  every Afghan sees the sky as a source of fear. We were bombed practically out of existence. Then  tens of thousands of people were trained in terrorism    from all sides. The United States  Great Britain  joined for instance  Egyptian intelligence service to train thousands of people in resistance and urban terrorism. How to turn a bicycle into an instrument of terror. How to turn a donkey  a carthorse  anything. And the Russians  equally. So  when violence erupts in a country like Afghanistan  it's because of that legacy. But we have to understand that we've been incredibly lucky. I mean  I really can't believe how lucky I am here  standing in front of you  speaking. When I joined as finance minister  I thought that the chances of my living more than three years would not be more than five percent. Those were the risks. They were worth it. I think we can make it  and the reason we can make it is because of the people. You see  because  I mean    I give you one statistic.    percent of the men in Afghanistan     percent of the women  listen to at least three radio stations a day. In terms of their discourse  in terms of their sophistication of knowledge of the world  I think that I would dare say  they're much more sophisticated than rural Americans with college degrees and the bulk of Europeans    because the world matters to them. And what is their predominant concern  Abandonment. Afghans have become deeply internationalist. You know  when I went back in December of       I had absolutely no desire to work with the Afghan government because I'd lived as a nationalist. And I told them    my people  with the Americans here    separate. Yes  I have an advisory position with the U.N. I went through    Afghan provinces very rapidly. And everybody was telling me it was a different world. You know  they engage. They see engagement  global engagement  as absolutely necessary to the future of the ordinary people. And the thing that the ordinary Afghan is most concerned with is    Clare Lockhart is here  so I'll recite a discussion she had with an illiterate woman in Northern Afghanistan. And that woman said she didn't care whether she had food on her table. What she worried about was whether there was a plan for the future  where her children could really have a different life. That gives me hope. CA  How is Afghanistan going to provide alternative income to the many people who are making their living off the drugs trade  AG  Certainly. Well  the first is  instead of sending a billion dollars on drug eradication and paying it to a couple of security companies  they should give this hundred billion dollars to    of the most critically innovative companies in the world to ask them to create one million jobs. The key to the drug eradication is jobs. Look  there's a very little known fact  countries that have a legal average income per capita of       dollars don't produce drugs. Second  textile. Trade is the key  not aid. The U.S. and Europe should give us a zero percent tariff. The textile industry is incredibly mobile. If you want us to be able to compete with China and to attract investment  we could probably attract four to six billion dollars quite easily in the textile sector  if there was zero tariffs    would create the type of job. Cotton does not compete with opium  a t shirt does. And we need to understand  it's the value chain. Look  the ordinary Afghan is sick and tired of hearing about microcredit. It is important  but what the ordinary women and men who engage in micro production want is global access. They don't want to sell to the charity bazaars that are only for foreigners    and the same bloody shirt embroidered time and again. What we want is a partnership with the Italian design firms. Yeah  we have the best embroiderers in the world  Why can't we do what was done with northern Italy  With the Put Out system  So I think economically  the critical issue really is to now think through. And what I will say here is that aid doesn't work. You know  the aid system is broken. The aid system does not have the knowledge  the vision  the ability. I'm all for it  after all  I raised a lot of it. Yeah  to be exact  you know  I managed to persuade the world that they had to give my country   .  billion. They didn't want to give us the money. CA  And it still didn't work  AG  No. It's not that it didn't work. It's that a dollar of private investment  in my judgment  is equal at least to    dollars of aid  in terms of the dynamic that it generates. Second is that one dollar of aid could be    cents  it could be    cents  or it could be four dollars. It depends on what form it comes  what degrees of conditionalities are attached to it. You know  the aid system  at first  was designed to benefit entrepreneurs of the developed countries  not to generate growth in the poor countries. And this is  again  one of those assumptions    the way car seats are an assumption that we've inherited in governments  and doors. You would think that the US government would not think that American firms needed subsidizing to function in developing countries  provide advice  but they do. There's an entire weight of history vis a vis aid that now needs to be reexamined. If the goal is to build states that can credibly take care of themselves    and I'm putting that proposition equally  you know I'm very harsh on my counterparts    aid must end in each country in a definable period. And every year there must be progress on mobilization of domestic revenue and generation of the economy. Unless that kind of compact is entered into  you will not be able to sustain the consensus. Video  Narrator  An event seen from one point of view gives one impression. Seen from another point of view  it gives quite a different impression. But it's only when you get the whole picture you can fully understand what's going on. Sasha Vucinic  It's a great clip  isn't it  And I found that in    seconds  it tells more about the power of  and importance of  independent media than I could say in an hour. So I thought that it will be good to start with it. And also start with a little bit of statistics. According to relevant researchers     percent of the population of this planet lives in the societies without independent press. Think about that number     percent of the population on the whole planet does not really know what is going on in their countries. The information they get gets filtered through somebody who either twists that information  or colors that information  does something with it. So they're deprived of understanding their reality. That is just to understand how big and important this problem is. Now those of you who are lucky enough to live in those societies that represent    percent  I think should enjoy it until it lasts. You know  Sunday morning  you flick the paper  get your cappuccino. Enjoy it while it lasts. Because as we heard yesterday  countries can lose stars from their flags  but they can also lose press freedom  as I guess Americans among us can tell us more about. But that's totally another and separate topic. So I can go back to my story. My story starts    the story I want to share    starts in     . At that time I was running B    the only independent  for that matter the only electronic media  in the country. And I guess we were sharing    we had that regular life of the only independent media in the country  operating in hostile environment  where government really wants to make your life miserable. And there are different ways. Yeah  it was the usual cocktail  a little bit of threats  a little bit of friendly advice  a little bit of financial police  a little bit of text control  so you always have somebody who never leaves your office. But what they really do  which is very powerful  and that is what governments in the late '  s started doing if they don't like independent media companies    you know  they threaten your advertisers. Once they threaten your advertisers  market forces are actually  you know  destroyed  and the advertisers do not want to come    no matter how much does it make sense for them    do not want to come and advertise. And you have a problem making ends meet. At that time at the beginning of the '  s  we had that problem  which was  you know  survival below one side  but what was really painful for me was  remember  the beginning of the '  s  Yugoslavia is falling apart. We were sitting over there with a country in a downfall  in a slow motion downfall. And we all had all of that on tapes. We had the ability to understand what was going on. We were actually recording history. The problem was that we had to re tape that history a week later  because if we did not  we could not afford enough tapes to keep archives of that history. So if I gave you that picture  I don't want to go too long on that. In that context a gentleman came to my office at that time. It was still     . He was running a media systems organization which is still in business  the gentleman is still in business. And what did I know at that time about media systems  I would think media systems were organizations  which means they should help you. So I prepared two plans for that meeting  two strategic plans  the small one and the big one. The small one was  I just wanted him to help us get those damn tapes  so we can keep that archive for the next    years. The big plan was to ask him for a           dollar loan. Because I thought  I still maintain  that serious and independent media companies are great business. And I thought that B   will survive and be a great company once Milosevic is gone  which turned out to be true. It's now probably either the biggest or the second biggest media company in the country. And I thought that the only thing that we needed at that time was           dollar loan to take us through those hard times. To make a long story short  the gentleman comes into the office  great suit and tie. I gave him what I thought was a brilliant explanation of the political situation and explained how hard and difficult the war will be. Actually  I underestimated the atrocities  I have to admit. Anyway  after that whole  big  long explanation  the only question he had for me    and this is not a joke    is  are we paying royalties after we broadcast music of Michael Jackson  That was really the only question he had. He left  and I remember being actually very angry at myself because I thought there must be an institution in the world that is providing loans to media companies. It's so obvious  straight in your face  and somebody must have thought of it. Somebody must have started something like that. And I thought  I'm just dumb and I cannot find it. You know  in my defense  there was no Google at that time  you could not just Google in '  . So I thought that that's actually my problem. Now we go from here  fast forward to     . I have    I left the country  I have a meeting with George Soros  trying for the third time to convince him that his foundation should invest in something that should operate like a media bank. And basically what I was saying is very simple. You know  forget about charity  it doesn't work. Forget about handouts         dollars do not help anybody. What you should do is you should treat media companies as a business. It's business anywhere. Media business  or any other business  it needs to be capitalized. And what these guys need  actually  is access to capital. So third meeting  arguments are pretty well exercised. At the end of the meeting he says  look  it is not going to work  you will never see your money back  but my foundations will put         dollars so you can test the idea. See that it will not work. He said  I'll give you a rope to hang yourself. I knew two things after that meeting. First  under no circumstances I want to hang myself. And second  that I have no idea how to make it work. You see  at the level of a concept  it was a great concept. But it's one thing to have a concept  it's a totally separate thing to actually make it work. So I had absolutely no idea how that could actually work. Had the wrong idea  I thought that we can be a bank. You see banks    I don't know if there are any bankers over here  I apologize in advance    but it's the best job in the world. You know  you find somebody who is respectable and has a lot of money. You give them more money  they repay you that over a time. You collect interest and do nothing in between. So I thought  why don't we get into that business  So here we are having our first client  brilliant. First independent newspaper in Slovakia. The government cutting them off from all the printing facilities in Bratislava. So here's the daily newspaper that has to be printed     kilometers away from the capital. It's a daily newspaper with a deadline of   p.m. That means that they have no sports  they have no latest news  circulation goes down. It's a kind of very nice  sophisticated way how to economically strangle a daily newspaper. They come to us with a request for a loan. They want to    the only way for them to survive is to get a printing press. And we said  that's fine  let's meet  you'll bring us your business plan  which eventually they did. We start the meeting. I get these two pieces of paper  not like this  A  format  so it's much bigger. A lot of numbers there. A lot of numbers. But however you put it  you know  the numbers do not make any sense. And that's the best they could do. We were the best that they could do. So that is how we understood what our method is. It's not a bank. We had to actually go into these companies and earn our return by fixing them    by establishing management systems  by providing all that knowledge  how do you run a business on one side    while they all know how to run  how to create content. Just quickly on the results. Over these    years     million dollars in affordable financing  average interest rate five percent to six percent. Lately we are going wild  charging seven percent from time to time. We do it in    countries of the developing world. And here is the most stunning number. Return rate    the one that Soros was so worried about       percent.    percent of all the scheduled repayments came back to us on time. What do we typically finance  We finance anything that a media company would need  from printing presses to transmitters. What is most important is we do it either in form of loans  equities  lease    whatever is appropriate for  you know  supporting anybody. But what is most important here is  who do we finance  We believe that in the last    years companies that we've financed are actually the best media companies in the developing world. That is a  Who is Who  list. And I could spend hours talking about them  because they're all kind of heroes. And I can  but I'll give you just  maybe one  and depending on time I may give you two examples who we work with. You see we started working in Eastern and Central Europe  and moved to Russia. Our first loan in Russia was in Chelyabinsk. I'll bet half of you have never heard of that place. In the south of Russia there's a guy called Boris Nikolayevich Kirshin  who is running an independent newspaper there. The city was closed until early '  s because  of all things  they were producing glass for Tupolev planes. Anyway  he's running independent newspaper there. After two years working with us  he becomes the most respected newspaper in that small place. Governor comes to him one day  actually invites him to come to his office. He goes and sees the governor. The governor says  Boris Nikolayevich  I understand you are doing a great job  and you are the most respected newspaper in our district. And I want to offer you a deal. Can you please give me your newspaper for the next nine months  because I have elections    there are elections coming up in nine months. I will not run  but it's very important for me who is going to succeed me. So give me the paper for nine months. I'll give it back to you. I have no interest in being in media business. How much would that cost  Boris Nikolayevich says   It's not for sale.  The governor says   We will close you.  Boris Nikolayevich says   No  you cannot do it.  Six months later the newspaper was closed. Luckily  we had enough time to help Boris Nikolayevich take all the assets out of that company and bring him into a new one  to get all the subscription lists  rehire staff. So what the governor got was an empty shell. But that is what happens if you're in business of independent media  and if you are a banker for independent media. So it sounds like a great story. Somewhere down the road we opened a media management center. We started our media lab  sounds like a real great story. But there is a second angle to that. The second angle  like in this clip. If you take the camera above  you start thinking about these numbers again.    million dollars over    years spread over    countries. That is not too much  is it  It's actually just a drop in the sea. Because when you think about the importance  some of the issues that we were talking about last night    this last session we had about Africa and his hypothetical    billion dollars destined for Africa. All of those  not all  half of those problems mentioned last night    government accountability  corruption  how do you fight corruption  giving voice to unheard  to poor    it's why independent media is in business. And it's why it was invented. So from that perspective  what we did is just really one drop in the sea of that need that we can identify. Now ours is just one story. I'm sure that in this room there are  like     other wonderful stories of nonprofits doing spectacular work. Here is where the problem is  and I'll explain to you as well as I can what the problem is. And it's called fundraising. Imagine that this third of this room is filled with people who represent different foundations. Imagine two thirds over here running excellent organizations  doing very important work. Now imagine that every second person over here is deaf  does not hear  and switch the lights off. Now that is how difficult it is to match people from this side of the room with people of that side of the room. So we thought that some kind of a big idea is needed to reform  to totally rethink fundraising. You know  instead of people running in this dark  trying to find their own match  who will be willing  who has the same goals. Instead of all of that we thought there is    something new needs to be invented. And we came up with this idea of issuing bonds  press freedom bonds. If there are investors willing to finance U.S. government budget deficit  why wouldn't we find investors willing to finance press freedom deficit  We've decided to do it this fall  we will issue them  probably in denominations of       dollars. I don't want to advertise them too much  that's not the point. But the point is  if we ever survive to actually issue them  find enough investors that this can be considered a success  there's nothing stopping the next organization to start to issue bonds next spring. And those can be environmental bonds. And then two weeks later  Iqbal Quadir can issue his electricity in Bangladesh bonds. And before you know it  any social cause can be actually financed in this way. Now we do daydreaming in       with    seconds left. But let's take the idea further. You do it  you start it in the States  because it's  you know  concepts are very  very close to American minds. But you can actually bring it to Europe  too. You can bring it to Asia. You can  once you have all of those different points  you can make it easy for investors. Put all of those bonds at one place and they sit down and click. Once you have more than    of them you have to develop some kind of a matrix. What do investors get  On one side financial  on the other side social. So that brings the idea of some kind of rating agency  Morningstar type. It says  you know  social impact over here is spectacular  five stars. Financial  they give you one percent  only one star. Now take it to the last step. Once you have all of that put together  there's not one reason why you couldn't actually have a marketplace for all of that  where you cannot dispose of all of those bonds in a pretty quick way. And in that way you organize the financing so there are no dark rooms  no blind people running around to find each other. Thank you. I want to start off by saying  Houston  we have a problem. We're entering a second generation of no progress in terms of human flight in space. In fact  we've regressed. We stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youth to go out and continue this very important thing that we as a species have always done. And that is  instinctively we've gone out and climbed over difficult places  went to more hostile places  and found out later  maybe to our surprise  that that's the reason we survived. And I feel very strongly that it's not good enough for us to have generations of kids that think that it's OK to look forward to a better version of a cell phone with a video in it. They need to look forward to exploration  they need to look forward to colonization  they need to look forward to breakthroughs. We need to inspire them  because they need to lead us and help us survive in the future. I'm particularly troubled that what NASA's doing right now with this new Bush doctrine to    for this next decade and a half    oh shoot  I screwed up. We have real specific instructions here not to talk about politics. What we're looking forward to is    what we're looking forward to is not only the inspiration of our children  but the current plan right now is not really even allowing the most creative people in this country    the Boeing's and Lockheed's space engineers    to go out and take risks and try new stuff. We're going to go back to the moon ...    years later  And we're going to do it very specifically planned to not learn anything new. I'm really troubled by that. But anyway that's    the basis of the thing that I want to share with you today  though  is that right back to where we inspire people who will be our great leaders later. That's the theme of my next    minutes here. And I think that the inspiration begins when you're very young  three year olds  up to         year olds. What they look at is the most important thing. Let's take a snapshot at aviation. And there was a wonderful little short four year time period when marvelous things happened. It started in       when the Wright brothers flew in Paris  and everybody said   Ooh  hey  I can do that.  There's only a few people that have flown in early     . In four years     countries had hundreds of airplanes  thousand of pilots. Airplanes were invented by natural selection. Now you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today  but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes. There were probably at least        different things tried  and when they crash and kill the pilot  don't try that again. The ones that flew and landed OK because there were no trained pilots who had good flying qualities by definition. So we  by making a whole bunch of attempts  thousands of attempts  in that four year time period  we invented the concepts of the airplanes that we fly today. And that's why they're so safe  as we gave it a lot of chance to find what's good. That has not happened at all in space flying. There's only been two concepts tried    two by the U.S. and one by the Russians. Well  who was inspired during that time period  Aviation Week asked me to make a list of who I thought were the movers and shakers of the first     years of aviation. And I wrote them down and I found out later that every one of them was a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation. Well  what happened when I was a little kid was    some pretty heavy stuff too. The jet age started  the missile age started. Von Braun was on there showing how to go to Mars    and this was before Sputnik. And this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting than it is now. We thought there'd be animals there  we knew there were plants there  the colors change  right  But  you know  NASA screwed that up because they've sent these robots and they've landed it only in the deserts. If you look at what happened    this little black line is as fast as man ever flew  and the red line is top of the line military fighters and the blue line is commercial air transport. You notice here's a big jump when I was a little kid    and I think that had something to do with giving me the courage to go out and try something that other people weren't having the courage to try. Well  what did I do when I was a kid  I didn't do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing and  well  we didn't have drugs in those days. But I did competition model airplanes. I spent about seven years during the Vietnam War flight testing airplanes for the Air Force. And then I went in and I had a lot of fun building airplanes that people could build in their garages. And some       of those are flying. Of course  one of them is around the world Voyager. I founded another company in '    which is my company now. And we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since     . And there's a lot of them that I actually can't show you on this chart. The most impressive airplane ever  I believe  was designed only a dozen years after the first operational jet. Stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly  taken out of service. We retreated in '   back to something that was developed in '  . What  The most impressive spaceship ever  I believe  was a Grumman Lunar Lander. It was a    you know  it landed on the moon  take off of the moon  didn't need any maintenance guys    that's kind of cool. We've lost that capability. We abandoned it in '  . This thing was designed three years after Gagarin first flew in space in     . Three years  and we can't do that now. Crazy. Talk very briefly about innovation cycles  things that grow  have a lot of activity  they die out when they're replaced by something else. These things tend to happen every    years.    years long  with an overlap. You can put that statement on all kinds of different technologies. The interesting thing    by the way  the speed here  excuse me  higher speed travel is the title of these innovation cycles. There is none here. These two new airplanes are the same speed as the DC  that was done in     . Here's the biggie  and that is  you don't have innovation cycles if the government develops and the government uses it. You know  a good example  of course  is the DARPA net. Computers were used for artillery first  then IRS. But when we got it  now you have all the level of activity  all the benefit from it. Private sector has to do it. Keep that in mind. I put down innovation    I've looked for innovation cycles in space  I found none. The very first year  starting when Gagarin went in space  and a few weeks later Alan Shepherd  there were five manned space flights in the world    the very first year. In       everyone that the United States sent to space was killed. There were only three or four flights in     . In       there were only two flights  two Russian Soyuz flights to the international manned station. And I had to fly three in Mojave with my little group of a couple dozen people in order to get to a total of five  which was the number the same year back in     . There is no growth. There's no activity. There's no nothing. This is a picture here taken from SpaceShipOne. This is a picture here taken from orbit. Our goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that. We know how to do it for sub orbital flying now  do it safe enough    at least as safe as the early airlines    so that can be done. And I think I want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage to go out and try that as a small company. Well  first of all  what's going to happen next  The first industry will be a high volume  a lot of players. There's another one announced just last week. And it will be sub orbital. And the reason it has to be sub orbital is  there is not solutions for adequate safety to fly the public to orbit. The governments have been doing this    three governments have been doing this for    years  and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died. That's    You don't want to run a business with that kind of a safety record. It'll be very high volume  we think         people will fly by     . I can't tell you when this will start  because I don't want my competition to know my schedule. But I think once it does  we will find solutions  and very quickly  you'll see those resort hotels in orbit. And that real easy thing to do  which is a swing around the moon so you have this cool view. And that will be really cool. Because the moon doesn't have an atmosphere    you can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by    feet if you want. Oh  it's going to be so much fun. OK. My critics say   Hey  Rutan's just spending a lot of these billionaires' money for joyrides for billionaires. What's this  This is not a transportation system  it's just for fun.  And I used to be bothered by that  and then I got to thinking  well  wait a minute. I bought my first Apple computer in      and I bought it because I could say   I got a computer at my house and you don't. 'What do you use it for ' Come over. It does Frogger.  OK. Not the bank's computer or Lockheed's computer  but the home computer was for games. For a whole decade it was for fun    we didn't even know what it was for. But what happened  the fact that we had this big industry  big development  big improvement and capability and so on  and they get out there in enough homes    we were ripe for a new invention. And the inventor is in this audience. Al Gore invented the Internet and because of that  something that we used for a whole year    excuse me    a whole decade for fun  became everything    our commerce  our research  our communication and  if we let the Google guys think for another couple weekends  we can add a dozen more things to the list.  Laughter  And it won't be very long before you won't be able to convince kids that we didn't always have computers in our homes. So fun is defendable. OK  I want to show you kind of a busy chart  but in it is my prediction with what's going to happen. And in it also brings up another point  right here. There's a group of people that have come forward    and you don't know all of them    but the ones that have come forward were inspired as young children  this little three  to    year old age  by us going to orbit and going to the moon here  right in this time period. Paul Allen  Elan Musk  Richard Branson  Jeff Bezos  the Ansari family  which is now funding the Russians' sub orbital thing  Bob Bigelow  a private space station  and Carmack. These people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area  and I think it's a lot better than they put it in an area of a better cell phone or something    but they're putting it in very    areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability  and it will lead us into the next really big thing and it will allow us to explore. And I think eventually it will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct. They were inspired by big progress. But look at the progress that's going on after that. There were a couple of examples here. The military fighters had a    highest performance military airplane was the SR  . It went a whole life cycle  got too rusty to fly  and was taken out of service. The Concorde doubled the speed for airline travel. It went a whole life cycle without competition  took out of service. And we're stuck back here with the same kind of capability for military fighters and commercial airline travel that we had back in the late '  s. But something is out there to inspire our kids now. And I'm talking about if you've got a baby now  or if you've got a    year old now. What's out there is there's something really interesting going to happen here. Relatively soon  you'll be able to buy a ticket and fly higher and faster than the highest performance military operational airplane. It's never happened before. The fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance has been  well  you know  you win the war in    minutes  why do you need something better  But I think when you guys start buying tickets and flying sub orbital flights to space  very soon    wait a minute  what's happening here  we'll have military fighters with sub orbital capability  and I think very soon this. But the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first. OK  I look forward to a new  capitalist's space race   let's call it. You remember the space race in the '  s was for national prestige  because we lost the first two milestones. We didn't lose them technically. The fact that we had the hardware to put something in orbit when we let Von Braun fly it    you can argue that's not a technical loss. Sputnik wasn't a technical loss  but it was a prestige loss. America    the world saw America as not being the leader in technology  and that was a very strong thing. And then we flew Alan Shepherd weeks after Gagarin  not months or decades  or whatever. So we had the capability. But America lost. We lost. And because of that  we made a big jump to recover it. Well  again  what's interesting here is we've lost to the Russians on the first couple of milestones already. You cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in America    can't do it. You can buy it in Russia. You can fly with Russian hardware. This is available because a Russian space program is starving  and it's nice for them to get    million here and there to take one of the seats. It's commercial. It can be defined as space tourism. They are also offering a trip to go on this whip around the moon  like Apollo   was done.     million bucks    hey  I can go to the moon. But  you know  would you have thought back in the '  s  when the space race was going on  that the first commercial capitalist like thing to do to buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in Russian hardware  And would you have thought  would the Russians have thought  that when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware  the guys inside won't be Russians  Maybe it'll probably be a Japanese or an American billionaire  Well  that's weird  you know  it really is. But anyway  I think we need to beat them again. I think what we'll do is we'll see a successful  very successful  private space flight industry. Whether we're first or not really doesn't matter. The Russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the Concorde. And then they flew a few cargo flights  and took it out of service. I think you kind of see the same kind of parallel when the commercial stuff is offered. OK  we'll talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight. This little thing says here  five times what NASA's doing by     . I want to tell you  already there's about  .  billion to  .  billion investment in private space flight that is not government at all    already  worldwide. If you read    if you Google it  you'll find about half of that money  but there's twice of that being committed out there    not spent yet  but being committed and planned for the next few years. Hey  that's pretty big. I'm predicting  though  as profitable as this industry is going to be    and it certainly is profitable when you fly people at         dollars on something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost  or less    this is going to be very profitable. I predict  also  that the investment that will flow into this will be somewhere around half of what the U.S. taxpayer spends for NASA's manned spacecraft work. And every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently by a factor of    to   . And what that means is before we know it  the progress in human space flight  with no taxpayer dollars  will be at a level of about five times as much as the current NASA budgets for human space flight. And that is because it's us. It's private industry. You should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff    and we've done it for a long time. The NACA  before NASA  never developed an airliner and never ran an airline. But NASA is developing the space liner  always has  and runs the only space line  OK. And we've shied away from it because we're afraid of it. But starting back in June of       when I showed that a little group out there actually can do it  can get a start with it  everything changed after that time. OK  thank you very much. This is me. My name is Ben Saunders. I specialize in dragging heavy things around cold places. On May   th last year  I stood alone at the North geographic Pole. I was the only human being in an area one and a half times the size of America  five and a half thousand square miles. More than       people have climbed Everest.    people have stood on the moon. Including me  only four people have skied solo to the North Pole. And I think the reason for that       thank you    I think the reason for that is that it's    it's    well  it's as Chris said  bonkers. It's a journey that is right at the limit of human capability. I skied the equivalent of    marathons back to back.     miles in    weeks. And I was dragging all the food I needed  the supplies  the equipment  sleeping bag  one change of underwear    everything I needed for nearly three months. What we're going to try and do today  in the    and a bit minutes I've got left  is to try and answer three questions. The first one is  why  The second one is  how do you go to the loo at minus      Ben  I've read somewhere that at minus     exposed skin becomes frostbitten in less than a minute  so how do you answer the call of nature   I don't want to answer these now. I'll come on to them at the end. Third one  how do you top that  What's next  It all started back in     . My first expedition was with a guy called Pen Hadow    enormously experienced chap. This was like my polar apprenticeship. We were trying to ski from this group of islands up here  Severnaya Zemlya  to the North Pole. And the thing that fascinates me about the North Pole  geographic North Pole  is that it's slap bang in the middle of the sea. This is about as good as maps get  and to reach it you've got to ski literally over the frozen crust  the floating skin of ice on the Artic Ocean. I'd spoken to all the experts. I'd read lots of books. I studied maps and charts. But I realized on the morning of day one that I had no idea exactly what I'd let myself in for. I was    years old. No one my age had attempted anything like this  and pretty quickly  almost everything that could have gone wrong did go wrong. We were attacked by a polar bear on day two. I had frostbite in my left big toe. We started running very low on food. We were both pretty hungry  losing lots of weight. Some very unusual weather conditions  very difficult ice conditions. We had decidedly low tech communications. We couldn't afford a satellite phone  so we had HF radio. You can see two ski poles sticking out of the roof of the tent. There's a wire dangling down either side. That was our HF radio antenna. We had less than two hours two way communication with the outside world in two months. Ultimately  we ran out of time. We'd skied     miles. We were just over     miles left to go to the Pole  and we'd run out of time. We were too late into the summer  the ice was starting to melt  we spoke to the Russian helicopter pilots on the radio  and they said   Look boys  you've run out of time. We've got to pick you up.  And I felt that I had failed  wholeheartedly. I was a failure. The one goal  the one dream I'd had for as long as I could remember    I hadn't even come close. And skiing along that first trip  I had two imaginary video clips that I'd replay over and over again in my mind when the going got tough  just to keep my motivation going. The first one was reaching the Pole itself. I could see vividly  I suppose  being filmed out of the door of a helicopter  there was  kind of  rock music playing in the background  and I had a ski pole with a Union Jack  you know  flying in the wind. I could see myself sticking the flag in a pole  you know    ah  glorious moment    the music kind of reaching a crescendo. The second video clip that I imagined was getting back to Heathrow airport  and I could see again  vividly  the camera flashbulbs going off  the paparazzi  the autograph hunters  the book agents coming to sign me up for a deal. And of course  neither of these things happened. We didn't get to the Pole  and we didn't have any money to pay anyone to do the PR  so no one had heard of this expedition. And I got back to Heathrow. My mum was there  my brother was there  my granddad was there    had a little Union Jack       and that was about it. I went back to live with my mum. I was physically exhausted  mentally an absolute wreck  considered myself a failure. In a huge amount of debt personally to this expedition  and lying on my mum's sofa  day in day out  watching daytime TV. My brother sent me a text message  an SMS    it was a quote from the  Simpsons.  It said   You tried your hardest and failed miserably. The lesson is  don't even try.  Fast forward three years. I did eventually get off the sofa  and start planning another expedition. This time  I wanted to go right across  on my own this time  from Russia  at the top of the map  to the North Pole  where the sort of kink in the middle is  and then on to Canada. No one has made a complete crossing of the Arctic Ocean on their own. Two Norwegians did it as a team in     . No one's done it solo. Very famous  very accomplished Italian mountaineer  Reinhold Messner  tried it in       and he was rescued after a week. He described this expedition as    times as dangerous as Everest. So for some reason  this was what I wanted to have a crack at  but I knew that even to stand a chance of getting home in one piece  let alone make it across to Canada  I had to take a radical approach. This meant everything from perfecting the sawn off  sub two gram toothbrush  to working with one of the world's leading nutritionists in developing a completely new  revolutionary nutritional strategy from scratch        calories a day. And the expedition started in February last year. Big support team. We had a film crew  a couple of logistics people with us  my girlfriend  a photographer. At first it was pretty sensible. We flew British Airways to Moscow. The next bit in Siberia to Krasnoyarsk  on a Russian internal airline called KrasAir  spelled K R A S. The next bit  we'd chartered a pretty elderly Russian plane to fly us up to a town called Khatanga  which was the sort of last bit of civilization. Our cameraman  who it turned out was a pretty nervous flier at the best of times  actually asked the pilot  before we got on the plane  how long this flight would take  and the pilot    Russian pilot    completely deadpan  replied   Six hours    if we live.  We got to Khatanga. I think the joke is that Khatanga isn't the end of the world  but you can see it from there. It was supposed to be an overnight stay. We were stuck there for    days. There was a kind of vodka fueled pay dispute between the helicopter pilots and the people that owned the helicopter  so we were stuck. We couldn't move. Finally  morning of day     we got the all clear  loaded up the helicopters    two helicopters flying in tandem    dropped me off at the edge of the pack ice. We had a frantic sort of    minutes of filming  photography  while the helicopter was still there  I did an interview on the satellite phone  and then everyone else climbed back into the helicopter  wham  the door closed  and I was alone. And I don't know if words will ever quite do that moment justice. All I could think about was running back up to the door  banging on the door  and saying   Look guys  I haven't quite thought this through.  To make things worse  you can just see the white dot up at the top right hand side of the screen  that's a full moon. Because we'd been held up in Russia  of course  the full moon brings the highest and lowest tides  when you're standing on the frozen surface of the sea  high and low tides generally mean that interesting things are going to happen    the ice is going to start moving around a bit. I was  you can see there  pulling two sledges. Grand total in all     days of food and fuel      kilos    that's almost exactly     pounds. When the ice was flat or flattish  I could just about pull both. When the ice wasn't flat  I didn't have a hope in hell. I had to pull one  leave it  and go back and get the other one. Literally scrambling through what's called pressure ice    the ice had been smashed up under the pressure of the currents of the ocean  the wind and the tides. NASA described the ice conditions last year as the worst since records began. And it's always drifting. The pack ice is always drifting. I was skiing into headwinds for nine out of the    weeks I was alone last year  and I was drifting backwards most of the time. My record was minus  .  miles. I got up in the morning  took the tent down  skied north for seven and a half hours  put the tent up  and I was two and a half miles further back than when I'd started. I literally couldn't keep up with the drift of the ice. I'm lying in the tent  getting ready to go. The weather is just appalling    oh  drifted back about five miles in the last    last night. Later in the expedition  the problem was no longer the ice. It was a lack of ice    open water. I knew this was happening. I knew the Artic was warming. I knew there was more open water. And I had a secret weapon up my sleeve. This was my little bit of bio mimicry. Polar bears on the Artic Ocean move in dead straight lines. If they come to water  they'll climb in  swim across it. So we had a dry suit developed    I worked with a team in Norway    based on a sort of survival suit    I suppose  that helicopter pilots would wear    that I could climb into. It would go on over my boots  over my mittens  it would pull up around my face   and seal pretty tightly around my face. And this meant I could ski over very thin ice  and if I fell through  it wasn't the end of the world. It also meant  if the worst came to the worst  I could actually jump in and swim across and drag the sledge over after me. Some pretty radical technology  a radical approach   but it worked perfectly. Another exciting thing we did last year was with communications technology. In       Shackleton's Endurance expedition    there was    one of his crew  a guy called Thomas Orde Lees. He said   The explorers of       if there is anything left to explore  will no doubt carry pocket wireless telephones fitted with wireless telescopes.  Well  Orde Lees guessed wrong by about eight years. This is my pocket wireless telephone  Iridium satellite phone. The wireless telescope was a digital camera I had tucked in my pocket. And every single day of the    days I was alone on the ice  I was blogging live from my tent  sending back a little diary piece  sending back information on the distance I'd covered    the ice conditions  the temperature    and a daily photo. Remember        we had less than two hours radio contact with the outside world. Last year  blogging live from an expedition that's been described as    times as dangerous as Everest. It wasn't all high tech. This is navigating in what's called a whiteout. When you get lots of mist  low cloud  the wind starts blowing the snow up. You can't see an awful lot. You can just see  there's a yellow ribbon tied to one of my ski poles. I'd navigate using the direction of the wind. So  kind of a weird combination of high tech and low tech. I got to the Pole on the   th of May. It took me    days to get there from Russia  and there is nothing there. There isn't even a pole at the Pole. There's nothing there  purely because it's sea ice. It's drifting. Stick a flag there  leave it there  pretty soon it will drift off  usually towards Canada or Greenland. I knew this  but I was expecting something. Strange mixture of feelings  it was extremely warm by this stage  a lot of open water around  and of course  elated that I'd got there under my own steam  but starting to really realize that my chances of making it all the way across to Canada  which was still     miles away  were slim at best. The only proof I've got that I was there is a blurry photo of my GPS  the little satellite navigation gadget. You can just see    there's a nine and a string of zeros here. Ninety degrees north    that is slap bang in the North Pole. I took a photo of that. Sat down on my sledge. Did a sort of video diary piece. Took a few photos. I got my satellite phone out. I warmed the battery up in my armpit. I dialed three numbers. I dialed my mum. I dialed my girlfriend. I dialed the CEO of my sponsor. And I got three voicemails. It's a special feeling. The entire planet is rotating beneath my feet. The    the whole world underneath me. I finally got through to my mum. She was at the queue of the supermarket. She started crying. She asked me to call her back. I skied on for a week past the Pole. I wanted to get as close to Canada as I could before conditions just got too dangerous to continue. This was the last day I had on the ice. When I spoke to the    my project management team  they said   Look  Ben  conditions are getting too dangerous. There are huge areas of open water just south of your position. We'd like to pick you up. Ben  could you please look for an airstrip   This was the view outside my tent when I had this fateful phone call. I'd never tried to build an airstrip before. Tony  the expedition manager  he said   Look Ben  you've got to find     meters of flat  thick safe ice.  The only bit of ice I could find    it took me    hours of skiing around trying to find an airstrip    was exactly     meters. I could measure it with my skis. I didn't tell Tony that. I didn't tell the pilots that. I thought  it'll have to do. It just about worked. A pretty dramatic landing    the plane actually passed over four times  and I was a bit worried it wasn't going to land at all. The pilot  I knew  was called Troy. I was expecting someone called Troy that did this for a living to be a pretty tough kind of guy. I was bawling my eyes out by the time the plane landed    a pretty emotional moment. So I thought  I've got to compose myself for Troy. I'm supposed to be the roughty toughty explorer type. The plane taxied up to where I was standing. The door opened. This guy jumped out. He's about that tall. He said   Hi  my name is Troy.  The co pilot was a lady called Monica. She sat there in a sort of hand knitted jumper. They were the least macho people I've ever met  but they made my day. Troy was smoking a cigarette on the ice  we took a few photos. He climbed up the ladder. He said   Just    just get in the back.  He threw his cigarette out as he got on the front  and I climbed in the back. Taxied up and down the runway a few times  just to flatten it out a bit  and he said   Right  I'm going to    I'm going to give it a go.  And he    I've now learned that this is standard practice  but it had me worried at the time. He put his hand on the throttle. You can see the control for the engines is actually on the roof of the cockpit. It's that little bar there. He put his hand on the throttle. Monica very gently put her hand sort of on top of his. I thought   God  here we go. We're  we're    this is all or nothing.  Rammed it forwards. Bounced down the runway. Just took off. One of the skis just clipped a pressure ridge at the end of the runway  banking. I could see into the cockpit  Troy battling the controls  and he just took one hand off  reached back  flipped a switch on the roof of the cockpit  and it was the  fasten seat belt  sign you can see on the wall. And only from the air did I see the big picture. Of course  when you're on the ice  you only ever see one obstacle at a time  whether it's a pressure ridge or there's a bit of water. This is probably why I didn't get into trouble about the length of my airstrip. I mean  it really was starting to break up. Why  I'm not an explorer in the traditional sense. I'm not skiing along drawing maps  everyone knows where the North Pole is. At the South Pole there's a big scientific base. There's an airstrip. There's a cafe and there's a tourist shop. For me  this is about exploring human limits  about exploring the limits of physiology  of psychology and of technology. They're the things that excite me. And it's also about potential  on a personal level. This  for me  is a chance to explore the limits    really push the limits of my own potential  see how far they stretch. And on a wider scale  it amazes me how people go through life just scratching the surface of their potential  just doing three or four or five percent of what they're truly capable of. So  on a wider scale  I hope that this journey was a chance to inspire other people to think about what they want to do with their potential  and what they want to do with the tiny amount of time we each have on this planet. That's as close as I can come to summing that up. The next question is  how do you answer the call of nature at minus     The answer  of course  to which is a trade secret    and the last question  what's next  As quickly as possible  if I have a minute left at the end  I'll go into more detail. What's next  Antarctica. It's the coldest  highest  windiest and driest continent on Earth. Late       early       there was a race to be the first to the South Pole  the heart of the Antarctic continent. If you include the coastal ice shelves  you can see that the Ross Ice Shelf    it's the big one down here    the Ross Ice Shelf is the size of France. Antarctica  if you include the ice shelves  is twice the size of Australia    it's a big place. And there's a race to get to the Pole between Amundsen  the Norwegian    Amundsen had dog sleds and huskies    and Scott  the British guy  Captain Scott. Scott had sort of ponies and some tractors and a few dogs  all of which went wrong  and Scott and his team of four people ended up on foot. They got to the Pole late January      to find a Norwegian flag already there. There was a tent  a letter to the Norwegian king. And they turned around  headed back to the coast  and all five of them died on the return journey. Since then  no one has ever skied    this was    years ago    since then  no one has ever skied from the coast of Antarctica to the Pole and back. Every South Pole expedition you may have heard about is either flown out from the Pole or has used vehicles or dogs or kites to do some kind of crossing    no one has ever made a return journey. So that's the plan. Two of us are doing it. That's pretty much it. One final thought before I get to the toilet bit  is    is  I have a    and I meant to scan this and I've forgotten    but I have a    I have a school report. I was    years old  and it's framed above my desk at home. It says   Ben lacks sufficient impetus to achieve anything worthwhile.  I think if I've learned anything  it's this  that no one else is the authority on your potential. You're the only person that decides how far you go and what you're capable of. Ladies and gentlemen  that's my story. Thank you very much. Walk around for four months with three wishes  and all the ideas will start to percolate up. I think everybody should do it    think that you've got three wishes. And what would you do  It's actually a great exercise to really drill down to the things that you feel are important  and really reflect on the world around us. And thinking that  can an individual actually do something  or come up with something  that may actually get some traction out there and make a difference  Inspired by nature    that's the theme here. And I think  quite frankly  that's where I started. I became very interested in the landscape as a Canadian. We have this Great North. And there was a pretty small population  and my father was an avid outdoorsman. So I really had a chance to experience that. And I could never really understand exactly what it was  or how it was informing me. But what I think it was telling me is that we are this transient thing that's happening  and that the nature that you see out there    the untouched shorelines  the untouched forest that I was able to see    really bring in a sense of that geological time  that this has gone on for a long time  and we're experiencing it in a different way. And that  to me  was a reference point that I think I needed to have to be able to make the work that I did. And I did go out  and I did this picture of grasses coming through in the spring  along a roadside. This rebirth of grass. And then I went out for years trying to photograph the pristine landscape. But as a fine art photographer I somehow felt that it wouldn't catch on out there  that there would be a problem with trying to make this as a fine art career. And I kept being sucked into this genre of the calendar picture  or something of that nature  and I couldn't get away from it. So I started to think of  how can I rethink the landscape  I decided to rethink the landscape as the landscape that we've transformed. I had a bit of an epiphany being lost in Pennsylvania  and I took a left turn trying to get back to the highway. And I ended up in a town called Frackville. I got out of the car  and I stood up  and it was a coal mining town. I did a     turnaround  and that became one of the most surreal landscapes I've ever seen. Totally transformed by man. And that got me to go out and look at mines like this  and go out and look at the largest industrial incursions in the landscape that I could find. And that became the baseline of what I was doing. And it also became the theme that I felt that I could hold onto  and not have to re invent myself    that this theme was large enough to become a life's work  to become something that I could sink my teeth into and just research and find out where these industries are. And I think one of the things I also wanted to say in my thanks  which I kind of missed  was to thank all the corporations who helped me get in. Because it took negotiation for almost every one of these photographs    to get into that place to make those photographs  and if it wasn't for those people letting me in at the heads of those corporations  I would have never made this body of work. So in that respect  to me  I'm not against the corporation. I own a corporation. I work with them  and I feel that we all need them and they're important. But I am also for sustainability. So there's this thing that is pulling me in both directions. And I'm not making an indictment towards what's happening here  but it is a slow progression. So I started thinking  well  we live in all these ages of man  the Stone Age  and the Iron Age  and the Copper Age. And these ages of man are still at work today. But we've become totally disconnected from them. There's something that we're not seeing there. And it's a scary thing as well. Because when we start looking at the collective appetite for our lifestyles  and what we're doing to that landscape    that  to me  is something that is a very sobering moment for me to contemplate. And through my photographs  I'm hoping to be able to engage the audiences of my work  and to come up to it and not immediately be rejected by the image. Not to say   Oh my God  what is it   but to be challenged by it    to say   Wow  this is beautiful   on one level  but on the other level   This is scary. I shouldn't be enjoying it.  Like a forbidden pleasure. And it's that forbidden pleasure that I think is what resonates out there  and it gets people to look at these things  and it gets people to enter it. And it also  in a way  defines kind of what I feel  too    that I'm drawn to have a good life. I want a house  and I want a car. But there's this consequence out there. And how do I begin to have that attraction  repulsion  It's even in my own conscience I'm having it  and here in my work  I'm trying to build that same toggle. These things that I photographed    this tire pile here had    million tires in it. It was the largest one. It was only about an hour and a half away from me  and it caught fire about four years ago. It's around Westley  California  around Modesto. And I decided to start looking at something that  to me  had    if the earlier work of looking at the landscape had a sense of lament to what we were doing to nature  in the recycling work that you're seeing here was starting to point to a direction. To me  it was our redemption. That in the recycling work that I was doing  I'm looking for a practice  a human activity that is sustainable. That if we keep putting things  through industrial and urban existence  back into the system    if we keep doing that    we can continue on. Of course  listening at the conference  there's many  many things that are coming. Bio mimicry  and there's many other things that are coming on stream    nanotechnology that may also prevent us from having to go into that landscape and tear it apart. And we all look forward to those things. But in the meantime  these things are scaling up. These things are continuing to happen. What you're looking at here    I went to Bangladesh  so I started to move away from North America  I started to look at our world globally. These images of Bangladesh came out of a radio program I was listening to. They were talking about Exxon Valdez  and that there was going to be a glut of oil tankers because of the insurance industries. And that those oil tankers needed to be decommissioned  and      was going to be the pinnacle. And I thought   My God  wouldn't that be something   To see the largest vessels of man being deconstructed by hand  literally  in third world countries. So originally I was going to go to India. And I was shut out of India because of a Greenpeace situation there  and then I was able to get into Bangladesh  and saw for the first time a third world  a view of it  that I had never actually thought was possible.     million people living in an area the size of Wisconsin    people everywhere    the pollution was intense  and the working conditions were horrible. Here you're looking at some oil fields in California  some of the biggest oil fields. And again  I started to think that    there was another epiphany    that the whole world I was living in was a result of having plentiful oil. And that  to me  was again something that I started building on  and I continued to build on. So this is a series I'm hoping to have ready in about two or three years  under the heading of  The Oil Party.  Because I think everything that we're involved in    our clothing  our cars  our roads  and everything    are directly a result. I'm going to move to some pictures of China. And for me China    I started photographing it four years ago  and China truly is a question of sustainability in my mind  not to mention that China  as well  has a great effect on the industries that I grew up around. I came out of a blue collar town  a GM town  and my father worked at GM  so I was very familiar with that kind of industry and that also informed my work. But you know  to see China and the scale at which it's evolving  is quite something. So what you see here is the Three Gorges Dam  and this is the largest dam by    percent ever attempted by man. Most of the engineers around the world left the project because they said   It's just too big.  In fact  when it did actually fill with water a year and a half ago  they were able to measure a wobble within the earth as it was spinning. It took fifteen days to fill it. So this created a reservoir     kilometers long  one of the largest reservoirs ever created. And what was also one of the bigger projects around that was moving    full size cities up out of the reservoir  and flattening all the buildings so they could make way for the ships. This is a  before and after.  So that was before. And this is like    weeks later  demolished by hand. I think    of the buildings they used dynamite  everything else was by hand. That was    weeks later. And this gives you an idea. And it was all the people who lived in those homes  were the ones that were actually taking it apart and working  and getting paid per brick to take their cities apart. And these are some of the images from that. So I spent about three trips to the Three Gorges Dam  looking at that massive transformation of a landscape. And it looks like a bombed out landscape  but it isn't. What it is  it's a landscape that is an intentional one. This is a need for power  and they're willing to go through this massive transformation  on this scale  to get that power. And again  it's actually a relief for what's going on in China because I think on the table right now  there's    nuclear power stations to be built. There hasn't been one built in North America for    years because of the  NIMBY  problem     Not In My BackYard.  But in China they're saying   No  we're putting in    in the next    years.  And coal burning furnaces are going in there for hydroelectric power literally weekly. So coal itself is probably one of the largest problems. And one of the other things that happened in the Three Gorges    a lot of the agricultural land that you see there on the left was also lost  some of the most fertile agricultural land was lost in that. And  .  to   million people were relocated  depending on whose statistics you're looking at. And this is what they were building. This is Wushan  one of the largest cities that was relocated. This is the town hall for the city. And again  the rebuilding of the city    to me  it was sad to see that they didn't really grab a lot of  I guess  what we know here  in terms of urban planning. There were no parks  there were no green spaces. Very high density living on the side of a hill. And here they had a chance to rebuild cities from the bottom up  but somehow were not connecting with them. Here is a sign that  translated  says   Obey the birth control law. Build our science  civilized and advanced idea of marriage and giving birth.  So here  if you look at this poster  it has all the trappings of Western culture. You're seeing the tuxedos  the bouquets. But what's really  to me  frightening about the picture and about this billboard is the refinery in the background. So it's like marrying up all the things that we have and it's an adaptation of our way of life  full stop. And again  when you start seeing that kind of embrace  and you start looking at them leading their rural lifestyle with a very  very small footprint and moving into an urban lifestyle with a much higher footprint  it starts to become very sobering. This is a shot in one of the biggest squares in Guangdong    and this is where a lot of migrant workers are coming in from the country. And there's about     million people in migration trying to get into urban centers at all times  and in the next    to    years  are expecting another     to     million people to migrate into the urban centers like Shanghai and the manufacturing centers. The manufacturers are    the domestics are usually    you can tell a domestic factory by the fact that they all use the same color uniforms. So this is a pink uniform at this factory. It's a shoe factory. And they have dorms for the workers. So they bring them in from the country and put them up in the dorms. This is one of the biggest shoe factories  the Yuyuan shoe factory near Shenzhen. It has        employees making shoes. This is a shift change  one of three. There's two factories of this scale in the same town. This is one with         so every lunch  there's about        coming through for lunch. They sit down  they have about    minutes. The next round comes in. It's an incredible workforce that's building there. Shanghai    I'm looking at the urban renewal in Shanghai  and this is a whole area that will be flattened and turned into skyscrapers in the next five years. What's also happening in Shanghai is    China is changing because this wouldn't have happened five years ago  for instance. This is a holdout. They're called dengzahoos    they're like pin tacks to the ground. They won't move. They're not negotiating. They're not getting enough  so they're not going to move. And so they're holding off until they get a deal with them. And they've been actually quite successful in getting better deals because most of them are getting a raw deal. They're being put out about two hours    the communities that have been around for literally hundreds of years  or maybe even thousands of years  are being broken up and spread across in the suburban areas outside of Shanghai. But these are a whole series of guys holding out in this reconstruction of Shanghai. Probably the largest urban renewal project  I think  ever attempted on the planet. And then the embrace of the things that they're replacing it with    again  one of my wishes  and I never ended up going there  was to somehow tell them that there were better ways to build a house. The kinds of collisions of styles and things were quite something  and these are called the villas. And also  like right now  they're just moving. The scaffolding is still on  and this is an e waste area  and if you looked in the foreground on the big print  you'd see that the industry    their industry    they're all recycling. So the industry's already growing around these new developments. This is a five level bridge in Shanghai. Shanghai was a very intriguing city    it's exploding on a level that I don't think any city has experienced. In fact  even Shenzhen  the economic zone    one of the first ones       years ago was about         people  and today it boasts about    to    million. So that gives you an idea of the kinds of migrations and the speed with which    this is just the taxis being built by Volkswagen. There's       of them here  and they're being built for most of the big cities  Beijing and Shanghai  Shenzhen. And this isn't even the domestic car market  this is the taxi market. And what we would see here as a suburban development    a similar thing  but they're all high rises. So they'll put    or    up at a time  and they just go up in the same way as a single family dwelling would go up here in an area. And the density is quite incredible. And one of the things in this picture that I wanted to point out is that when I saw these kinds of buildings  I was shocked to see that they're not using a central air conditioning system  every window has an air conditioner in it. And I'm sure there are people here who probably know better than I do about efficiencies  but I can't imagine that every apartment having its own air conditioner is a very efficient way to cool a building on this scale. And when you start looking at that  and then you start factoring up into a city the size of Shanghai  it's literally a forest of skyscrapers. It's breathtaking  in terms of the speed at which this city is transforming. And you can see in the foreground of this picture  it's still one of the last areas that was being held up. Right now that's all cleared out    this was done about eight months ago    and high rises are now going up into that central spot. So a skyscraper is built  literally  overnight in Shanghai. Most recently I went in  and I started looking at some of the biggest industries in China. And this is Baosteel  right outside of Shanghai. This is the coal supply for the steel factory       square kilometers. It's an incredibly massive operation  I think        workers  five cupolas  and the sixth one's coming in here. So they're building very large blast furnaces to try to deal with the demand for steel in China. So this is three of the visible blast furnaces within that shot. And again  looking at these images  there's this constant  like  haze that you're seeing. This is going to show you  real time  an assembler. It's a circuit breaker.    hours a day at this speed. I think one of the issues that we here are facing with China  is that they're using a lot of the latest production technology. In that one  there were     people that worked on the floor. And I asked the manager to point out five of your fastest producers  and then I went and looked at each one of them for about    or    minutes  and picked this one woman. And it was just lightning fast  the way she was working was almost unbelievable. But that is the trick that they've got right now  that they're winning with  is that they're using all the latest technologies and extrusion machines  and bringing all the components into play  but the assembly is where they're actually bringing in    the country workers are very willing to work. They want to work. There's a massive backlog of people wanting their jobs. That condition's going to be there for the next    to    years if they realize what they want  which is  you know      to     million more people coming into the cities. In this particular case    this is the assembly line that you saw  this is a shot of it. I had to use a very small aperture to get the depth of field. I had to have them freeze for    seconds to get this shot. It took me five fake tries because they were just going. To slow them down was literally impossible. They were just wound up doing these things all day long  until the manager had to  with a stern voice  say   Okay  everybody freeze.  It wasn't too bad  but they're driven to produce these things at an incredible rate. This is a textile mill doing synthetic silk  an oil byproduct. And what you're seeing here is  again  one of the most state of the art textile mills. There are     of these machines  they're worth about         dollars each. So you have about    people running this  and they're just inspecting it    and they're just walking the lines. The machines are all running  absolutely incredible to see what the scale of industries are. And I started getting in further and further into the factories. And that's a diptych. I do a lot of pairings to try and get the sense of scale in these places. This is a line where they get the threads and they wind the threads together  pre going into the textile mills. Here's something that's far more labor intensive  which is the making of shoes. This floor has about       workers on this floor. The company itself had about        employees  and they're doing domestic shoes. It was very hard to get into the international companies because I had to get permission from companies like Nike and Adidas  and that's very hard to get. And they don't want to let me in. But the domestic was much easier to do. It just gives you a sense of  again    and that's where  really  the whole migration of jobs started going over to China and making the shoes. Nike was one of the early ones. It was such a high labor component to it that it made a lot of sense to go after that labor market. This is a high tech mobile phone  Bird mobile phone  one of the largest mobile makers in China. I think mobile phone companies are popping up  literally  on a weekly basis  and they have an explosive growth in mobile phones. This is a textile where they're doing shirts    Youngor  the biggest shirt factory and clothing factory in China. And this next shot here is one of the lunchrooms. Everything is very efficient. While setting up this shot  people on average would spend eight to    minutes having a lunch. This was one of the biggest factories I've ever seen. They make coffeemakers here  the biggest coffeemaker and the biggest iron makers    they make    million of them in the world. There's        employees. This one factory    and they had several of them    is half a kilometer long. These are just recently shot    I just came back about a month ago  so you're the first ones to be seeing these  these new factory pictures I've taken. So it's taken me almost a year to gain access into these places. The other aspect of what's happening in China is that there's a real need for materials there. So a lot of the recycled materials that are collected here are being recycled and taken to China by ships. That's cubed metal. This is armatures  electrical armatures  where they're getting the copper and the high end steel from electrical motors out  and recycling them. This is certainly connected to California and Silicon Valley. But this is what happens to most of the computers. Fifty percent of the world's computers end up in China to be recycled. It's referred to as  e waste  there. And it is a bit of a problem. The way they recycle the boards is that they actually use the coal briquettes  which are used all through China  but they heat up the boards  and with pairs of pliers they pull off all the components. They're trying to get all the valued metals out of those components. But the toxic smells    when you come into a town that's actually doing this kind of burning of the boards  you can smell it a good five or    kilometers before you get there. Here's another operation. It's all cottage industries  so it's not big places    it's all in people's front porches  in their backyards  even in their homes they're burning boards  if there's a concern for somebody coming by    because it is considered in China to be illegal  doing it  but they can't stop the product from coming in. This portrait    I'm not usually known for portraits  but I couldn't resist this one  where she's been through Mao  and she's been through the Great Leap Forward  and the Cultural Revolution  and now she's sitting on her porch with this e waste beside her. It's quite something. This is a road where it's been shored up by computer boards in one of the biggest towns where they're recycling. So that's the photographs that I wanted to show you. I want to dedicate my wishes to my two girls. They've been sitting on my shoulder the whole time while I've been thinking. One's Megan  the one of the right  and Katja there. And to me the whole notion    the things I'm photographing are out of a great concern about the scale of our progress and what we call progress. And as much as there are great things around the corner    and it's palpable in this room    of all of the things that are just about to break that can solve so many problems  I'm really hoping that those things will spread around the world and will start to have a positive effect. And it isn't something that isn't just affecting our world  but it starts to go up    because I think we can start correcting our footprint and bring it down    but there's a growing footprint that's happening in Asia  and is growing at a rapid  rapid rate  and so I don't think we can equalize it. So ultimately the strategy  I think  here is that we have to be very concerned about their evolution  because it is going to be connected to our evolution as well. So part of my thinking  and part of my wishes  is sitting with these thoughts in mind  and thinking about   How is their life going to be when they want to have children  or when they're ready to get married    years from now    or whatever     years from now   And to me that has been the core behind most of my thinking    in my work  and also for this incredible chance to have some wishes. Wish one  world changing. I want to use my images to persuade millions of people to join in the global conversation on sustainability. And it is through communications today that I believe that that is not an unreal idea. Oh  and I went in search    I wanted to put what I had in mind  hitch it onto something. I didn't want a wish just to start from nowhere. One of them I'm starting from almost nothing  but the other one  I wanted to find out what's going on that's working right now. And Worldchanging.com is a fantastic blog  and that blog is now being visited by close to half a million people a month. And it just started about    months ago. And the beauty of what's going on there is that the tone of the conversation is the tone that I like. What they're doing there is that they're not    I think the environmental movement has failed in that it's used the stick too much  it's used the apocalyptic tone too much  it hasn't sold the positive aspects of being environmentally concerned and trying to pull us out. Whereas this conversation that is going on in this blog is about positive movements  about how to change our world in a better way  quickly. And it's looking at technology  and it's looking at new energy saving devices  and it's looking at how to rethink and how to re strategize the movement towards sustainability. And so for me  one of the things that I thought would be to put some of my work in the service of promoting the Worldchanging.com website. Some of you might know  he's a TEDster    Stephen Sagmeister and I are working on some layouts. And this is still in preliminary stages  these aren't the finals. But these images  with Worldchanging.com  can be placed into any kind of media. They could be posted through the Web  they could be used as a billboard or a bus shelter  or anything of that nature. So we're looking at this as trying to build out. And what we ended up discussing was that in most media you get mostly an image with a lot of text  and the text is blasted all over. What was unusual  according to Stephen  is less than five percent of ads are actually leading with image. And so in this case  because it's about a lot of these images and what they represent  and the kinds of questions they bring up  that we thought letting the images play out and bring someone to say   Well  what's Worldchanging.com  with these images  have to do   And hopefully inspire people to go to that website. So Worldchanging.com  and building that blog  and it is a blog  and I'm hoping that it isn't    I don't see it as the kind of blog where we're all going to follow each other to death. This one is one that will spoke out  and will go out  and to start reaching. Because right now there's conversations in India  in China  in South America    there's entries coming from all around the world. I think there's a chance to have a dialogue  a conversation about sustainability at Worldchanging.com. And anything that you can do to promote that would be fantastic. Wish two is more of the bottom up  ground up one that I'm trying to work with. And this one is  I wish to launch a groundbreaking competition that motivates kids to invest ideas on  and invent ideas on  sustainability. And one of the things that came out    Allison  who actually nominated me  said something earlier on in a brainstorming. She said that recycling in Canada had a fantastic entry into our psyche through kids between grade four and six. And you think about it  you know  grade four    my wife and I  we say age seven is the age of reason  so they're into the age of reason. And they're pre puberty. So it's this great window where they actually are    you can influence them. You know what happens at puberty  You know  we know that from earlier presentations. So my thinking here is that we try to motivate those kids to start driving home ideas. Let them understand what sustainability is  and that they have a vested interest in it to happen. And one of the ways I thought of doing it is to use my prize  so I would take        or        dollars of the winnings  and the rest is going to be to manage this project  but to use that as prizes for kids to get into their hands. But the other thing that I thought would be fantastic was to create these    call them  prize targets.  And so one could be for the best sustainable idea for an in school project  the best one for a household project  or it could be the best community project for sustainability. And I also thought there should be a nice prize for the best artwork for  In My World.  And what would happen    it's a scalable thing. And if we can get people to put in things    whether it's equipment  like a media lab  or money to make the prize significant enough    and to open it up to all the schools that are public schools  or schools that are with kids that age  and make it a wide open competition for them to go after those prizes and to submit them. And the prize has to be a verifiable thing  so it's not about just ideas. The art pieces are about the ideas and how they present them and do them  but the actual things have to be verifiable. In that way  what's happening is that we're motivating a certain age group to start thinking. And they're going to push that up  from the bottom    up into  I believe  into the households. And parents will be reacting to it  and trying to help them with the projects. And I think it starts to motivate the whole idea towards sustainability in a very positive way  and starts to teach them. They know about recycling now  but they don't really  I think  get sustainability in all the things  and the energy footprint  and how that matters. And to teach them  to me  would be a fantastic wish  and it would be something that I would certainly put my shoulder into. And again  in  In My World   the competition    we would use the artwork that comes in from that competition to promote it. And I like the words   in my world   because it gives possession of the world to the person who's doing it. It is my world  it's not someone else's. I want to help it  I want to do something with it. So I think it has a great opportunity to engage the imaginations    and great ideas  I think  come from kids    and engage their imagination into a project  and do something for schools. I think all schools could use extra equipment  extra cash    it's going to be an incentive for them to do that. And these are some of the ideas in terms of where we could possibly put in some promotion for  In My World.  And wish three is  Imax film. So I was told I should do one for myself  and I've always wanted to actually get involved with doing something. And the scale of my work  and the kinds of ideas I'm playing with    when I first saw an Imax film  I almost immediately thought   There's a real resonance between what I'm trying to do and the scale of what I try to do as a photographer.  And I think there's a real possibility to reach new audiences if I had a chance. So I'm looking  really  for a mentor  because I just had my birthday. I'm     and I don't have time to go back to school right now    I'm too busy. So I need somebody who can put me on a quick catch up course on how to do something like that  and lead me through the maze of how one does something like this. That would be fantastic. So those are my three wishes. I'm going to discuss with you three of my inventions that can have an effect on    to a     million people  which we will hope to see happen. We discussed  in the prior film  some of the old things that we did  like stents and insulin pumps for the diabetic. And I'd like to talk very briefly about three new inventions that will change the lives of many people. At the present time  it takes an average of three hours after the first symptoms of a heart attack are recognized by the patient  before that patient arrives at an emergency room. And people with silent ischemia    which  translated into English  means they don't have any symptoms    it takes even longer for them to get to the hospital. The AMI  Acute Myocardial Infarction  which is a doctor's big word so they can charge you more money       means a heart attack. Annual incidence   .  million Americans. Mortality          people dying each year. About half of them           have permanent damage to their heart that will cause them to have very bad problems later on. Thus         people either have died or have significant damage to their heart muscle. Symptoms are often denied by the patient  particularly us men  because we are very brave. We are very brave  and we don't want to admit that I'm having a hell of a chest pain. Then  approximately    percent of all patients never have any symptoms. What are we going to do about them  How can we save their lives  It's particularly true of diabetics and elderly women. Well  what is needed for the earliest possible warning of a heart attack  A means to determine if there's a complete blockage of a coronary artery. That  ladies and gentlemen  is a heart attack. The means consist of noting something a little technical  ST segment elevation of the electrogram    translated into English  that means that if there's an electrical signal in the heart  and one part of the ECG    which we call the ST segment    elevates  that is a sure sign of a heart attack. And if we had a computer put into the body of a person who's at risk  we could know  before they even have symptoms  that they're having a heart attack  to save their life. Well  the doctor can program a level of this ST elevation voltage that will trigger an emergency alarm  vibration like your cell phone  but right by your clavicle bone. And when it goes beep  beep  beep  you better do something about it  because if you want to live you have to get to some medical treatment. So we have to try these devices out because the FDA won't just let us use them on people unless we try it out first  and the best model for this happens to be pigs. And what we tried with the pig was external electrodes on the skin  like you see in an emergency room  and I'm going to show you why they don't work very well. And then we put a lead  which is a wire  in the right ventricle inside the heart  which does the electrogram  which is the signal voltage from inside the heart. Well  with the pig  at the baseline  before we blocked the pig's artery to simulate a heart attack  that was the signal. After    seconds  even an expert couldn't tell the difference  and after three minutes    well  if you really studied it  you'd see a difference. But what happened when we looked inside the pig's heart  to the electrogram  There was the baseline    first of all  a much bigger and more reliable signal. Second of all  I'll bet even you people who are untrained can see the difference  and we see here an ST segment elevation right after this sharp line. Look at the difference there. It doesn't take much    every layperson could see that difference  and computers can be programmed to easily detect it. Then  look at that after three minutes. We see that the signal that's actually in the heart  we can use it to tell people that they're having a heart attack even before they have symptoms so we can save their life. Then we tried it with my son  Dr. Tim Fischell  we tried it on some human patients who had to have a stent put in. Well  he kept the balloon filled to block the artery  to simulate a blockage  which is what a heart attack is. And it's not hard to see that    the baseline is the first picture on the upper left. Next to it  at    seconds  you see this rise here  then this rise    that's the ST elevation. And if we had a computer that could detect it  we could tell you you're having a heart attack so early it could save your life and prevent congestive heart failure. And then he did it again. We filled the balloon again a few minutes later and here you see  even after    seconds  a great rise in this piece  which we can have computers inside  under your chest like a pacemaker  with a wire into your heart like a pacemaker. And computers don't go to sleep. We have a little battery and on this little battery that computer will run for five years without needing replacement. What does the system look like  Well  on the left is the IMD  which is Implantable Medical Device  and tonight in the tent you can see it    they've exhibited it. It's about this big  the size of a pacemaker. It's implanted with very conventional techniques. And the EXD is an External Device that you can have on your night table. It'll wake you up and tell you to get your tail to the emergency room when the thing goes off because  if you don't  you're in deep doo doo. And then  finally  a programmer that will set the level of the stimulation  which is the level which says you are having a heart attack. The FDA says  OK  test this final device after it's built in some animal  which we said is a pig  so we had to get this pig to have a heart attack. And when you go to the farmyard  you can't easily get pigs to have heart attacks  so we said  well  we're experts in stents. Tonight you'll see some of our invented stents. We said  so we'll put in a stent  but we're not going to put in a stent that we'd put in people. We're putting in a copper stent  and this copper stent erodes the artery and causes heart attacks. That's not very nice  but  after all  we had to find out what the answer is. So we took two copper stents and we put it in the artery of this pig  and let me show you the result that's very gratifying as far as people who have heart disease are concerned. So there it was  Thursday morning we stopped the pig's medication and there is his electrogram  the signal from inside the pig's heart coming out by radio telemetry. Then  on Friday at       he began to get certain signs  which later we had the pig run around    I'm not going to go into this early stage. But look what happened at       after we removed this pig's medication that kept him from having a heart attack. Any one of you now is an expert on ST elevation. Can you see it there  Can you see it in the picture after the big rise of the QRS    you see ST elevation  This pig at       was having a heart attack. What happens after you have the heart attack  this blockage  Your rhythm becomes irregular  and that's what happened    minutes later. Then  ventricular fibrillation  the heart quivers instead of beats    this is just before death of the pig    and then the pig died  it went flat line. But we had a little bit over an hour where we could've saved this pig's life. Well  because of the FDA  we didn't save the pig's life  because we need to do this type of animal research for humans. But when it comes to the sake of a human  we can save their life. We can save the lives of people who are at high risk for a heart attack. What is the response to acute myocardial infarction  a heart attack  today  Well  you feel some chest pain or indigestion. It's not all that bad  you decide not to do anything. Several hours pass and it gets worse  and even the man won't ignore it. Finally  you go to the emergency room. You wait as burns and other critical patients are treated  because    percent of the patients who go to an emergency room with chest pains don't have AMI  so you're not taken very seriously. They finally see you. It takes more time to get your electrocardiogram on your skin and diagnose it  and it's hard to do because they don't have the baseline data  which the computer we put in you gets. Finally  if you're lucky  you are treated in three or four hours after the incident  but the heart muscle has died. And that is the typical treatment in the advanced world    not Africa    that's the typical treatment in the advanced world today. So we developed the AngelMed Guardian System and we have a device inside this patient  called the Implanted AngelMed Guardian. And when you have a blockage  the alarm goes off and it sends the alarm and the electrogram to an external device  which gets your baseline electrogram from    hours ago and the one that caused the alarm  so you can take it to the emergency room and show them  and say  take care of me right away. Then it goes to a network operations center  where they get your data from your patient database that's been put in at some central location  say  in the United States. Then it goes to a diagnostic center  and within one minute of your heart attack  your signal appears on the screen of a computer and the computer analyzes what your problem is. And the person who's there  the medical practitioner  calls you    this is also a cell phone    and says   Mr. Smith  you're in deep doo doo  you have a problem. We've called the ambulance. The ambulance is on the way. It'll pick you up  and then we're going to call your doctor  tell him about it. We're going to send him the signal that we have  that says you have a heart attack  and we're going to send the signal to the hospital and we're going to have it analyzed there  and there you're going to be with your doctor and you'll be taken care of so you won't die of a heart attack.  That's the first invention that I wanted to describe. And now I want to talk about something entirely different. At first I didn't think migraine headaches were a big problem because I'd never had a migraine headache  but then I spoke to some people who have three or four every week of their life  and their lives are being totally ruined by it. We have a mission statement for our company doing migraine  which is   Prevent or ameliorate migraine headaches by the application of a safe  controlled magnetic pulse applied  as needed  by the patient.  Now  you're probably very few physicists here. If you're a physicist you'd know there's a certain Faraday's Law  which says if I apply a magnetic pulse on salt water    that's your brains by the way    it'll generate electric currents  and the electric current in the brain can erase a migraine headache. That's what we have discovered. So here's a picture of what we're doing. The patients who have a migraine preceded by an aura have a band of excited neurons    that's shown in red    that moves at three to five millimeters a minute towards the mid brain. And when it hits the mid brain  that's when the headache begins. There's this migraine that is preceded by a visual aura  and this visual aura  by the way    and I'll show you a picture    but it sort of begins with little dancing lights  gets bigger and bigger until it fills your whole visual field. And what we tried was this  here is a device called the Cadwell Model MES  . Weighs about    pounds  has a wire about an inch in diameter. And here's one of the patients who has an aura and always has a headache  bad one  after the aura. What do we do  This is what an aura looks like. It's sort of funny dancing lights  shown there on the left and right side. And that's a fully developed visual aura  as we see on top. In the middle  our experimentalist  the neurologist  who said   I'm going to move this down a little and I'm going to erase half your aura.  And  by God  the neurologist did erase it  and that's the middle picture  half of the aura erased by a short magnetic pulse. What does that mean  That means that the magnetic pulse is generating an electric current that's interfering with the erroneous electrical activity in the brain. And finally he says   OK  now I'm going to      all of the aura get erased with an appropriately placed magnetic pulse. What is the result  We designed a magnetic depolarizer that looks like this  that you could have    a lady  in her pocket book    and when you get an aura you can try it and see how it works. Well  the next thing they have to show is what was on ABC News  Channel    last week in New York City  in the    o'clock news. Anchor  For anyone who suffers from migraine headaches    and there are    million Americans who do    tonight  a possible answer. Eyewitness news reporter Stacy Sager tonight  with a small and portable machine that literally zaps your migraines away. Christina Sidebottom  Well  my first reaction was that it was    looked awfully gun like  and it was very strange. Stacy Sager  But for Christina Sidebottom  almost anything was worth trying if it could stop a migraine. It may look silly or even frightening as you walk around with it in your purse  but researchers here in Ohio organizing clinical trials for this migraine zapper  say it is scientifically sound    that  in fact  when the average person gets a migraine  it's caused by something similar to an electrical impulse. The zapper creates a magnetic field to counteract that. Yousef Mohammed  In other words  we're treating electricity with electricity  rather than treating electricity with the chemicals that we're using nowadays. SS  But is it safe to use everyday  Experts say the research has actually been around for more than a decade  and more long term studies need to be done. Christina now swears by it. CS  It's been the most wonderful thing for my migraine. SS  Researchers are hoping to present their studies to the FDA this summer. Robert Fischell  And that is the invention to treat migraines. You see  the problem is     million Americans have migraine headaches  and we need a means to treat it  and I think that we now have it. And this is the first device that we did  and I'm going to talk about my second wish  which has something to do with this. Our conclusions from our studies so far  at three research centers  is there is a marked improvement in pain levels after using it just once. The most severe headaches responded better after we did it several times  and the unexpected finding indicates that even established headaches  not only those with aura  get treated and get diminished. And auras can be erased and the migraine  then  does not occur. And that is the migraine invention that we are talking about and that we are working on. The third and last invention began with an idea. Epilepsy can best be treated by responsive electrical stimulation. Now  why do we use    add on  nearly  an epileptic focus  Now  unfortunately  us technical people  unlike Mr. Bono  have to get into all these technical words. Well   responsive electrical stimulation  means that we sense  at a place in your brain which is called an  epileptic focus   which is where the epileptic seizure begins    we sense there  that it's going to happen  and then we respond by applying an electrical energy at that spot  which erases the errant signal so that you don't get the clinical manifestations of the migraine headache. We use current pacemaker defibrillator technology that's used for the heart. We thought we could adapt it for the brain. The device could be implanted under the scalp to be totally hidden and avoid wire breakage  which occurs if you put it in the chest and you try to move your neck around. Form a company to develop a neuro pacemaker for epilepsy  as well as other diseases of the brain  because all diseases of the brain are a result of some electrical malfunction in it  that causes many  if not all  of brain disorders. We formed a company called NeuroPace and we started work on responsive neurostimulation  and this is a picture of what the device looked like  that's placed into the cranial bone. This is probably a better picture. Here we have our device in which we put in a frame. There's a cut made in the scalp  it's opened  the neurosurgeon has a template  he marks it around  and uses a dental burr to remove a piece of the cranial bone exactly the size of our device. And tonight  you'll be able to see the device in the tent. And then with four screws  we put in a frame  then we snap in the device and we run with wires    the one shown in green will go to the surface of the brain with electrodes  to the epileptic focus  the origin of the epilepsy  where we can sense the electrical signal and have computer analysis that tells us when to hit it with some electrical current to prevent the clinical manifestation of the seizure. In the blue wire  we see what's called a deep brain electrode. If that's the source of the epilepsy  we can attack that as well. The comprehensive solution  this is the device  it's about one inches by two inches and  oddly enough  just the thickness of most cranial bones. The advantages of responsive neurostimulation  It can detect and terminate seizures before the clinical symptoms occur  provide stimulation only when needed  can be turned off if seizures disappear  it has minimal side effects    as a matter of fact  in all our clinical trials to date  we've seen no side effects in the    or so patients in whom it's been implanted    and it's invisible  cosmetically hidden  so  if you have epilepsy and you have the device  no one will know it because you can't tell that it's there. And this shows what an electroencephalogram is  and on the left is the signal of a spontaneous seizure of one of the patients. Then we stimulated  and you see how that heavy black line and then you see the electroencephalogram signal going to normal  which means they did not get the epileptic seizure. That concludes my discussion of epilepsy  which is the third invention that I want to discuss here this afternoon. I have three wishes. Well  I can't do much about Africa. I'm a tech  I'm into medical gadgetry  which is mostly high tech stuff like Mr. Bono talked about. The first wish is to use the epilepsy responsive neurostimulator  called RNS  for Responsive NeuroStimulator    that's a brilliant acronym    for the treatment of other brain disorders. Well  if we're going to do it for epilepsy  why the hell not try it for something else  Then you saw what that device looked like  that the woman was using to fix her migraines  I tell you this  that's something which some research engineer like me would concoct  not a real designer of good equipment. We want to have some people  who really know how to do this  perform human engineering studies to develop the optimum design for the portable device for treating migraine headaches. And some of the sponsors of this TED meeting are such organizations. Then we're going to challenge the TED attendees to come up with a way to improve health care in the USA  where we have problems that Africa doesn't have. And by reducing malpractice litigation    malpractice litigation is not an African problem  it's an American problem. So  to get quickly to my first wish    the brain operates by electrical signals. If the electrical signals create a brain disorder  electro stimulation can overcome that disorder by acting on the brain's neurons. In other words  if you've screwed up electrical signals  maybe  by putting other electrical signals from a computer in the brain  we can counteract that. A signal in the brain that triggers brain dysfunction might be sensed as a trigger for electro stimulation like we're doing with epilepsy. But even if there is no signal  electro stimulation of an appropriate part of the brain can turn off a brain disorder. And consider treating psychotic disorders    and I want this involved with the TED group    such as obsessive compulsive disorder that  presently  is not well treated with drugs  and includes five million Americans. And Mr. Fischer  and his group at NeuroPace  and myself believe that we can have a dramatic effect in improving OCD in America and in the world. That is the first wish. The second wish is  at the present time  the clinical trials of transcranial magnetic stimulators    that's what TMS means  device to treat migraine headaches    appears to be quite successful. Well  that's the good news. The present portable device is far from optimally designed  both as to human factors as appearance. I think she said it looks like a gun. A lot of people don't like guns. Engage a company having prior successes for human factors engineering and industrial design to optimize the design of the first portable TMS device that will be sold to the patients who have migraine headaches. And that is the second wish. And  of the         dollar prize money  that TED was so generous to give me  I am donating        dollars to the NeuroPace people to get on with the treatment of OCD  obsessive compulsive disorder  and I'm making another        available for a company to optimize the design of the device for migraines. And that's how I'll use my         dollar prize money. Well  the third and final wish is somewhat    unfortunately  it's much more complicated because it involves lawyers. Well  medical malpractice litigation in the US has escalated the cost of malpractice insurance  so that competent physicians are leaving their practice. Lawyers take cases on contingency with the hope of a big share of a big settlement by a sympathetic jury  because this patient really ended up badly. The high cost of health care in the US is partly due to litigation and insurance costs. I've seen pictures  graphs in today's USA Today showing it skyrocketing out of control  and this is one factor. Well  how can the TED community help with this situation  I have a couple of ideas to begin with. As a starting point for discussion with the TED group  a major part of the problem is the nature of the written extent of informed consent that the patient or spouse must read and sign. For example  I asked the epilepsy people what are they using for informed consent. Would you believe     pages  single space  the patient has to read before they're in our trial to cure their epilepsy  What do you think someone has at the end of reading    single spaced pages  They don't understand what the hell it's about. That's the present system. How about making a video  We have entertainment people here  we have people who know how to do videos  with visual presentation of the anatomy and procedure done with animation. Everybody knows that we can do better with a visual thing that can be interactive with the patient  where they see the video and they're being videoed and they press  do you understand this  No  I don't. Well  then let's go to a simpler explanation. Then there's a simpler one and  oh yes  I understand that. Well  press the button and you're on record  you understand. And that is one of the ideas. Now  also a video is done of the patient or spouse and medical presenter  with the patient agreeing that he understands the procedure to be done  including all the possible failure modes. The patient or spouse agrees not to file a lawsuit if one of the known procedure failures occurs. Now  in America  in fact  you cannot give up your right to trial by jury. However  if a video is there that everything was explained to you  and you have it all in the video file  it'll be much less likely that some hotshot lawyer will take this case on contingency  because it won't be nearly as good a case. If a medical error occurs  the patient or spouse agrees to a settlement for fair compensation by arbitration instead of going to court. That would save hundreds of millions of dollars in legal costs in the United States and would decrease the cost of medicine for everyone. These are just some starting points. And  so there  that's the end of all my wishes. I wish I had more wishes but three is what I've got and there they are. Well  as Alexander Graham Bell famously said on his first successful telephone call   Hello  is that Domino's Pizza   I just really want to thank you very much. As another famous man  Jerry Garcia  said   What a strange  long trip.  And he should have said   What a strange  long trip it's about to become.  At this very moment  you are viewing my upper half. My lower half is appearing at a different conference in a different country. You can  it turns out  be in two places at once. But still  I'm sorry I can't be with you in person. I'll explain at another time. And though I'm a rock star  I just want to assure you that none of my wishes will include a hot tub. But what really turns me on about technology is not just the ability to get more songs on MP  players. The revolution    this revolution    is much bigger than that. I hope  I believe. What turns me on about the digital age  what excites me personally  is that you have closed the gap between dreaming and doing. You see  it used to be that if you wanted to make a record of a song  you needed a studio and a producer. Now  you need a laptop. If you wanted to make a film  you needed a mass of equipment and a Hollywood budget. Now  you need a camera that fits in your palm  and a couple of bucks for a blank DVD. Imagination has been decoupled from the old constraints. And that really  really excites me. I'm excited when I glimpse that kind of thinking writ large. What I would like to see is idealism decoupled from all constraints. Political  economic  psychological  whatever. The geopolitical world has got a lot to learn from the digital world. From the ease with which you swept away obstacles that no one knew could even be budged. And that's actually what I'd like to talk about today. First  though  I should probably explain why  and how  I got to this place. It's a journey that started    years ago. You may remember that song   We Are the World   or   Do They Know It's Christmas   Band Aid  Live Aid. Another very tall  grizzled rock star  my friend Sir Bob Geldof  issued a challenge to  feed the world.  It was a great moment  and it utterly changed my life. That summer  my wife  Ali  and myself went to Ethiopia. We went on the quiet to see for ourselves what was going on. We lived in Ethiopia for a month  working at an orphanage. The children had a name for me. They called me   The girl with the beard.  Don't ask. Anyway  we found Africa to be a magical place. Big skies  big hearts  big  shining continent. Beautiful  royal people. Anybody who ever gave anything to Africa got a lot more back. Ethiopia didn't just blow my mind  it opened my mind. Anyway  on our last day at this orphanage a man handed me his baby and said   Would you take my son with you   He knew  in Ireland  that his son would live  and that in Ethiopia  his son would die. It was the middle of that awful famine. Well  I turned him down. And it was a funny kind of sick feeling  but I turned him down. And it's a feeling I can't ever quite forget. And in that moment  I started this journey. In that moment  I became the worst thing of all  I became a rock star with a cause.  Laughter  Except this isn't the cause  is it  Six and a half thousand Africans dying every single day from AIDS    a preventable  treatable disease    for lack of drugs we can get in any pharmacy. That's not a cause. That's an emergency.    million AIDS orphans in Africa     million by the end of the decade. That's not a cause. That's an emergency. Today  every day        more Africans will catch HIV because of stigmatization and lack of education. That's not a cause. That's an emergency. So what we're talking about here is human rights. The right to live like a human. The right to live  period. And what we're facing in Africa is an unprecedented threat to human dignity and equality. The next thing I'd like to be clear about is what this problem is  and what this problem isn't. Because this is not all about charity. This is about justice. Really. This is not about charity. This is about justice. That's right. And that's too bad  because we're very good at charity. Americans  like Irish people  are good at it. Even the poorest neighborhoods give more than they can afford. We like to give  and we give a lot. Look at the response to the tsunami    it's inspiring. But justice is a tougher standard than charity. You see  Africa makes a fool of our idea of justice. It makes a farce of our idea of equality. It mocks our pieties. It doubts our concern. It questions our commitment. Because there is no way we can look at what's happening in Africa  and if we're honest  conclude that it would ever be allowed to happen anywhere else. As you heard in the film  anywhere else  not here. Not here  not in America  not in Europe. In fact  a head of state that you're all familiar with admitted this to me. And it's really true. There is no chance this kind of hemorrhaging of human life would be accepted anywhere else other than Africa. Africa is a continent in flames. And deep down  if we really accepted that Africans were equal to us  we would all do more to put the fire out. We're standing around with watering cans  when what we really need is the fire brigade. You see  it's not as dramatic as the tsunami. It's crazy  really  when you think about it. Does stuff have to look like an action movie these days to exist in the front of our brain  The slow extinguishing of countless lives is just not dramatic enough  it would appear. Catastrophes that we can avert are not as interesting as ones we could avert. Funny  that. Anyway  I believe that that kind of thinking offends the intellectual rigor in this room. Six and a half thousand people dying a day in Africa may be Africa's crisis  but the fact that it's not on the nightly news  that we in Europe  or you in America  are not treating it like an emergency    I want to argue with you tonight that that's our crisis. I want to argue that though Africa is not the front line in the war against terror  it could be soon. Every week  religious extremists take another African village. They're attempting to bring order to chaos. Well  why aren't we  Poverty breeds despair. We know this. Despair breeds violence. We know this. In turbulent times  isn't it cheaper  and smarter  to make friends out of potential enemies than to defend yourself against them later   The war against terror is bound up in the war against poverty.  And I didn't say that. Colin Powell said that. Now when the military are telling us that this is a war that cannot be won by military might alone  maybe we should listen. There's an opportunity here  and it's real. It's not spin. It's not wishful thinking. The problems facing the developing world afford us in the developed world a chance to re describe ourselves to the world. We will not only transform other people's lives  but we will also transform the way those other lives see us. And that might be smart in these nervous  dangerous times. Don't you think that on a purely commercial level  that anti retroviral drugs are great advertisements for Western ingenuity and technology  Doesn't compassion look well on us  And let's cut the crap for a second. In certain quarters of the world  brand EU  brand USA  is not at its shiniest. The neon sign is fizzing and cracking. Someone's put a brick through the window. The regional branch managers are getting nervous. Never before have we in the west been so scrutinized. Our values  do we have any  Our credibility  These things are under attack around the world. Brand USA could use some polishing. And I say that as a fan  you know  As a person who buys the products. But think about it. More anti retrovirals make sense. But that's just the easy part  or ought to be. But equality for Africa    that's a big  expensive idea. You see  the scale of the suffering numbs us into a kind of indifference. What on earth can we all do about this  Well  much more than we think. We can't fix every problem  but the ones we can  I want to argue  we must. And because we can  we must. This is the straight truth  the righteous truth. It is not a theory. The fact is that ours is the first generation that can look disease and extreme poverty in the eye  look across the ocean to Africa  and say this  and mean it  we do not have to stand for this. A whole continent written off    we do not have to stand for this. And let me say this without a trace of irony    before I back it up to a bunch of ex hippies. Forget the '  s. We can change the world. I can't  you can't  as individuals  but we can change the world. I really believe that  the people in this room. Look at the Gates Foundation. They've done incredible stuff  unbelievable stuff. But working together  we can actually change the world. We can turn the inevitable outcomes  and transform the quality of life for millions of lives who look and feel rather like us  when you're up close. I'm sorry to laugh here  but you do look so different than you did in Haight Ashbury in the '  s. But I want to argue that this is the moment that you are designed for. It is the flowering of the seeds you planted in earlier  headier days. Ideas that you gestated in your youth. This is what excites me. This room was born for this moment  is really what I want to say to you tonight. Most of you started out wanting to change the world  didn't you  Most of you did  the digital world. Well  now  actually because of you  it is possible to change the physical world. It's a fact. Economists confirm it  and they know much more than I do. So why  then  are we not pumping our fists into the air  Probably because when we admit we can do something about it  we've got to do something about it. It is a pain in the arse. This equality business is actually a pain in the arse. But for the first time in history  we have the technology  we have the know how  we have the cash  we have the life saving drugs. Do we have the will  I hope this is obvious  but I'm not a hippie. And I'm not really one for the warm  fuzzy feeling. I do not have flowers in my hair. Actually  I come from punk rock. The Clash wore big army boots  not sandals. But I know toughness when I see it. And for all the talk of peace and love on the West Coast  there was muscle to the movement that started out here. You see  idealism detached from action is just a dream. But idealism allied with pragmatism  with rolling up your sleeves and making the world bend a bit  is very exciting. It's very real. It's very strong. And it's very present in a crowd like you. Last year at DATA  this organization I helped set up  we launched a campaign to summon this spirit in the fight against AIDS and extreme poverty. We're calling it the ONE Campaign. It's based on our belief that the action of one person can change a lot  but the actions of many coming together as one can change the world. Well  we feel that now is the time to prove we're right. There are moments in history when civilization redefines itself. We believe this is one. We believe that this could be the time when the world finally decides that the wanton loss of life in Africa is just no longer acceptable. This could be the time that we finally get serious about changing the future for most people who live on planet Earth. Momentum has been building. Lurching a little  but it's building. This year is a test for us all  especially the leaders of the G  nations  who really are on the line here  with all the world in history watching. I have been  of late  disappointed with the Bush Administration. They started out with such promise on Africa. They made some really great promises  and actually have fulfilled a lot of them. But some of them they haven't. They don't feel the push from the ground  is the truth. But my disappointment has much more perspective when I talk to American people  and I hear their worries about the deficit  and the fiscal well being of their country. I understand that. But there's much more push from the ground than you'd think  if we got organized. What I try to communicate  and you can help me if you agree  is that aid for Africa is just great value for money at a time when America really needs it. Putting it in the crassest possible terms  the investment reaps huge returns. Not only in lives saved  but in goodwill  stability and security that we'll gain. So this is what I hope that you will do  if I could be so bold  and not have it deducted from my number of wishes. What I hope is that beyond individual merciful acts  that you will tell the politicians to do right by Africa  by America and by the world. Give them permission  if you like  to spend their political capital and your financial capital  your national purse on saving the lives of millions of people. That's really what I would like you to do. Because we also need your intellectual capital  your ideas  your skills  your ingenuity. And you  at this conference  are in a unique position. Some of the technologies we've been talking about  you invented them  or at least revolutionized the way that they're used. Together you have changed the zeitgeist from analog to digital  and pushed the boundaries. And we'd like you to give us that energy. Give us that kind of dreaming  that kind of doing. As I say  there're two things on the line here. There's the continent Africa. But there's also our sense of ourselves. People are starting to figure this out. Movements are springing up. Artists  politicians  pop stars  priests  CEOs  NGOs  mothers' unions  student unions. A lot of people are getting together  and working under this umbrella I told you about earlier  the ONE Campaign. I think they just have one idea in their mind  which is  where you live in the world should not determine whether you live in the world. History  like God  is watching what we do. When the history books get written  I think our age will be remembered for three things. Really  it's just three things this whole age will be remembered for. The digital revolution  yes. The war against terror  yes. And what we did or did not do to put out the fires in Africa. Some say we can't afford to. I say we can't afford not to. Thank you  thank you very much. Okay  my three wishes. The ones that TED has offered to grant. You see  if this is true  and I believe it is  that the digital world you all created has uncoupled the creative imagination from the physical constraints of matter  this should be a piece of piss. I should add that this started out as a much longer list of wishes. Most of them impossible  some of them impractical and one or two of them certainly immoral. This business  it gets to be addictive  you know what I mean  when somebody else is picking up the tab. Anyway  here's number one. I wish for you to help build a social movement of more than one million American activists for Africa. That is my first wish. I believe it's possible. A few minutes ago  I talked about all the citizens' campaigns that are springing up. You know  there's lots out there. And with this one campaign as our umbrella  my organization  DATA  and other groups  have been tapping into the energy and the enthusiasm that's out there from Hollywood into the heartland of America. We know there's more than enough energy to power this movement. We just need your help in making it happen. We want all of you here  church America  corporate America  Microsoft America  Apple America  Coke America  Pepsi America  nerd America  noisy America. We can't afford to be cool and sit this one out. I do believe if we build a movement that's one million Americans strong  we're not going to be denied. We will have the ear of Congress. We'll be the first page in Condi Rice's briefing book  and right into the Oval Office. If there's one million Americans    and I really know this    who are ready to make phone calls  who are ready to be on email  I am absolutely sure that we can actually change the course of history  literally  for the continent of Africa. Anyway  so I'd like your help in getting that signed up. I know John Gage and Sun Microsystems are already on board for this  but there's lots of you we'd like to talk to. Right  my second wish  number two. I would like one media hit for every person on the planet who is living on less than one dollar a day. That's one billion media hits. Could be on Google  could be on AOL. Steve Case  Larry  Sergey    they've done a lot already. It could be NBC. It could be ABC. Actually we're talking to ABC today about the Oscars. We have a film  produced by Jon Kamen at Radical Media. But you know  we want  we need some airtime for our ideas. We need to get the math  we need to get the statistics out to the American people. I really believe that old Truman line  that if you give the American people the facts  they'll do the right thing. And  the other thing that's important is that this is not Sally Struthers. This has to be described as an adventure  not a burden. a nurse  a teacher  a homemaker  and lives are saved. The problem is enormous. Every three seconds one person dies. Another three seconds  one more. The situation is so desperate in parts of Africa  Asia  even America  that aid groups  just as they did for the tsunami  are uniting as one  acting as one. We can beat extreme poverty  starvation  AIDS. But we need your help. One more person  letter  voice will mean the difference between life and death for millions of people. Please join us by working together. Americans have an unprecedented opportunity. We can make history. We can start to make poverty history. One  by one  by one. Please visit ONE at this address. We're not asking for your money. We're asking for your voice. Bono  All right. I wish for TED to truly show the power of information  its power to rewrite the rules and transform lives  by connecting every hospital  health clinic and school in one African country. And I would like it to be Ethiopia. I believe we can connect every school in Ethiopia  every health clinic  every hospital    we can connect to the Internet. That is my wish  my third wish. I think it's possible. I think we have the money and brains in the room to do that. And that would be a mind blowing wish to come true. I've been to Ethiopia  as I said earlier. It's actually where it all started for me. The idea that the Internet  which changed all of our lives  can transform a country    and a continent that has hardly made it to analog  let alone digital    blows my mind. But it didn't start out that way. The first long distance line from Boston to New York was used in      on the phone. It was just nine years later that Addis Ababa was connected by phone to Harare  which is     kilometers away. Since then  not that much has changed. The average waiting time to get a landline in Ethiopia is actually about seven or eight years. But wireless technology wasn't dreamt up then. Anyway  I'm Irish  and as you can see  I know how important talking is. Communication is very important for Ethiopia    will transform the country. Nurses getting better training  pharmacists being able to order supplies  doctors sharing their expertise in all aspects of medicine. It's a very  very good idea to get them wired. And that is my third and final wish for you at the TED conference. Thank you very much once again.
