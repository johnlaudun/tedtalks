Seven years ago  a student came to me and asked me to invest in his company. He said   I'm working with three friends  and we're going to try to disrupt an industry by selling stuff online.  And I said   OK  you guys spent the whole summer on this  right    No  we all took internships just in case it doesn't work out.   All right  but you're going to go in full time once you graduate.   Not exactly. We've all lined up backup jobs.  Six months go by  it's the day before the company launches  and there is still not a functioning website.  You guys realize  the entire company is a website. That's literally all it is.  So I obviously declined to invest. And they ended up naming the company Warby Parker. They sell glasses online. They were recently recognized as the world's most innovative company and valued at over a billion dollars. And now  My wife handles our investments. Why was I so wrong  To find out  I've been studying people that I come to call  originals.  Originals are nonconformists  people who not only have new ideas but take action to champion them. They are people who stand out and speak up. Originals drive creativity and change in the world. They're the people you want to bet on. And they look nothing like I expected. I want to show you today three things I've learned about recognizing originals and becoming a little bit more like them. So the first reason that I passed on Warby Parker was they were really slow getting off the ground. Now  you are all intimately familiar with the mind of a procrastinator. Well  I have a confession for you. I'm the opposite. I'm a precrastinator. Yes  that's an actual term. You know that panic you feel a few hours before a big deadline when you haven't done anything yet. I just feel that a few months ahead of time. So this started early  when I was a kid  I took Nintendo games very seriously. I would wake up at  am  start playing and not stop until I had mastered them. Eventually it got so out of hand that a local newspaper came and did a story on the dark side of Nintendo  starring me. Since then  I have traded hair for teeth. But this served me well in college  because I finished my senior thesis four months before the deadline. And I was proud of that  until a few years ago. I had a student named Jihae  who came to me and said   I have my most creative ideas when I'm procrastinating.  And I was like   That's cute  where are the four papers you owe me   No  she was one of our most creative students  and as an organizational psychologist  this is the kind of idea that I test. So I challenged her to get some data. She goes into a bunch of companies. She has people fill out surveys about how often they procrastinate. Then she gets their bosses to rate how creative and innovative they are. And sure enough  the precrastinators like me  who rush in and do everything early are rated as less creative than people who procrastinate moderately. So I want to know what happens to the chronic procrastinators. She was like   I don't know. They didn't fill out my survey.  No  here are our results. You actually do see that the people who wait until the last minute are so busy goofing off that they don't have any new ideas. And on the flip side  the people who race in are in such a frenzy of anxiety that they don't have original thoughts either. There's a sweet spot where originals seem to live. Why is this  Maybe original people just have bad work habits. Maybe procrastinating does not cause creativity. To find out  we designed some experiments. We asked people to generate new business ideas  and then we get independent readers to evaluate how creative and useful they are. And some of them are asked to do the task right away. Others we randomly assign to procrastinate by dangling Minesweeper in front of them for either five or    minutes. And sure enough  the moderate procrastinators are    percent more creative than the other two groups. Now  Minesweeper is awesome  but it's not the driver of the effect  because if you play the game first before you learn about the task  there's no creativity boost. It's only when you're told that you're going to be working on this problem  and then you start procrastinating  but the task is still active in the back of your mind  that you start to incubate. Procrastination gives you time to consider divergent ideas  to think in nonlinear ways  to make unexpected leaps. So just as we were finishing these experiments  I was starting to write a book about originals  and I thought   This is the perfect time to teach myself to procrastinate  while writing a chapter on procrastination.  So I metaprocrastinated  and like any self respecting precrastinator  I woke up early the next morning and I made a to do list with steps on how to procrastinate. And then I worked diligently toward my goal of not making progress toward my goal. I started writing the procrastination chapter  and one day    I was halfway through    I literally put it away in mid sentence for months. It was agony. But when I came back to it  I had all sorts of new ideas. As Aaron Sorkin put it   You call it procrastinating. I call it thinking.  And along the way I discovered that a lot of great originals in history were procrastinators. Take Leonardo da Vinci. He toiled on and off for    years on the Mona Lisa. He felt like a failure. He wrote as much in his journal. But some of the diversions he took in optics transformed the way that he modeled light and made him into a much better painter. What about Martin Luther King  Jr.  The night before the biggest speech of his life  the March on Washington  he was up past  am  rewriting it. He's sitting in the audience waiting for his turn to go onstage  and he is still scribbling notes and crossing out lines. When he gets onstage     minutes in  he leaves his prepared remarks to utter four words that changed the course of history   I have a dream.  That was not in the script. By delaying the task of finalizing the speech until the very last minute  he left himself open to the widest range of possible ideas. And because the text wasn't set in stone  he had freedom to improvise. Procrastinating is a vice when it comes to productivity  but it can be a virtue for creativity. What you see with a lot of great originals is that they are quick to start but they're slow to finish. And this is what I missed with Warby Parker. When they were dragging their heels for six months  I looked at them and said   You know  a lot of other companies are starting to sell glasses online.  They missed the first mover advantage. But what I didn't realize was they were spending all that time trying to figure out how to get people to be comfortable ordering glasses online. And it turns out the first mover advantage is mostly a myth. Look at a classic study of over    product categories  comparing the first movers who created the market with the improvers who introduced something different and better. What you see is that the first movers had a failure rate of    percent  compared with only   percent for the improvers. Look at Facebook  waiting to build a social network until after Myspace and Friendster. Look at Google  waiting for years after Altavista and Yahoo. It's much easier to improve on somebody else's idea than it is to create something new from scratch. So the lesson I learned is that to be original you don't have to be first. You just have to be different and better. But that wasn't the only reason I passed on Warby Parker. They were also full of doubts. They had backup plans lined up  and that made me doubt that they had the courage to be original  because I expected that originals would look something like this. Now  on the surface  a lot of original people look confident  but behind the scenes  they feel the same fear and doubt that the rest of us do. They just manage it differently. Let me show you  this is a depiction of how the creative process works for most of us. Now  in my research  I discovered there are two different kinds of doubt. There's self doubt and idea doubt. Self doubt is paralyzing. It leads you to freeze. But idea doubt is energizing. It motivates you to test  to experiment  to refine  just like MLK did. And so the key to being original is just a simple thing of avoiding the leap from step three to step four. Instead of saying   I'm crap   you say   The first few drafts are always crap  and I'm just not there yet.  So how do you get there  Well  there's a clue  it turns out  in the Internet browser that you use. We can predict your job performance and your commitment just by knowing what web browser you use. Now  some of you are not going to like the results of this study    But there is good evidence that Firefox and Chrome users significantly outperform Internet Explorer and Safari users. Yes. They also stay in their jobs    percent longer  by the way. Why  It's not a technical advantage. The four browser groups on average have similar typing speed and they also have similar levels of computer knowledge. It's about how you got the browser. Because if you use Internet Explorer or Safari  those came preinstalled on your computer  and you accepted the default option that was handed to you. If you wanted Firefox or Chrome  you had to doubt the default and ask  is there a different option out there  and then be a little resourceful and download a new browser. So people hear about this study and they're like   Great  if I want to get better at my job  I just need to upgrade my browser   No  it's about being the kind of person who takes the initiative to doubt the default and look for a better option. And if you do that well  you will open yourself up to the opposite of d j  vu. There's a name for it. It's called vuja de. Vuja de is when you look at something you've seen many times before and all of a sudden see it with fresh eyes. It's a screenwriter who looks at a movie script that can't get the green light for more than half a century. In every past version  the main character has been an evil queen. But Jennifer Lee starts to question whether that makes sense. She rewrites the first act  reinvents the villain as a tortured hero and Frozen becomes the most successful animated movie ever. So there's a simple message from this story. When you feel doubt  don't let it go. What about fear  Originals feel fear  too. They're afraid of failing  but what sets them apart from the rest of us is that they're even more afraid of failing to try. They know you can fail by starting a business that goes bankrupt or by failing to start a business at all. They know that in the long run  our biggest regrets are not our actions but our inactions. The things we wish we could redo  if you look at the science  are the chances not taken. Elon Musk told me recently  he didn't expect Tesla to succeed. He was sure the first few SpaceX launches would fail to make it to orbit  let alone get back  but it was too important not to try. And for so many of us  when we have an important idea  we don't bother to try. But I have some good news for you. You are not going to get judged on your bad ideas. A lot of people think they will. If you look across industries and ask people about their biggest idea  their most important suggestion     percent of them stayed silent instead of speaking up. They were afraid of embarrassing themselves  of looking stupid. But guess what  Originals have lots and lots of bad ideas  tons of them  in fact. Take the guy who invented this. Do you care that he came up with a talking doll so creepy that it scared not only kids but adults  too  No. You celebrate Thomas Edison for pioneering the light bulb. If you look across fields  the greatest originals are the ones who fail the most  because they're the ones who try the most. Take classical composers  the best of the best. Why do some of them get more pages in encyclopedias than others and also have their compositions rerecorded more times  One of the best predictors is the sheer volume of compositions that they generate. The more output you churn out  the more variety you get and the better your chances of stumbling on something truly original. Even the three icons of classical music    Bach  Beethoven  Mozart    had to generate hundreds and hundreds of compositions to come up with a much smaller number of masterpieces. Now  you may be wondering  how did this guy become great without doing a whole lot  I don't know how Wagner pulled that off. But for most of us  if we want to be more original  we have to generate more ideas. The Warby Parker founders  when they were trying to name their company  they needed something sophisticated  unique  with no negative associations to build a retail brand  and they tested over       possibilities before they finally put together Warby and Parker. So if you put all this together  what you see is that originals are not that different from the rest of us. They feel fear and doubt. They procrastinate. They have bad ideas. And sometimes  it's not in spite of those qualities but because of them that they succeed. So when you see those things  don't make the same mistake I did. Don't write them off. And when that's you  don't count yourself out either. Know that being quick to start but slow to finish can boost your creativity  that you can motivate yourself by doubting your ideas and embracing the fear of failing to try  and that you need a lot of bad ideas in order to get a few good ones. Look  being original is not easy  but I have no doubt about this  it's the best way to improve the world around us. Thank you. I'm here to talk to you today about a story that we have all been conditioned to believe is not possible. It's a story about a living  breathing start up flourishing in an unlikely environment  the United States government. Now  this start up is fundamentally beginning to disrupt the way government does business from the inside out. But before I get there  let's start with the problem. For me  the problem begins with a number     .     is the average number of days a veteran has to wait to have benefits processed by the VA.     days. Now  in order to file that application in the first place  she has to navigate over       different websites and over     different call in numbers  all owned and operated by the United States government. Now  we live in times of incredible change. The private sector is constantly changing and improving itself all the time. For that matter  it's removing every single inconvenience in my life that I could possibly think of. I could be sitting on my couch in my apartment  and from my phone  I can order a warm  gluten free meal that can arrive at my door in less than    minutes. But meanwhile  a working mother who depends on food stamps to support her family has to complete an arduous  complicated application which she might not even be able to do online. And the inability of her to do that same work from her couch means that she might be having to take days or hours off of work that she can't spare. And this growing dichotomy between the beneficiaries of the tech revolution and those it's left behind is one of the greatest challenges of our time    Because government's failure to deliver digital services that work is disproportionately impacting the very people who need it most. It's impacting the students trying to go to college  the single mothers trying to get health care  the veterans coming home from battle. They can't get what they need when they need it. And for these Americans  government is more than just a presidential election every four years. Government is a lifeline that provides services they need and depend on and deserve. Which is  quite frankly  why government needs to get its shit together and catch up. Just saying. Now  this wasn't always a problem I was passionate about. When I joined President Obama's campaign in       we brought the tech industry's best practices into politics. We earned more money  we engaged more volunteers and we earned more votes than any political campaign in history. We were a cutting edge start up that changed the game of politics forever. So when the President asked a small group of us to bring that very same disruption directly into government  I knew it wasn't going to be easy work  but I was eager and showed up ready to get to work. Now  on my first day in DC  my first day in government  I walked into the office and they handed me a laptop. And the laptop was running Windows   . I mean  three entire presidential elections had come and gone since the government had updated the operating system on that computer. Three elections  Which is when we realized this problem was a whole lot bigger than we ever could have imagined. Let me paint the picture for you. The federal government is the largest institution in the world. It spends over    billion dollars a year       billion    on federal IT projects. For context  that is more than the entire venture capital industry spends annually    on everything. Now  the problem here is that we the taxpayers are not getting what we pay for  because    percent of federal IT projects are over budget or behind schedule.    percent  For those of you keeping score  yes  the number    is very close to    . There's another problem     percent of those never end up seeing the light of day. They are completely scrapped or abandoned. Now  this is a very existentially painful moment for any organization  because it means as government continues to operate as it's programmed to do  failure is nearly inevitable. And when the status quo is the riskiest option  that means there is simply no other choice than radical disruption. So  what do we do about it  How do we fix this  Well  the irony of all of this is that we actually don't have to look any further than our backyard  because right here in America are the very ideas  the very people  who have swept our world into a radically different place than it was two decades ago. So what would it look like if it was actually as easy to get student loans or veterans' benefits as it is to order cat food to my house  What would it look like if there was an easy pathway for the very entrepreneurs and innovators who have disrupted our tech sector to come and disrupt their government  Well  my friends  here's where we get to talk about some of the exciting new formulas we've discovered for creating change in government. Enter the United States Digital Service. The United States Digital Service is a new network of start ups  a team of teams  organizing themselves across government to create radical change. The mission of the United States Digital Service is to help government deliver world class digital services for students  immigrants  children  the elderly    everybody    at dramatically lower costs. We are essentially trying to build a more awesome government  for the people  by the people  today. We don't care     Applause  Thank you. Who doesn't want a more awesome government  right  We don't care about politics. We care about making government work better  because it's the only one we've got. Now  you can think of our team    well  it's pretty funny    you can think of our team a little bit like the Peace Corps meets DARPA meets SEAL Team  . We're like the Peace Corps for nerds  but instead of traveling to crazy  interesting  far off places  you spend a lot of time indoors  behind computers  helping restore the fabric of our democracy. Now  this team    our playbook for the United States Digital Service is pretty simple. The first play is we recruit the very best talent our country has to offer  and recruit them for short tours of duty inside government. These are the very people who have helped build the products and companies that have made our tech sector amongst the most innovative in the world. Second  we pair these incredible people from the tech core with the dedicated civil servants already inside government on the ground creating change. Third  we strategically deploy them in a targeted formation at the most mission critical  life changing  important services that government offers. And finally  we give them massive air cover  from the leadership inside the agencies all the way up to the President himself  to transform these services for the better. Now  this team is beginning to disrupt how government does business from the inside out. If you study classic patterns of disruption  one very common pattern is rather simple. It's to take something that has become routine and standard in one industry and apply it to another where it's a radical departure from the status quo. Think about what Airbnb took that was normal from hospitality and revolutionized my apartment. The United States Digital Service is doing exactly that. We are taking what Silicon Valley and the private sector has learned through a ton of hard work about how to build planetary scale digital services that delight users at lower cost  and we're applying that to government  where it is a radical departure from the status quo. Now  the good news is  it's starting to work. We know this because we can already see the results from some of our early projects  like the rescue effort of Healthcare.gov  when that went off the rails. Fixing Healthcare.gov was the first place that we ran this play  and today we are taking that same play and scaling it across a large number of government's most important citizen facing services. Now  if I can take a moment and brag about the team for a second    it is the highest concentration of badasses I could have ever dreamed of. We have top talent from Google  Facebook  Amazon  Twitter and the likes  all on staff today  all choosing to join their government. And what's incredible is  everybody is as eager and kind as they are intelligent. And I might add  by the way  over half of us are women. The best way to understand this strategy is actually to walk through a couple of examples of how it's working out in the wild. I'm going to give you two examples quickly. The first one is about immigration. This  my friends  is your typical immigration application. Yes  you guessed it    it's almost entirely paper based. In the best case  the application takes about six to eight months to process. It is physically shipped thousands of miles    thousands of miles     between no less than six processing centers. Now  little story  about a decade ago  the government thought that if it brought this system online  it could save taxpayer dollars and provide a better service  which was a great idea. So  the typical government process began. Six years and  .  billion dollars later  no working product was delivered     .  billion with a  B.  Now at this point  the agency responsible  US Citizenship and Immigration Services  could have kept pouring money into the failing program. Sadly  that's what often happens. That's the status quo today. But they didn't. The dedicated civil servants inside the agency decided to stand up and call for change. We deployed a small team of just six people  and what many people don't know is that's the same size as the rescue effort of Healthcare.gov    just six people. And that team jumped in  side by side  to support the agency in transitioning this project into more modern business practices  more modern development practices. Now  in non tech speak  what that basically means is taking big  multi year projects and breaking them up into bite sized chunks  so that way we can reduce the risk and actually start to see results every couple of weeks  instead of waiting in a black box for years. So within less than three months of our team being on the ground  we were already able to push our first products to production. The first one  this is the form I   . This is used to file for your replacement green card. Now  for immigrant visa holders  a replacement green card is a big deal. Your green card is your proof of identification  it's your work authorization  it's the proof that you can be here in this country. So waiting six months while the government processes the replacement is not cool. I'm excited to tell you that today  you can now  for the first time  file for a replacement green card entirely online without anyone touching a piece of paper. It is faster  it is cheaper  and it's a better user experience for the applicant and the government employees alike. Another one  quickly. Last fall  we just released a brand new practice civics test. So as part of becoming a US citizen  you have to pass a civics test. For anyone who has taken this test  it can be quite the stressful process. So our team released a very easy  simple to use tool in plain language to help people prepare  to help ease their nerves  to help them feel more confident in taking the next step in pursuing their American dream. Because all of this work  all of this work on immigration  is about taking complicated processes and making them more human. The other day  one of the dedicated civil servants on the ground said something incredibly profound. She said that she's never been this hopeful or optimistic about a project in her entire time in government. And she's been doing this for    years. That is exactly the kind of hope and culture change we are trying to create. For my second example  I want to bring it back to veterans for a second  and what we are doing to build them a VA that is worthy of their service and their sacrifice. I'm proud to say that just a few months ago  we released a brand new beta of a new website  Vets.gov. Vets.gov is a simple  easy to use website that brings all of the online services a veteran needs into one place. One website  not thousands. The site is a work in progress  but it's significant progress  because it's designed with the users who matter most  the veterans themselves. This might sound incredibly obvious  because it should be  but sadly  this isn't normal for government. Far too often  product decisions are made by committees of stakeholders who do their best to represent the interests of the user  but they're not necessarily the users themselves. So our team at the VA went out  we looked at the data  we talked to veterans themselves and we started simple and small  with the two most important services that matter most to them  education benefits and disability benefits. I'm proud to say that they are live on the site today  and as the team continues to streamline more services  they will be ported over here  and the old sites  shut down. To me  this is what change looks like in     . When you walk out of the Oval Office  the first time I was ever there  I noticed a quote the President had embroidered on the rug. It's the classic JFK quote. It says   No problem of human destiny is beyond human beings.  It's true. We have the tools to solve these problems. We have the tools to come together as a society  as a country  and to fix this together. Yes  it's hard. It's particularly hard when we have to fight  when we have to refuse to succumb to the belief that things won't change. But in my experience  it's often the hardest things that are the most worth doing  because if we don't do them  who will  This is on us  all of us  together  because government is not an abstract institution or a concept. Our government is us. Today  it is no longer a question of if change is possible. The question is not   Can we   The question is   Will we   Will you  Thank you. Thank you. I want you to reimagine how life is organized on earth. Think of the planet like a human body that we inhabit. The skeleton is the transportation system of roads and railways  bridges and tunnels  air and seaports that enable our mobility across the continents. The vascular system that powers the body are the oil and gas pipelines and electricity grids. that distribute energy. And the nervous system of communications is the Internet cables  satellites  cellular networks and data centers that allow us to share information. This ever expanding infrastructural matrix already consists of    million kilometers of roads  four million kilometers of railways  two million kilometers of pipelines and one million kilometers of Internet cables. What about international borders  We have less than         kilometers of borders. Let's build a better map of the world. And we can start by overcoming some ancient mythology. There's a saying with which all students of history are familiar   Geography is destiny.  Sounds so grave  doesn't it  It's such a fatalistic adage. It tells us that landlocked countries are condemned to be poor  that small countries cannot escape their larger neighbors  that vast distances are insurmountable. But every journey I take around the world  I see an even greater force sweeping the planet  connectivity. The global connectivity revolution  in all of its forms    transportation  energy and communications    has enabled such a quantum leap in the mobility of people  of goods  of resources  of knowledge  such that we can no longer even think of geography as distinct from it. In fact  I view the two forces as fusing together into what I call  connectography.  Connectography represents a quantum leap in the mobility of people  resources and ideas  but it is an evolution  an evolution of the world from political geography  which is how we legally divide the world  to functional geography  which is how we actually use the world  from nations and borders  to infrastructure and supply chains. Our global system is evolving from the vertically integrated empires of the   th century  through the horizontally interdependent nations of the   th century  into a global network civilization in the   st century. Connectivity  not sovereignty  has become the organizing principle of the human species. We are becoming this global network civilization because we are literally building it. All of the world's defense budgets and military spending taken together total just under two trillion dollars per year. Meanwhile  our global infrastructure spending is projected to rise to nine trillion dollars per year within the coming decade. And  well  it should. We have been living off an infrastructure stock meant for a world population of three billion  as our population has crossed seven billion to eight billion and eventually nine billion and more. As a rule of thumb  we should spend about one trillion dollars on the basic infrastructure needs of every billion people in the world. Not surprisingly  Asia is in the lead. In       China announced the creation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank  which together with a network of other organizations aims to construct a network of iron and silk roads  stretching from Shanghai to Lisbon. And as all of this topographical engineering unfolds  we will likely spend more on infrastructure in the next    years  we will build more infrastructure in the next    years  than we have in the past       years. Now let's stop and think about it for a minute. Spending so much more on building the foundations of global society rather than on the tools to destroy it can have profound consequences. Connectivity is how we optimize the distribution of people and resources around the world. It is how mankind comes to be more than just the sum of its parts. I believe that is what is happening. Connectivity has a twin megatrend in the   st century  planetary urbanization. Cities are the infrastructures that most define us. By       more than two thirds of the world's population will live in cities. And these are not mere little dots on the map  but they are vast archipelagos stretching hundreds of kilometers. Here we are in Vancouver  at the head of the Cascadia Corridor that stretches south across the US border to Seattle. The technology powerhouse of Silicon Valley begins north of San Francisco down to San Jose and across the bay to Oakland. The sprawl of Los Angeles now passes San Diego across the Mexican border to Tijuana. San Diego and Tijuana now share an airport terminal where you can exit into either country. Eventually  a high speed rail network may connect the entire Pacific spine. America's northeastern megalopolis begins in Boston through New York and Philadelphia to Washington. It contains more than    million people and also has plans for a high speed rail network. But Asia is where we really see the megacities coming together. This continuous strip of light from Tokyo through Nagoya to Osaka contains more than    million people and most of Japan's economy. It is the world's largest megacity. For now. But in China  megacity clusters are coming together with populations reaching     million people. The Bohai Rim around Beijing  The Yangtze River Delta around Shanghai and the Pearl River Delta  stretching from Hong Kong north to Guangzhou. And in the middle  the Chongqing Chengdu megacity cluster  whose geographic footprint is almost the same size as the country of Austria. And any number of these megacity clusters has a GDP approaching two trillion dollars    that's almost the same as all of India today. So imagine if our global diplomatic institutions  such as the G    were to base their membership on economic size rather than national representation. Some Chinese megacities may be in and have a seat at the table  while entire countries  like Argentina or Indonesia would be out. Moving to India  whose population will soon exceed that of China  it too has a number of megacity clusters  such as the Delhi Capital Region and Mumbai. In the Middle East  Greater Tehran is absorbing one third of Iran's population. Most of Egypt's    million people live in the corridor between Cairo and Alexandria. And in the gulf  a necklace of city states is forming  from Bahrain and Qatar  through the United Arab Emirates to Muscat in Oman. And then there's Lagos  Africa's largest city and Nigeria's commercial hub. It has plans for a rail network that will make it the anchor of a vast Atlantic coastal corridor  stretching across Benin  Togo and Ghana  to Abidjan  the capital of the Ivory Coast. But these countries are suburbs of Lagos. In a megacity world  countries can be suburbs of cities. By       we will have as many as    such megacity clusters in the world. So which map tells you more  Our traditional map of     discrete nations that hang on most of our walls  or this map of the    megacity clusters  And yet  even this is incomplete because you cannot understand any individual megacity without understanding its connections to the others. People move to cities to be connected  and connectivity is why these cities thrive. Any number of them  such as Sao Paulo or Istanbul or Moscow  has a GDP approaching or exceeding one third of one half of their entire national GDP. But equally importantly  you cannot calculate any of their individual value without understanding the role of the flows of people  of finance  of technology that enable them to thrive. Take the Gauteng province of South Africa  which contains Johannesburg and the capital Pretoria. It too represents just over a third of South Africa's GDP. But equally importantly  it is home to the offices of almost every single multinational corporation that invests directly into South Africa and indeed  into the entire African continent. Cities want to be part of global value chains. They want to be part of this global division of labor. That is how cities think. I've never met a mayor who said to me   I want my city to be cut off.  They know that their cities belong as much to the global network civilization as to their home countries. Now  for many people  urbanization causes great dismay. They think cities are wrecking the planet. But right now  there are more than     intercity learning networks thriving. That is as many as the number of intergovernmental organizations that we have. And all of these intercity networks are devoted to one purpose  mankind's number one priority in the   st century  sustainable urbanization. Is it working  Let's take climate change. We know that summit after summit in New York and Paris is not going to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But what we can see is that transferring technology and knowledge and policies between cities is how we've actually begun to reduce the carbon intensity of our economies. Cities are learning from each other. How to install zero emissions buildings  how to deploy electric car sharing systems. In major Chinese cities  they're imposing quotas on the number of cars on the streets. In many Western cities  young people don't even want to drive anymore. Cities have been part of the problem  now they are part of the solution. Inequality is the other great challenge to achieving sustainable urbanization. When I travel through megacities from end to end    it takes hours and days    I experience the tragedy of extreme disparity within the same geography. And yet  our global stock of financial assets has never been larger  approaching     trillion dollars. That's almost four times the actual GDP of the world. We have taken on such enormous debts since the financial crisis  but have we invested them in inclusive growth  No  not yet. Only when we build sufficient  affordable public housing  when we invest in robust transportation networks to allow people to connect to each other both physically and digitally  that's when our divided cities and societies will come to feel whole again. And that is why infrastructure has just been included in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals  because it enables all the others. Our political and economic leaders are learning that connectivity is not charity  it's opportunity. And that's why our financial community needs to understand that connectivity is the most important asset class of the   st century. Now  cities can make the world more sustainable  they can make the world more equitable  I also believe that connectivity between cities can make the world more peaceful. If we look at regions of the world with dense relations across borders  we see more trade  more investment and more stability. We all know the story of Europe after World War II  where industrial integration kicked off a process that gave rise to today's peaceful European Union. And you can see that Russia  by the way  is the least connected of major powers in the international system. And that goes a long way towards explaining the tensions today. Countries that have less stake in the system also have less to lose in disturbing it. In North America  the lines that matter most on the map are not the US Canada border or the US Mexico border  but the dense network of roads and railways and pipelines and electricity grids and even water canals that are forming an integrated North American union. North America does not need more walls  it needs more connections. But the real promise of connectivity is in the postcolonial world. All of those regions where borders have historically been the most arbitrary and where generations of leaders have had hostile relations with each other. But now a new group of leaders has come into power and is burying the hatchet. Let's take Southeast Asia  where high speed rail networks are planned to connect Bangkok to Singapore and trade corridors from Vietnam to Myanmar. Now this region of     million people coordinates its agricultural resources and its industrial output. It is evolving into what I call a Pax Asiana  a peace among Southeast Asian nations. A similar phenomenon is underway in East Africa  where a half dozen countries are investing in railways and multimodal corridors so that landlocked countries can get their goods to market. Now these countries coordinate their utilities and their investment policies. They  too  are evolving into a Pax Africana. One region we know could especially use this kind of thinking is the Middle East. As Arab states tragically collapse  what is left behind but the ancient cities  such as Cairo  Beirut and Baghdad  In fact  the nearly     million people of the Arab world are almost entirely urbanized. As societies  as cities  they are either water rich or water poor  energy rich or energy poor. And the only way to correct these mismatches is not through more wars and more borders  but through more connectivity of pipelines and water canals. Sadly  this is not yet the map of the Middle East. But it should be  a connected Pax Arabia  internally integrated and productively connected to its neighbors  Europe  Asia and Africa. Now  it may not seem like connectivity is what we want right now towards the world's most turbulent region. But we know from history that more connectivity is the only way to bring about stability in the long run. Because we know that in region after region  connectivity is the new reality. Cities and countries are learning to aggregate into more peaceful and prosperous wholes. But the real test is going to be Asia. Can connectivity overcome the patterns of rivalry among the great powers of the Far East  After all  this is where World War III is supposed to break out. Since the end of the Cold War  a quarter century ago  at least six major wars have been predicted for this region. But none have broken out. Take China and Taiwan. In the     s  this was everyone's leading World War III scenario. But since that time  the trade and investment volumes across the straits have become so intense that last November  leaders from both sides held a historic summit to discuss eventual peaceful reunification. And even the election of a nationalist party in Taiwan that's pro independence earlier this year does not undermine this fundamental dynamic. China and Japan have an even longer history of rivalry and have been deploying their air forces and navies to show their strength in island disputes. But in recent years  Japan has been making its largest foreign investments in China. Japanese cars are selling in record numbers there. And guess where the largest number of foreigners residing in Japan today comes from  You guessed it  China. China and India have fought a major war and have three outstanding border disputes  but today India is the second largest shareholder in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. They're building a trade corridor stretching from Northeast India through Myanmar and Bangladesh to Southern China. Their trade volume has grown from    billion dollars a decade ago to    billion dollars today. Nuclear armed India and Pakistan have fought three wars and continue to dispute Kashmir  but they're also negotiating a most favored nation trade agreement and want to complete a pipeline stretching from Iran through Pakistan to India. And let's talk about Iran. Wasn't it just two years ago that war with Iran seemed inevitable  Then why is every single major power rushing to do business there today  Ladies and gentlemen  I cannot guarantee that World War III will not break out. But we can definitely see why it hasn't happened yet. Even though Asia is home to the world's fastest growing militaries  these same countries are also investing billions of dollars in each other's infrastructure and supply chains. They are more interested in each other's functional geography than in their political geography. And that is why their leaders think twice  step back from the brink  and decide to focus on economic ties over territorial tensions. So often it seems like the world is falling apart  but building more connectivity is how we put Humpty Dumpty back together again  much better than before. And by wrapping the world in such seamless physical and digital connectivity  we evolve towards a world in which people can rise above their geographic constraints. We are the cells and vessels pulsing through these global connectivity networks. Everyday  hundreds of millions of people go online and work with people they've never met. More than one billion people cross borders every year  and that's expected to rise to three billion in the coming decade. We don't just build connectivity  we embody it. We are the global network civilization  and this is our map. A map of the world in which geography is no longer destiny. Instead  the future has a new and more hopeful motto  connectivity is destiny. Thank you. When I was seven years old  some well meaning adult asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. Proudly  I said   An artist.   No  you don't   he said   You can't make a living being an artist   My little seven year old Picasso dreams were crushed. But I gathered myself  went off in search of a new dream  eventually settling on being a scientist  perhaps something like the next Albert Einstein. I have always loved math and science  later  coding. And so I decided to study computer programming in college. In my junior year  my computer graphics professor showed us these wonderful short films. It was the first computer animation any of us had ever seen. I watched these films in wonder  transfixed  fireworks going off in my head  thinking   That is what I want to do with my life.  The idea that all the math  science and code I had been learning could come together to create these worlds and characters and stories I connected with  was pure magic for me. Just two years later  I started working at the place that made those films  Pixar Animation Studios. It was here I learned how we actually execute those films. To create our movies  we create a three dimensional world inside the computer. We start with a point that makes a line that makes a face that creates characters  or trees and rocks that eventually become a forest. And because it's a three dimensional world  we can move a camera around inside that world. I was fascinated by all of it. But then I got my first taste of lighting. Lighting in practice is placing lights inside this three dimensional world. I actually have icons of lights I move around in there. Here you can see I've added a light  I'm turning on the rough version of lighting in our software  turn on shadows and placing the light. As I place a light  I think about what it might look like in real life  but balance that out with what we need artistically and for the story. So it might look like this at first  but as we adjust this and move that in weeks of work  in rough form it might look like this  and in final form  like this. There's this moment in lighting that made me fall utterly in love with it. It's where we go from this to this. It's the moment where all the pieces come together  and suddenly the world comes to life as if it's an actual place that exists. This moment never gets old  especially for that little seven year old girl that wanted to be an artist. As I learned to light  I learned about using light to help tell story  to set the time of day  to create the mood  to guide the audience's eye  how to make a character look appealing or stand out in a busy set. Did you see WALL E  There he is. As you can see  we can create any world that we want inside the computer. We can make a world with monsters  with robots that fall in love  we can even make pigs fly. While this is an incredible thing  this untethered artistic freedom  it can create chaos. It can create unbelievable worlds  unbelievable movement  things that are jarring to the audience. So to combat this  we tether ourselves with science. We use science and the world we know as a backbone  to ground ourselves in something relatable and recognizable.  Finding Nemo  is an excellent example of this. A major portion of the movie takes place underwater. But how do you make it look underwater  In early research and development  we took a clip of underwater footage and recreated it in the computer. Then we broke it back down to see which elements make up that underwater look. One of the most critical elements was how the light travels through the water. So we coded up a light that mimics this physics    first  the visibility of the water  and then what happens with the color. Objects close to the eye have their full  rich colors. As light travels deeper into the water  we lose the red wavelengths  then the green wavelengths  leaving us with blue at the far depths. In this clip you can see two other important elements. The first is the surge and swell  or the invisible underwater current that pushes the bits of particulate around in the water. The second is the caustics. These are the ribbons of light  like you might see on the bottom of a pool  that are created when the sun bends through the crests of the ripples and waves on the ocean's surface. Here we have the fog beams. These give us color depth cues  but also tells which direction is up in shots where we don't see the water surface. The other really cool thing you can see here is that we lit that particulate only with the caustics  so that as it goes in and out of those ribbons of light  it appears and disappears  lending a subtle  magical sparkle to the underwater. You can see how we're using the science    the physics of water  light and movement    to tether that artistic freedom. But we are not beholden to it. We considered each of these elements and which ones had to be scientifically accurate and which ones we could push and pull to suit the story and the mood. We realized early on that color was one we had some leeway with. So here's a traditionally colored underwater scene. But here  we can take Sydney Harbor and push it fairly green to suit the sad mood of what's happening. In this scene  it's really important we see deep into the underwater  so we understand what the East Australian Current is  that the turtles are diving into and going on this roller coaster ride. So we pushed the visibility of the water well past anything you would ever see in real life. Because in the end  we are not trying to recreate the scientifically correct real world  we're trying to create a believable world  one the audience can immerse themselves in to experience the story. We use science to create something wonderful. We use story and artistic touch to get us to a place of wonder. This guy  WALL E  is a great example of that. He finds beauty in the simplest things. But when he came in to lighting  we knew we had a big problem. We got so geeked out on making WALL E this convincing robot  that we made his binoculars practically optically perfect. His binoculars are one of the most critical acting devices he has. He doesn't have a face or even traditional dialogue  for that matter. So the animators were heavily dependent on the binoculars to sell his acting and emotions. We started lighting and we realized the triple lenses inside his binoculars were a mess of reflections. He was starting to look glassy eyed. Now  glassy eyed is a fundamentally awful thing when you are trying to convince an audience that a robot has a personality and he's capable of falling in love. So we went to work on these optically perfect binoculars  trying to find a solution that would maintain his true robot materials but solve this reflection problem. So we started with the lenses. Here's the flat front lens  we have a concave lens and a convex lens. And here you see all three together  showing us all these reflections. We tried turning them down  we tried blocking them  nothing was working. You can see here  sometimes we needed something specific reflected in his eyes    usually Eve. So we couldn't just use some faked abstract image on the lenses. So here we have Eve on the first lens  we put Eve on the second lens  it's not working. We turn it down  it's still not working. And then we have our eureka moment. We add a light to WALL E that accidentally leaks into his eyes. You can see it light up these gray aperture blades. Suddenly  those aperture blades are poking through that reflection the way nothing else has. Now we recognize WALL E as having an eye. As humans we have the white of our eye  the colored iris and the black pupil. Now WALL E has the black of an eye  the gray aperture blades and the black pupil. Suddenly  WALL E feels like he has a soul  like there's a character with emotion inside. Later in the movie towards the end  WALL E loses his personality  essentially going dead. This is the perfect time to bring back that glassy eyed look. In the next scene  WALL E comes back to life. We bring that light back to bring the aperture blades back  and he returns to that sweet  soulful robot we've come to love. Danielle Feinberg  There's a beauty in these unexpected moments    when you find the key to unlocking a robot's soul  the moment when you discover what you want to do with your life. The jellyfish in  Finding Nemo  was one of those moments for me. There are scenes in every movie that struggle to come together. This was one of those scenes. The director had a vision for this scene based on some wonderful footage of jellyfish in the South Pacific. As we went along  we were floundering. The reviews with the director turned from the normal look and feel conversation into more and more questions about numbers and percentages. Maybe because unlike normal  we were basing it on something in real life  or maybe just because we had lost our way. But it had become about using our brain without our eyes  the science without the art. That scientific tether was strangling the scene. But even through all the frustrations  I still believed it could be beautiful. So when it came in to lighting  I dug in. As I worked to balance the blues and the pinks  the caustics dancing on the jellyfish bells  the undulating fog beams  something promising began to appear. I came in one morning and checked the previous night's work. And I got excited. And then I showed it to the lighting director and she got excited. Soon  I was showing to the director in a dark room full of    people. In director review  you hope you might get some nice words  then you get some notes and fixes  generally. And then  hopefully  you get a final  signaling to move on to the next stage. I gave my intro  and I played the jellyfish scene. And the director was silent for an uncomfortably long amount of time. Just long enough for me to think   Oh no  this is doomed.  And then he started clapping. And then the production designer started clapping. And then the whole room was clapping. This is the moment that I live for in lighting. The moment where it all comes together and we get a world that we can believe in. We use math  science and code to create these amazing worlds. We use storytelling and art to bring them to life. It's this interweaving of art and science that elevates the world to a place of wonder  a place with soul  a place we can believe in  a place where the things you imagine can become real    and a world where a girl suddenly realizes not only is she a scientist  but also an artist. Thank you. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence  and it is my job  my responsibility  as an astronomer to remind people that alien hypotheses should always be a last resort. Now  I want to tell you a story about that. It involves data from a NASA mission  ordinary people and one of the most extraordinary stars in our galaxy. It began in      with the launch of NASA's Kepler mission. Kepler's main scientific objective was to find planets outside of our solar system. It did this by staring at a single field in the sky  this one  with all the tiny boxes. And in this one field  it monitored the brightness of over         stars continuously for four years  taking a data point every    minutes. It was looking for what astronomers call a transit. This is when the planet's orbit is aligned in our line of sight  just so that the planet crosses in front of a star. And when this happens  it blocks out a tiny bit of starlight  which you can see as a dip in this curve. And so the team at NASA had developed very sophisticated computers to search for transits in all the Kepler data. At the same time of the first data release  astronomers at Yale were wondering an interesting thing  What if computers missed something  And so we launched the citizen science project called Planet Hunters to have people look at the same data. The human brain has an amazing ability for pattern recognition  sometimes even better than a computer. However  there was a lot of skepticism around this. My colleague  Debra Fischer  founder of the Planet Hunters project  said that people at the time were saying   You're crazy. There's no way that a computer will miss a signal.  And so it was on  the classic human versus machine gamble. And if we found one planet  we would be thrilled. When I joined the team four years ago  we had already found a couple. And today  with the help of over         science enthusiasts  we have found dozens  and we've also found one of the most mysterious stars in our galaxy. So to understand this  let me show you what a normal transit in Kepler data looks like. On this graph on the left hand side you have the amount of light  and on the bottom is time. The white line is light just from the star  what astronomers call a light curve. Now  when a planet transits a star  it blocks out a little bit of this light  and the depth of this transit reflects the size of the object itself. And so  for example  let's take Jupiter. Planets don't get much bigger than Jupiter. Jupiter will make a one percent drop in a star's brightness. Earth  on the other hand  is    times smaller than Jupiter  and the signal is barely visible in the data. So back to our mystery. A few years ago  Planet Hunters were sifting through data looking for transits  and they spotted a mysterious signal coming from the star KIC        . The observations in May of      were the first they spotted  and they started talking about this in the discussion forums. They said and object like Jupiter would make a drop like this in the star's light  but they were also saying it was giant. You see  transits normally only last for a few hours  and this one lasted for almost a week. They were also saying that it looks asymmetric  meaning that instead of the clean  U shaped dip that we saw with Jupiter  it had this strange slope that you can see on the left side. This seemed to indicate that whatever was getting in the way and blocking the starlight was not circular like a planet. There are few more dips that happened  but for a couple of years  it was pretty quiet. And then in March of       we see this. The star's light drops by a whole    percent  and this is huge compared to a planet  which would only make a one percent drop. We described this feature as both smooth and clean. It also is asymmetric  having a gradual dimming that lasts almost a week  and then it snaps right back up to normal in just a matter of days. And again  after this  not much happens until February of     . Things start to get really crazy. There is a huge complex of dips in the light curve that appear  and they last for like a hundred days  all the way up into the Kepler mission's end. These dips have variable shapes. Some are very sharp  and some are broad  and they also have variable durations. Some last just for a day or two  and some for more than a week. And there's also up and down trends within some of these dips  almost like several independent events were superimposed on top of each other. And at this time  this star drops in its brightness over    percent. This means that whatever is blocking its light has an area of over       times the area of our planet Earth. This is truly remarkable. And so the citizen scientists  when they saw this  they notified the science team that they found something weird enough that it might be worth following up. And so when the science team looked at it  we're like   Yeah  there's probably just something wrong with the data.  But we looked really  really  really hard  and the data were good. And so what was happening had to be astrophysical  meaning that something in space was getting in the way and blocking starlight. And so at this point  we set out to learn everything we could about the star to see if we could find any clues to what was going on. And the citizen scientists who helped us in this discovery  they joined along for the ride watching science in action firsthand. First  somebody said  you know  what if this star was very young and it still had the cloud of material it was born from surrounding it. And then somebody else said  well  what if the star had already formed planets  and two of these planets had collided  similar to the Earth Moon forming event. Well  both of these theories could explain part of the data  but the difficulties were that the star showed no signs of being young  and there was no glow from any of the material that was heated up by the star's light  and you would expect this if the star was young or if there was a collision and a lot of dust was produced. And so somebody else said  well  how about a huge swarm of comets that are passing by this star in a very elliptical orbit  Well  it ends up that this is actually consistent with our observations. But I agree  it does feel a little contrived. You see  it would take hundreds of comets to reproduce what we're observing. And these are only the comets that happen to pass between us and the star. And so in reality  we're talking thousands to tens of thousands of comets. But of all the bad ideas we had  this one was the best. And so we went ahead and published our findings. Now  let me tell you  this was one of the hardest papers I ever wrote. Scientists are meant to publish results  and this situation was far from that. And so we decided to give it a catchy title  and we called it   Where's The Flux   I will let you work out the acronym. So this isn't the end of the story. Around the same time I was writing this paper  I met with a colleague of mine  Jason Wright  and he was also writing a paper on Kepler data. And he was saying that with Kepler's extreme precision  it could actually detect alien megastructures around stars  but it didn't. And then I showed him this weird data that our citizen scientists had found  and he said to me   Aw crap  Tabby. Now I have to rewrite my paper.  So yes  the natural explanations were weak  and we were curious now. So we had to find a way to rule out aliens. So together  we convinced a colleague of ours who works on SETI  the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence  that this would be an extraordinary target to pursue. We wrote a proposal to observe the star with the world's largest radio telescope at the Green Bank Observatory. A couple months later  news of this proposal got leaked to the press and now there are thousands of articles  over        articles  on this star alone. And if you search Google Images  this is what you'll find. Now  you may be wondering  OK  Tabby  well  how do aliens actually explain this light curve  OK  well  imagine a civilization that's much more advanced than our own. In this hypothetical circumstance  this civilization would have exhausted the energy supply of their home planet  so where could they get more energy  Well  they have a host star just like we have a sun  and so if they were able to capture more energy from this star  then that would solve their energy needs. So they would go and build huge structures. These giant megastructures  like ginormous solar panels  are called Dyson spheres. This image above are lots of artists' impressions of Dyson spheres. It's really hard to provide perspective on the vastness of these things  but you can think of it this way. The Earth Moon distance is a quarter of a million miles. The simplest element on one of these structures is     times that size. They're enormous. And now imagine one of these structures in motion around a star. You can see how it would produce anomalies in the data such as uneven  unnatural looking dips. But it remains that even alien megastructures cannot defy the laws of physics. You see  anything that uses a lot of energy is going to produce heat  and we don't observe this. But it could be something as simple as they're just reradiating it away in another direction  just not at Earth. Another idea that's one of my personal favorites is that we had just witnessed an interplanetary space battle and the catastrophic destruction of a planet. Now  I admit that this would produce a lot of dust that we don't observe. But if we're already invoking aliens in this explanation  then who is to say they didn't efficiently clean up all this mess for recycling purposes  You can see how this quickly captures your imagination. Well  there you have it. We're in a situation that could unfold to be a natural phenomenon we don't understand or an alien technology we don't understand. Personally  as a scientist  my money is on the natural explanation. But don't get me wrong  I do think it would be awesome to find aliens. Either way  there is something new and really interesting to discover. So what happens next  We need to continue to observe this star to learn more about what's happening. But professional astronomers  like me  we have limited resources for this kind of thing  and Kepler is on to a different mission. And I'm happy to say that once again  citizen scientists have come in and saved the day. You see  this time  amateur astronomers with their backyard telescopes stepped up immediately and started observing this star nightly at their own facilities  and I am so excited to see what they find. What's amazing to me is that this star would have never been found by computers because we just weren't looking for something like this. And what's more exciting is that there's more data to come. There are new missions that are coming up that are observing millions more stars all over the sky. And just think  What will it mean when we find another star like this  And what will it mean if we don't find another star like this  Thank you.  On April         we saw the largest data leak in history.   The Panama Papers exposed rich and powerful people   hiding vast amounts of money in offshore accounts.   What does this mean    We called Robert Palmer of Global Witness to explain.  This week  there have been a whole slew and deluge of stories coming out from the leak of    million documents from a Panamanian based law firm called Mossack Fonseca. The release of these papers from Panama lifts the veil on a tiny piece of the secretive offshore world. We get an insight into how clients and banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say   OK  we want an anonymous company  can you give us one   So you actually get to see the emails  you get to see the exchanges of messages  you get to see the mechanics of how this works  how this operates. Now  this has already started to have pretty immediate repercussions. The Prime Minister of Iceland has resigned. We've also had news that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad has also got offshore companies. There's been allegations of a    billion money trail that leads back to President Vladimir Putin of Russia via his close childhood friend  who happens to be a top cellist. And there will be a lot of rich individuals out there and others who will be nervous about the next set of stories and the next set of leaked documents. Now  this sounds like the plot of a spy thriller or a John Grisham novel. It seems very distant from you  me  ordinary people. Why should we care about this  But the truth is that if rich and powerful individuals are able to keep their money offshore and not pay the taxes that they should  it means that there is less money for vital public services like healthcare  education  roads. And that affects all of us. Now  for my organization Global Witness  this expos  has been phenomenal. We have the world's media and political leaders talking about how individuals can use offshore secrecy to hide and disguise their assets    something we have been talking about and exposing for a decade. Now  I think a lot of people find this entire world baffling and confusing  and hard to understand how this sort of offshore world works. I like to think of it a bit like a Russian doll. So you can have one company stacked inside another company  stacked inside another company  making it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures. It can be very difficult for law enforcement or tax authorities  journalists  civil society to really understand what's going on. I also think it's interesting that there's been less coverage of this issue in the United States. And that's perhaps because some prominent US people just haven't figured in this expos   in this scandal. Now  that's not because there are no rich Americans who are stashing their assets offshore. It's just because of the way in which offshore works  Mossack Fonseca has fewer American clients. I think if we saw leaks from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware or Wyoming or Nevada  you would see many more cases and examples linking back to Americans. In fact  in a number of US states you need less information  you need to provide less information to get a company than you do to get a library card. That sort of secrecy in America has allowed employees of school districts to rip off schoolchildren. It has allowed scammers to rip off vulnerable investors. This is the sort of behavior that affects all of us. Now  at Global Witness  we wanted to see what this actually looked like in practice. How does this actually work  So what we did is we sent in an undercover investigator to    Manhattan law firms. Our investigator posed as an African minister who wanted to move suspect funds into the United States to buy a house  a yacht  a jet. Now  what was truly shocking was that all but one of those lawyers provided our investigator with suggestions on how to move those suspect funds. These were all preliminary meetings  and none of the lawyers took us on as a client and of course no money moved hands  but it really shows the problem with the system. It's also important to not just think about this as individual cases. This is not just about an individual lawyer who's spoken to our undercover investigator and provided suggestions. It's not just about a particular senior politician who's been caught up in a scandal. This is about how a system works  that entrenches corruption  tax evasion  poverty and instability. And in order to tackle this  we need to change the game. We need to change the rules of the game to make this sort of behavior harder. This may seem like doom and gloom  like there's nothing we can do about it  like nothing has ever changed  like there will always be rich and powerful individuals. But as a natural optimist  I do see that we are starting to get some change. Over the last couple of years  we've seen a real push towards greater transparency when it comes to company ownership. This issue was put on the political agenda by the UK Prime Minister David Cameron at a big G  Summit that was held in Northern Ireland in     . And since then  the European Union is going to be creating central registers at a national level of who really owns and controls companies across Europe. One of the things that is sad is that  actually  the US is lagging behind. There's bipartisan legislation that had been introduced in the House and the Senate  but it isn't making as much progress as we'd like to see. So we'd really want to see the Panama leaks  this huge peek into the offshore world  be used as a way of opening up in the US and around the world. For us at Global Witness  this is a moment for change. We need ordinary people to get angry at the way in which people can hide their identity behind secret companies. We need business leaders to stand up and say   Secrecy like this is not good for business.  We need political leaders to recognize the problem  and to commit to changing the law to open up this sort of secrecy. Together  we can end the secrecy that is currently allowing tax evasion  corruption  money laundering to flourish. Chris Anderson  This is such a strange thing. Your software  Linux  is in millions of computers  it probably powers much of the Internet. And I think that there are  like  a billion and a half active Android devices out there. Your software is in every single one of them. It's kind of amazing. You must have some amazing software headquarters driving all this. That's what I thought    and I was shocked when I saw a picture of it. I mean  this is    this is the Linux world headquarters. Linus Torvalds  It really doesn't look like much. And I have to say  the most interesting part in this picture  that people mostly react to  is the walking desk. It is the most interesting part in my office and I'm not actually using it anymore. And I think the two things are related. The way I work is ... I want to not have external stimulation. You can kind of see  on the walls are this light green. I'm told that at mental institutions they use that on the walls. It's like a calming color  it's not something that really stimulates you. What you can't see is the computer here  you only see the screen  but the main thing I worry about in my computer is    it doesn't have to be big and powerful  although I like that    it really has to be completely silent. I know people who work for Google and they have their own small data center at home  and I don't do that. My office is the most boring office you'll ever see. And I sit there alone in the quiet. If the cat comes up  it sits in my lap. And I want to hear the cat purring  not the sound of the fans in the computer. CA  So this is astonishing  because working this way  you're able to run this vast technology empire    it is an empire    so that's an amazing testament to the power of open source. Tell us how you got to understand open source and how it lead to the development of Linux. LT  I mean  I still work alone. Really    I work alone in my house  often in my bathrobe. When a photographer shows up  I dress up  so I have clothes on. And that's how I've always worked. I mean  this was how I started Linux  too. I did not start Linux as a collaborative project. I started it as one in a series of many projects I had done at the time for myself  partly because I needed the end result  but even more because I just enjoyed programming. So it was about the end of the journey  which     years later  we still have not reached. But it was really about the fact that I was looking for a project on my own and there was no open source  really  on my radar at all. And what happened is ... the project grows and becomes something you want to show off to people. Really  this is more of a   Wow  look at what I did   And trust me    it was not that great back then. I made it publicly available  and it wasn't even open source at that point. At that point it was source that was open  but there was no intention behind using the kind of open source methodology that we think of today to improve it. It was more like   Look  I've been working on this for half a year  I'd love to have comments.  And other people approached me. At the University of Helsinki  I had a friend who was one of the open source    it was called mainly  free software  back then    and he actually introduced me to the notion that  hey  you can use these open source licenses that had been around. And I thought about it for a while. I was actually worried about the whole commercial interests coming in. I mean  that's one of the worries I think most people who start out have  is that they worry about somebody taking advantage of their work  right  And I decided   What the hell   And    CA  And then at some point  someone contributed some code that you thought   Wow  that really is interesting  I would not have thought of that. This could actually improve this.  LT  It didn't even start by people contributing code  it was more that people started contributing ideas. And just the fact that somebody else takes a look at your project    and I'm sure it's true of other things  too  but it's definitely true in code    is that somebody else takes an interest in your code  looks at it enough to actually give you feedback and give you ideas. That was a huge thing for me. I was    at the time  so I was young  but I had already programmed for half my life  basically. And every project before that had been completely personal and it was a revelation when people just started commenting  started giving feedback on your code. And even before they started giving code back  that was  I think  one of the big moments where I said   I love other people   Don't get me wrong    I'm actually not a people person. I don't really love other people    But I love computers  I love interacting with other people on email  because it kind of gives you that buffer. But I do love other people who comment and get involved in my project. And it made it so much more. CA  So was there a moment when you saw what was being built and it suddenly started taking off  and you thought   Wait a sec  this actually could be something huge  not just a personal project that I'm getting nice feedback on  but a kind of explosive development in the whole technology world   LT  Not really. I mean  the big point for me  really  was not when it was becoming huge  it was when it was becoming little. The big point for me was not being alone and having     maybe     people being involved    that was a big point. Then everything else was very gradual. Going from     people to a million people is not a big deal    to me. Well  I mean  maybe it is if you're    If you want to sell your result then it's a huge deal    don't get me wrong. But if you're interested in the technology and you're interested in the project  the big part was getting the community. Then the community grew gradually. And there's actually not a single point where I went like   Wow  that just took off   because it    I mean    it took a long time  relatively. CA  So all the technologists that I talk to really credit you with massively changing their work. And it's not just Linux  it's this thing called Git  which is this management system for software development. Tell us briefly about that and your role in that. LT  So one of the issues we had  and this took a while to start to appear  is when you ... When you grow from having    people or     people working on a project to having        people  which    I mean  right now we're in the situation where just on the kernel  we have       people involved in every single release and that's every two months  roughly two or three months. Some of those people don't do a lot. There's a lot of people who make small  small changes. But to maintain this  the scale changes how you have to maintain it. And we went through a lot of pain. And there are whole projects that do only source code maintenance. CVS is the one that used to be the most commonly used  and I hated CVS with a passion and refused to touch it and tried something else that was radical and interesting and everybody else hated. CA   Laughs  LT  And we were in this bad spot  where we had thousands of people who wanted to participate  but in many ways  I was the kind of break point  where I could not scale to the point where I could work with thousands of people. So Git is my second big project  which was only created for me to maintain my first big project. And this is literally how I work. I don't code for    well  I do code for fun    but I want to code for something meaningful so every single project I've ever done has been something I needed and    CA  So really  both Linux and Git kind of arose almost as an unintended consequence of your desire not to have to work with too many people. LT  Absolutely. Yes. CA  That's amazing. LT  Yeah. And yet  you're the man who's transformed technology not just once but twice  and we have to try and understand why it is. You've given us some clues  but ... Here's a picture of you as a kid  with a Rubik's Cube. You mentioned that you've been programming since you were like    or     half your life. Were you this sort of computer genius  you know   bernerd  were you the star at school who could do everything  What were you like as a kid  LT  Yeah  I think I was the prototypical nerd. I mean  I was ... I was not a people person back then. That's my younger brother. I was clearly more interested in the Rubik's Cube than my younger brother. My younger sister  who's not in the picture  when we had family meetings    and it's not a huge family  but I have  like  a couple of cousins    she would prep me beforehand. Like  before I stepped into the room she would say   OK. That's so and so ...  Because I was not    I was a geek. I was into computers  I was into math  I was into physics. I was good at that. I don't think I was particularly exceptional. Apparently  my sister said that my biggest exceptional quality was that I would not let go. CA  OK  so let's go there  because that's interesting. You would not let go. So that's not about being a geek and being smart  that's about being ... stubborn  LT  That's about being stubborn. That's about  like  just starting something and not saying   OK  I'm done  let's do something else    Look  shiny   And I notice that in many other parts in my life  too. I lived in Silicon Valley for seven years. And I worked for the same company  in Silicon Valley  for the whole time. That is unheard of. That's not how Silicon Valley works. The whole point of Silicon Valley is that people jump between jobs to kind of mix up the pot. And that's not the kind of person I am. CA  But during the actual development of Linux itself  that stubbornness sometimes brought you in conflict with other people. Talk about that a bit. Was that essential to sort of maintain the quality of what was being built  How would you describe what happened  LT  I don't know if it's essential. Going back to the  I'm not a people person      sometimes I'm also ... shall we say   myopic  when it comes to other people's feelings  and that sometimes makes you say things that hurt other people. And I'm not proud of that. But  at the same time  it's    I get people who tell me that I should be nice. And then when I try to explain to them that maybe you're nice  maybe you should be more aggressive  they see that as me being not nice. What I'm trying to say is we are different. I'm not a people person  it's not something I'm particularly proud of  but it's part of me. And one of the things I really like about open source is it really allows different people to work together. We don't have to like each other    and sometimes we really don't like each other. Really    I mean  there are very  very heated arguments. But you can  actually  you can find things that    you don't even agree to disagree  it's just that you're interested in really different things. And coming back to the point where I said earlier that I was afraid of commercial people taking advantage of your work  it turned out  and very quickly turned out  that those commercial people were lovely  lovely people. And they did all the things that I was not at all interested in doing  and they had completely different goals. And they used open source in ways that I just did not want to go. But because it was open source they could do it  and it actually works really beautifully together. And I actually think it works the same way. You need to have the people people  the communicators  the warm and friendly people who like    really want to hug you and get you into the community. But that's not everybody. And that's not me. I care about the technology. There are people who care about the UI. I can't do UI to save my life. I mean  if I was stranded on an island and the only way to get off that island was the make a pretty UI  I'd die there. So there's different kinds of people  and I'm not making excuses  I'm trying to explain. CA  Now  when we talked last week  you talked about some other trait that you have  which I found really interesting. It's this idea called taste. And I've just got a couple of images here. I think this is an example of not particularly good taste in code  and this one is better taste  which one can immediately see. What is the difference between these two  LT  So this is    How many people here actually have coded  CA  Oh my goodness. LT  So I guarantee you  everybody who raised their hand  they have done what's called a singly linked list. And it's taught    This  the first not very good taste approach  is basically how it's taught to be done when you start out coding. And you don't have to understand the code. The most interesting part to me is the last if statement. Because what happens in a singly linked list    this is trying to remove an existing entry from a list    and there's a difference between if it's the first entry or whether it's an entry in the middle. Because if it's the first entry  you have to change the pointer to the first entry. If it's in the middle  you have to change the pointer of a previous entry. So they're two completely different cases. CA  And that's better. LT  And this is better. It does not have the if statement. And it doesn't really matter    I don't want you understand why it doesn't have the if statement  but I want you to understand that sometimes you can see a problem in a different way and rewrite it so that a special case goes away and becomes the normal case. And that's good code. But this is simple code. This is CS    . This is not important    although  details are important. To me  the sign of people I really want to work with is that they have good taste  which is how ... I sent you this stupid example that is not relevant because it's too small. Good taste is much bigger than this. Good taste is about really seeing the big patterns and kind of instinctively knowing what's the right way to do things. CA  OK  so we're putting the pieces together here now. You have taste  in a way that's meaningful to software people. You're    LT  I think it was meaningful to some people here. CA  You're a very smart computer coder  and you're hellish stubborn. But there must be something else. I mean  you've changed the future. You must have the ability of these grand visions of the future. You're a visionary  right  LT  I've actually felt slightly uncomfortable at TED for the last two days  because there's a lot of vision going on  right  And I am not a visionary. I do not have a five year plan. I'm an engineer. And I think it's really    I mean    I'm perfectly happy with all the people who are walking around and just staring at the clouds and looking at the stars and saying   I want to go there.  But I'm looking at the ground  and I want to fix the pothole that's right in front of me before I fall in. This is the kind of person I am. CA  So you spoke to me last week about these two guys. Who are they and how do you relate to them  LT  Well  so this is kind of clich  in technology  the whole Tesla versus Edison  where Tesla is seen as the visionary scientist and crazy idea man. And people love Tesla. I mean  there are people who name their companies after him. The other person there is Edison  who is actually often vilified for being kind of pedestrian and is    I mean  his most famous quote is   Genius is one percent inspiration and    percent perspiration.  And I'm in the Edison camp  even if people don't always like him. Because if you actually compare the two  Tesla has kind of this mind grab these days  but who actually changed the world  Edison may not have been a nice person  he did a lot of things    he was maybe not so intellectual  not so visionary. But I think I'm more of an Edison than a Tesla. CA  So our theme at TED this week is dreams    big  bold  audacious dreams. You're really the antidote to that. LT  I'm trying to dial it down a bit  yes. CA  That's good. We embrace you  we embrace you. Companies like Google and many others have made  arguably  like  billions of dollars out of your software. Does that piss you off  LT  No. No  it doesn't piss me off for several reasons. And one of them is  I'm doing fine. I'm really doing fine. But the other reason is    I mean  without doing the whole open source and really letting go thing  Linux would never have been what it is. And it's brought experiences I don't really enjoy  public talking  but at the same time  this is an experience. Trust me. So there's a lot of things going on that make me a very happy man and thinking I did the right choices. CA  Is the open source idea    this is  I think we'll end here    is the open source idea fully realized now in the world  or is there more that it could go  are there more things that it could do  LT  So  I'm of two minds there. I think one reason open source works so well in code is that at the end of the day  code tends to be somewhat black and white. There's often a fairly good way to decide  this is done correctly and this is not done well. Code either works or it doesn't  which means that there's less room for arguments. And we have arguments despite this  right  In many other areas    I mean  people have talked about open politics and things like that    and it's really hard sometimes to say that  yes  you can apply the same principles in some other areas just because the black and white turns into not just gray  but different colors. So  obviously open source in science is making a comeback. Science was there first. But then science ended up being pretty closed  with very expensive journals and some of that going on. And open source is making a comeback in science  with things like arXiv and open journals. Wikipedia changed the world  too. So there are other examples  I'm sure there are more to come. CA  But you're not a visionary  and so it's not up to you to name them. LT  No. It's up to you guys to make them  right  CA  Exactly. Linus Torvalds  thank you for Linux  thank you for the Internet  thank you for all those Android phones. Thank you for coming here to TED and revealing so much of yourself. LT  Thank you. I want to introduce you to an amazing woman. Her name is Davinia. Davinia was born in Jamaica  emigrated to the US at the age of     and now lives just outside of Washington  DC. She's not a high powered political staffer  nor a lobbyist. She'd probably tell you she's quite unremarkable  but she's having the most remarkable impact. What's incredible about Davinia is that she's willing to spend time every single week focused on people who are not her  people not her in her neighborhood  her state  nor even in her country    people she'd likely never meet. Davinia's impact started a few years ago when she reached out to all of her friends on Facebook  and asked them to donate their pennies so she could fund girls' education. She wasn't expecting a huge response  but         pennies later  she's now sent over     girls to school. When we spoke last week  she told me she's become a little infamous at the local bank every time she rocks up with a shopping cart full of pennies. Now    Davinia is not alone. Far from it. She's part of a growing movement. And there's a name for people like Davinia  global citizens. A global citizen is someone who self identifies first and foremost not as a member of a state  a tribe or a nation  but as a member of the human race  and someone who is prepared to act on that belief  to tackle our world's greatest challenges. Our work is focused on finding  supporting and activating global citizens. They exist in every country and among every demographic. I want to make the case to you today that the world's future depends on global citizens. I'm convinced that if we had more global citizens active in our world  then every single one of the major challenges we face    from poverty  climate change  gender inequality    these issues become solvable. They are ultimately global issues  and they can ultimately only be solved by global citizens demanding global solutions from their leaders. Now  some people's immediate reaction to this idea is that it's either a bit utopian or even threatening. So I'd like to share with you a little of my story today  how I ended up here  how it connects with Davinia and  hopefully  with you. Growing up in Melbourne  Australia  I was one of those seriously irritating little kids that never  ever stopped asking   Why   You might have been one yourself. I used to ask my mum the most annoying questions. I'd ask her questions like   Mum  why I can't I dress up and play with puppets all day    Why do you want fries with that    What is a shrimp  and why do we have to keep throwing them on the barbie    And mum    this haircut. Why   The worst haircut  I think. Still terrible. As a  why  kid  I thought I could change the world  and it was impossible to convince me otherwise. And when I was    and in my first year of high school  I started raising money for communities in the developing world. We were a really enthusiastic group of kids  and we raised more money than any other school in Australia. And so I was awarded the chance to go to the Philippines to learn more. It was     . We were taken into a slum in the outskirts of Manila. It was there I became friends with Sonny Boy  who lived on what was literally a pile of steaming garbage.  Smoky Mountain  was what they called it. But don't let the romance of that name fool you  because it was nothing more than a rancid landfill that kids like Sonny Boy spent hours rummaging through every single day to find something  anything of value. That night with Sonny Boy and his family changed my life forever  because when it came time to go to sleep  we simply laid down on this concrete slab the size of half my bedroom with myself  Sonny Boy  and the rest of his family  seven of us in this long line  with the smell of rubbish all around us and cockroaches crawling all around. And I didn't sleep a wink  but I lay awake thinking to myself   Why should anyone have to live like this when I have so much  Why should Sonny Boy's ability to live out his dreams be determined by where he's born  or what Warren Buffett called 'the ovarian lottery '  I just didn't get it  and I needed to understand why. Now  I only later came to understand that the poverty I'd seen in the Philippines was the result of decisions made or not made  man made  by a succession of colonial powers and corrupt governments who had anything but the interests of Sonny Boy at heart. Sure  they didn't create Smoky Mountain  but they may as well have. And if we're to try to help kids like Sonny Boy  it wouldn't work just to try to send him a few dollars or to try to clean up the garbage dump on which he lived  because the core of the problem lay elsewhere. And as I worked on community development projects over the coming years trying to help build schools  train teachers  and tackle HIV and AIDS  I came to see that community development should be driven by communities themselves  and that although charity is necessary  it's not sufficient. We need to confront these challenges on a global scale and in a systemic way. And the best thing I could do is try to mobilize a large group of citizens back home to insist that our leaders engage in that systemic change. That's why  a few years later  I joined with a group of college friends in bringing the Make Poverty History campaign to Australia. We had this dream of staging this small concert around the time of the G   with local Aussie artists  and it suddenly exploded one day when we got a phone call from Bono  the Edge and Pearl Jam  who all agreed to headline our concert. I got a little bit excited that day  as you can see. But to our amazement  the Australian government heard our collective voices  and they agreed to double investment into global health and development    an additional  .  billion dollars. It felt like    It felt like this incredible validation. By rallying citizens together  we helped persuade our government to do the unthinkable  and act to fix a problem miles outside of our borders. But here's the thing  it didn't last. See  there was a change in government  and six years later  all that new money disappeared. What did we learn  We learned that one off spikes are not enough. We needed a sustainable movement  not one that is susceptible to the fluctuating moods of a politician or the hint of an economic downturn. And it needed to happen everywhere  otherwise  every individual government would have this built in excuse mechanism that they couldn't possibly carry the burden of global action alone. And so this is what we embarked upon. And as we embarked upon this challenge  we asked ourselves  how do we gain enough pressure and build a broad enough army to win these fights for the long term  We could only think of one way. We needed to somehow turn that short term excitement of people involved with the Make Poverty History campaign into long term passion. It had to be part of their identity. So in       we cofounded an organization that had exactly that as its goal. And there was only one name for it  Global Citizen. But this is not about any one organization. This is about citizens taking action. And research data tells us that of the total population who even care about global issues  only    percent have done anything about it. It's not that people don't want to act. It's often that they don't know how to take action  or that they believe that their actions will have no effect. So we had to somehow recruit and activate millions of citizens in dozens of countries to put pressure on their leaders to behave altruistically. And as we did so  we discovered something really thrilling  that when you make global citizenship your mission  you suddenly find yourself with some extraordinary allies. See  extreme poverty isn't the only issue that's fundamentally global. So  too  is climate change  human rights  gender equality  even conflict. We found ourselves shoulder to shoulder with people who are passionate about targeting all these interrelated issues. But how did we actually go about recruiting and engaging those global citizens  Well  we used the universal language  music. We launched the Global Citizen Festival in the heart of New York City in Central Park  and we persuaded some of the world's biggest artists to participate. We made sure that these festivals coincided with the UN General Assembly meeting  so that leaders who need to hear our voices couldn't possible ignore them. But there was a twist  you couldn't buy a ticket. You had to earn it. You had to take action on behalf of a global cause  and only once you'd done that could you earn enough points to qualify. Activism is the currency. I had no interest in citizenship purely as some sort of feel good thing. For me  citizenship means you have to act  and that's what we required. And amazingly  it worked. Last year  more than         citizens in the New York area alone earned enough points to qualify. Globally  we've now signed up citizens in over     countries around the world. And last year  we signed up more than         new members each and every week of the whole year. See  we don't need to create global citizens from nothing. We're already everywhere. We just need to be organized and motivated to start acting. And this is where I believe we can learn a lot from Davinia  who started taking action as a global citizen back in     . Here's what she did. It wasn't rocket science. She started writing letters  emailing politicians' offices. She volunteered her time in her local community. That's when she got active on social media and started to collect pennies    a lot of pennies. Now  maybe that doesn't sound like a lot to you. How will that achieve anything  Well  it achieved a lot because she wasn't alone. Her actions  alongside         other global citizens'  led the US government to double their investment into Global Partnership for Education. And here's Dr. Raj Shah  the head of USAID  making that announcement. See  when thousands of global citizens find inspiration from each other  it's amazing to see their collective power. Global citizens like Davinia helped persuade the World Bank to boost their investment into water and sanitation. Here's the Bank's president Jim Kim announcing    billion dollars onstage at Global Citizen  and Prime Minister Modi of India affirmed his commitment to put a toilet in every household and school across India by     . Global citizens encouraged by the late night host Stephen Colbert launched a Twitter invasion on Norway. Erna Solberg  the country's Prime Minister  got the message  committing to double investment into girls' education. Global citizens together with Rotarians called on the Canadian  UK  and Australian governments to boost their investment into polio eradication. They got together and committed     million dollars. But despite all of this momentum  we face some huge challenges. See  you might be thinking to yourself  how can we possibly persuade world leaders to sustain a focus on global issues  Indeed  the powerful American politician Tip O'Neill once said   All politics is local.  That's what always got politicians elected  to seek  gain and hold onto power through the pursuit of local or at very best national interests. I experienced this for the first time when I was    years old. I took a meeting with a then Australian Foreign Minister who shall remain nameless     Alexander Downer  And behind closed doors  I shared with him my passion to end extreme poverty. I said   Minister    Australia has this once in a lifetime opportunity to help achieve the Millennium Development Goals. We can do this.  And he paused  looked down on me with cold  dismissive eyes  and he said   Hugh  no one gives a funk about foreign aid.  Except he didn't use the word  funk.  He went on. He said we need to look after our own backyard first. This is  I believe  outdated  even dangerous thinking. Or as my late grandfather would say  complete BS. Parochialism offers this false dichotomy because it pits the poor in one country against the poor in another. It pretends we can isolate ourselves and our nations from one another. The whole world is our backyard  and we ignore it at our peril. See  look what happened when we ignored Rwanda  when we ignore Syria  when we ignore climate change. Political leaders ought to give a  funk  because the impact of climate change and extreme poverty comes right to our shore. Now  global citizens    they understand this. We live in a time that favors the global citizen  in an age where every single voice can be heard. See  do you remember when the Millennium Development Goals were signed back in the year       The most we could do in those days was fire off a letter and wait for the next election. There was no social media. Today  billions of citizens have more tools  more access to information  more capacity to influence than ever before. Both the problems and the tools to solve them are right before us. The world has changed  and those of us who look beyond our borders are on the right side of history. So where are we  So we run this amazing festival  we've scored some big policy wins  and citizens are signing up all over the world. But have we achieved our mission  No. We have such a long way to go. But this is the opportunity that I see. The concept of global citizenship  self evident in its logic but until now impractical in many ways  has coincided with this particular moment in which we are privileged to live. We  as global citizens  now have a unique opportunity to accelerate large scale positive change around the world. So in the months and years ahead  global citizens will hold world leaders accountable to ensure that the new Global Goals for Sustainable Development are tracked and implemented. Global citizens will partner with the world's leading NGOs to end diseases like polio and malaria. Global citizens will sign up in every corner of this globe  increasing the frequency  quality and impact of their actions. These dreams are within reach. Imagine an army of millions growing into tens of millions  connected  informed  engaged and unwilling to take no for an answer. Over all these years  I've tried to reconnect with Sonny Boy. Sadly  I've been unable to. We met long before social media  and his address has now been relocated by the authorities  as often happens with slums. I'd love to sit down with him  wherever he is  and share with him how much the time I spent on Smoky Mountain inspired me. Thanks to him and so many others  I came to understand the importance of being part of a movement of people    the kids willing to look up from their screens and out to the world  the global citizens. Global citizens who stand together  who ask the question  Why    who reject the naysayers  and embrace the amazing possibilities of the world we share. I'm a global citizen. Are you  Thank you. Strap yourselves in  we're going to Mars. Not just a few astronauts    thousands of people are going to colonize Mars. And I am telling you that they're going to do this soon. Some of you will end up working on projects on Mars  and I guarantee that some of your children will end up living there. That probably sounds preposterous  so I'm going to share with you how and when that will happen. But first I want to discuss the obvious question  Why the heck should we do this     years ago  I gave a TED talk on    ways the world could end suddenly. We are incredibly vulnerable to the whims of our own galaxy. A single  large asteroid could take us out forever. To survive we have to reach beyond the home planet. Think what a tragedy it would be if all that humans have accomplished were suddenly obliterated. And there's another reason we should go  exploration is in our DNA. Two million years ago humans evolved in Africa and then slowly but surely spread out across the entire planet by reaching into the wilderness that was beyond their horizons. This stuff is inside us. And they prospered doing that. Some of the greatest advances in civilization and technology came because we explored. Yes  we could do a lot of good with the money it will take to establish a thriving colony on Mars. And yes we should all be taking far better care of our own home planet. And yes  I worry we could screw up Mars the way we've screwed up Earth. But think for a moment  what we had when John F. Kennedy told us we would put a human on the moon. He excited an entire generation to dream. Think how inspired we will be to see a landing on Mars. Perhaps then we will look back at Earth and see that that is one people instead of many and perhaps then we will look back at Earth  as we struggle to survive on Mars  and realize how precious the home planet is. So let me tell you about the extraordinary adventure we're about to undertake. But first  a few fascinating facts about where we're going. This picture actually represents the true size of Mars compared to Earth. Mars is not our sister planet. It's far less than half the size of the Earth  and yet despite the fact that it's smaller  the surface area of Mars that you can stand on is equivalent to the surface area of the Earth that you can stand on  because the Earth is mostly covered by water. The atmosphere on Mars is really thin        times thinner than on Earth    and it's not breathable  it's    percent carbon dioxide. It's really cold there. The average temperature is minus    degrees  although there is quite a range of temperature. A day on Mars is about as long as a day on Earth  plus about    minutes. Seasons and years on Mars are twice as long as they are on Earth. And for anybody who wants to strap on some wings and go flying one day  Mars has a lot less gravity than on Earth  and it's the kind of place where you can jump over your car instead of walk around it. Now  as you can see  Mars isn't exactly Earth like  but it's by far the most livable other place in our entire solar system. Here's the problem. Mars is a long way away  a thousand times farther away from us than our own moon. The Moon is         miles away and it took Apollo astronauts three days to get there. Mars is     million miles away and it will take us eight months to get there        days. And that's only if we launch on a very specific day  at a very specific time  once every two years  when Mars and the Earth are aligned just so  so the distance that the rocket would have to travel will be the shortest.     days is a long time to spend trapped with your colleagues in a tin can. And meanwhile  our track record of getting to Mars is lousy. We and the Russians  the Europeans  the Japanese  the Chinese and the Indians  have actually sent    rockets there  and the vast majority of them have either missed or crashed. Only about a third of the missions to Mars have been successful. And we don't at the moment have a rocket big enough to get there anyway. We once had that rocket  the Saturn V. A couple of Saturn Vs would have gotten us there. It was the most magnificent machine ever built by humans  and it was the rocket that took us to the Moon. But the last Saturn V was used in      to launch the Skylab space station  and we decided to do something called the shuttle instead of continuing on to Mars after we landed on the Moon. The biggest rocket we have now is only half big enough to get us anything to Mars. So getting to Mars is not going to be easy and that brings up a really interesting question ... how soon will the first humans actually land here  Now  some pundits think if we got there by       that'd be a pretty good achievement. These days  NASA seems to be saying that it can get humans to Mars by     . Maybe they can. I believe that they can get human beings into Mars orbit by     . But frankly  I don't think they're going to bother in      to send a rocket to Mars  because we will already be there. We're going to land on Mars in     . And the reason is this man is determined to make that happen. His name is Elon Musk  he's the CEO of Tesla Motors and SpaceX. Now  he actually told me that we would land on Mars by       but Elon Musk is more optimistic than I am    and that's going a ways    so I'm giving him a couple of years of slack. Still ... you've got to ask yourself  can this guy really do this by      or       Well  let's put a decade with Elon Musk into a little perspective. Where was this    years ago  That's the Tesla electric automobile. In       a lot of people in the automobile industry were saying  we would not have a decent electric car for    years. And where was that  That is SpaceX's Falcon   rocket  lifting six tons of supplies to the International Space Station.    years ago  SpaceX had not launched anything  or fired a rocket to anywhere. So I think it's a pretty good bet that the person who is revolutionizing the automobile industry in less than    years and the person who created an entire rocket company in less than    years will get us to Mars by     . Now  you need to know this  governments and robots no longer control this game. Private companies are leaping into space and they will be happy to take you to Mars. And that raises a really big question. Can we actually live there  Now  NASA may not be able to get us there until       or we may get there a long time before NASA  but NASA has taken a huge responsibility in figuring out how we can live on Mars. Let's look at the problem this way. Here's what you need to live on Earth  food  water  shelter and clothing. And here's what you need to live on Mars  all of the above  plus oxygen. So let's look at the most important thing on this list first. Water is the basis of all life as we know it  and it's far too heavy for us to carry water from the Earth to Mars to live  so we have to find water if our life is going to succeed on Mars. And if you look at Mars  it looks really dry  it looks like the entire planet is a desert. But it turns out that it's not. The soil alone on Mars contains up to    percent water. And a number of orbiters that we still have flying around Mars have shown us    and by the way  that's a real photograph    that lots of craters on Mars have a sheet of water ice in them. It's not a bad place to start a colony. Now  here's a view of a little dig the Phoenix Lander did in       showing that just below the surface of the soil is ice    that white stuff is ice. In the second picture  which is four days later than the first picture  you can see that some of it is evaporating. Orbiters also tell us that there are huge amounts of underground water on Mars as well as glaciers. In fact  if only the water ice at the poles on Mars melted  most of the planet would be under    feet of water. So there's plenty of water there  but most of it's ice  most of it's underground  it takes a lot of energy to get it and a lot of human labor. This is a device cooked up at the University of Washington back in     . It's basically a low tech dehumidifier. And it turns out the Mars atmosphere is often     percent humid. So this device can extract all the water that humans will need simply from the atmosphere on Mars. Next we have to worry about what we will breathe. Frankly  I was really shocked to find out that NASA has this problem worked out. This is a scientist at MIT named Michael Hecht. And he's developed this machine  Moxie. I love this thing. It's a reverse fuel cell  essentially  that sucks in the Martian atmosphere and pumps out oxygen. And you have to remember that CO     carbon dioxide  which is    percent of Mars' atmosphere    CO  is basically    percent oxygen. Now  the next big rover that NASA sends to Mars in      is going to have one of these devices aboard  and it will be able to produce enough oxygen to keep one person alive indefinitely. But the secret to this    and that's just for testing    the secret to this is that this thing was designed from the get go to be scalable by a factor of    . Next  what will we eat  Well  we'll use hydroponics to grow food  but we're not going to be able to grow more than    to    percent of our food there  at least not until water is running on the surface of Mars and we actually have the probability and the capability of planting crops. In the meantime  most of our food will arrive from Earth  and it will be dried. And then we need some shelter. At first we can use inflatable  pressurized buildings as well as the landers themselves. But this really only works during the daytime. There is too much solar radiation and too much radiation from cosmic rays. So we really have to go underground. Now  it turns out that the soil on Mars  by and large  is perfect for making bricks. And NASA has figured this one out  too. They're going to throw some polymer plastic into the bricks  shove them in a microwave oven  and then you will be able to build buildings with really thick walls. Or we may choose to live underground in caves or in lava tubes  of which there are plenty. And finally there's clothing. On Earth we have miles of atmosphere piled up on us  which creates    pounds of pressure on our bodies at all times  and we're constantly pushing out against that. On Mars there's hardly any atmospheric pressure. So Dava Newman  a scientist at MIT  has created this sleek space suit. It will keep us together  block radiation and keep us warm. So let's think about this for a minute. Food  shelter  clothing  water  oxygen ... we can do this. We really can. But it's still a little complicated and a little difficult. So that leads to the next big    really big step    in living the good life on Mars. And that's terraforming the planet  making it more like Earth  reengineering an entire planet. That sounds like a lot of hubris  but the truth is that the technology to do everything I'm about to tell you already exists. First we've got to warm it up. Mars is incredibly cold because it has a very thin atmosphere. The answer lies here  at the south pole and at the north pole of Mars  both of which are covered with an incredible amount of frozen carbon dioxide    dry ice. If we heat it up  it sublimes directly into the atmosphere and thickens the atmosphere the same way it does on Earth. And as we know  CO  is an incredibly potent greenhouse gas. Now  my favorite way of doing this is to erect a very  very large solar sail and focus it    it essentially serves as a mirror    and focus it on the south pole of Mars at first. As the planet spins  it will heat up all that dry ice  sublime it  and it will go into the atmosphere. It actually won't take long for the temperature on Mars to start rising  probably less than    years. Right now  on a perfect day at the equator  in the middle of summer on Mars  temperatures can actually reach    degrees  but then they go down to minus     at night. What we're shooting for is a runaway greenhouse effect  enough temperature rise to see a lot of that ice on Mars    especially the ice in the ground    melt. Then we get some real magic. As the atmosphere gets thicker  everything gets better. We get more protection from radiation  more atmosphere makes us warmer  makes the planet warmer  so we get running water and that makes crops possible. Then more water vapor goes into the air  forming yet another potent greenhouse gas. It will rain and it will snow on Mars. And a thicker atmosphere will create enough pressure so that we can throw away those space suits. We only need about five pounds of pressure to survive. Eventually  Mars will be made to feel a lot like British Columbia. We'll still be left with the complicated problem of making the atmosphere breathable  and frankly that could take       years to accomplish. But humans are amazingly smart and incredibly adaptable. There is no telling what our future technology will be able to accomplish and no telling what we can do with our own bodies. In biology right now  we are on the very verge of being able to control our own genetics  what the genes in our own bodies are doing  and certainly  eventually  our own evolution. We could end up with a species of human being on Earth that is slightly different from the species of human beings on Mars. But what would you do there  How would you live  It's going to be the same as it is on Earth. Somebody's going to start a restaurant  somebody's going to build an iron foundry. Someone will make documentary movies of Mars and sell them on Earth. Some idiot will start a reality TV show. There will be software companies  there will be hotels  there will be bars. This much is certain  it will be the most disruptive event in our lifetimes  and I think it will be the most inspiring. Ask any    year old girl if she wants to go to Mars. Children who are now in elementary school are going to choose to live there. Remember when we landed humans on the Moon  When that happened  people looked at each other and said   If we can do this  we can do anything.  What are they going to think when we actually form a colony on Mars  Most importantly  it will make us a spacefaring species. And that means humans will survive no matter what happens on Earth. We will never be the last of our kind. Thank you. Cancer affects all of us    especially the ones that come back over and over again  the highly invasive and drug resistant ones  the ones that defy medical treatment  even when we throw our best drugs at them. Engineering at the molecular level  working at the smallest of scales  can provide exciting new ways to fight the most aggressive forms of cancer. Cancer is a very clever disease. There are some forms of cancer  which  fortunately  we've learned how to address relatively well with known and established drugs and surgery. But there are some forms of cancer that don't respond to these approaches  and the tumor survives or comes back  even after an onslaught of drugs. We can think of these very aggressive forms of cancer as kind of supervillains in a comic book. They're clever  they're adaptable  and they're very good at staying alive. And  like most supervillains these days  their superpowers come from a genetic mutation. The genes that are modified inside these tumor cells can enable and encode for new and unimagined modes of survival  allowing the cancer cell to live through even our best chemotherapy treatments. One example is a trick in which a gene allows a cell  even as the drug approaches the cell  to push the drug out  before the drug can have any effect. Imagine    the cell effectively spits out the drug. This is just one example of the many genetic tricks in the bag of our supervillain  cancer. All due to mutant genes. So  we have a supervillain with incredible superpowers. And we need a new and powerful mode of attack. Actually  we can turn off a gene. The key is a set of molecules known as siRNA. siRNA are short sequences of genetic code that guide a cell to block a certain gene. Each siRNA molecule can turn off a specific gene inside the cell. For many years since its discovery  scientists have been very excited about how we can apply these gene blockers in medicine. But  there is a problem. siRNA works well inside the cell. But if it gets exposed to the enzymes that reside in our bloodstream or our tissues  it degrades within seconds. It has to be packaged  protected through its journey through the body on its way to the final target inside the cancer cell. So  here's our strategy. First  we'll dose the cancer cell with siRNA  the gene blocker  and silence those survival genes  and then we'll whop it with a chemo drug. But how do we carry that out  Using molecular engineering  we can actually design a superweapon that can travel through the bloodstream. It has to be tiny enough to get through the bloodstream  it's got to be small enough to penetrate the tumor tissue  and it's got to be tiny enough to be taken up inside the cancer cell. To do this job well  it has to be about one one hundredth the size of a human hair. Let's take a closer look at how we can build this nanoparticle. First  let's start with the nanoparticle core. It's a tiny capsule that contains the chemotherapy drug. This is the poison that will actually end the tumor cell's life. Around this core  we'll wrap a very thin  nanometers thin blanket of siRNA. This is our gene blocker. Because siRNA is strongly negatively charged  we can protect it with a nice  protective layer of positively charged polymer. The two oppositely charged molecules stick together through charge attraction  and that provides us with a protective layer that prevents the siRNA from degrading in the bloodstream. We're almost done. But there is one more big obstacle we have to think about. In fact  it may be the biggest obstacle of all. How do we deploy this superweapon  I mean  every good weapon needs to be targeted  we have to target this superweapon to the supervillain cells that reside in the tumor. But our bodies have a natural immune defense system  cells that reside in the bloodstream and pick out things that don't belong  so that it can destroy or eliminate them. And guess what  Our nanoparticle is considered a foreign object. We have to sneak our nanoparticle past the tumor defense system. We have to get it past this mechanism of getting rid of the foreign object by disguising it. So we add one more negatively charged layer around this nanoparticle  which serves two purposes. First  this outer layer is one of the naturally charged  highly hydrated polysaccharides that resides in our body. It creates a cloud of water molecules around the nanoparticle that gives us an invisibility cloaking effect. This invisibility cloak allows the nanoparticle to travel through the bloodstream long and far enough to reach the tumor  without getting eliminated by the body. Second  this layer contains molecules which bind specifically to our tumor cell. Once bound  the cancer cell takes up the nanoparticle  and now we have our nanoparticle inside the cancer cell and ready to deploy. Alright  I feel the same way. Let's go  The siRNA is deployed first. It acts for hours  giving enough time to silence and block those survival genes. We have now disabled those genetic superpowers. What remains is a cancer cell with no special defenses. Then  the chemotherapy drug comes out of the core and destroys the tumor cell cleanly and efficiently. With sufficient gene blockers  we can address many different kinds of mutations  allowing the chance to sweep out tumors  without leaving behind any bad guys. So  how does our strategy work  We've tested these nanostructure particles in animals using a highly aggressive form of triple negative breast cancer. This triple negative breast cancer exhibits the gene that spits out cancer drug as soon as it is delivered. Usually  doxorubicin    let's call it  dox     is the cancer drug that is the first line of treatment for breast cancer. So  we first treated our animals with a dox core  dox only. The tumor slowed their rate of growth  but they still grew rapidly  doubling in size over a period of two weeks. Then  we tried our combination superweapon. A nanolayer particle with siRNA against the chemo pump  plus  we have the dox in the core. And look    we found that not only did the tumors stop growing  they actually decreased in size and were eliminated in some cases. The tumors were actually regressing. What's great about this approach is that it can be personalized. We can add many different layers of siRNA to address different mutations and tumor defense mechanisms. And we can put different drugs into the nanoparticle core. As doctors learn how to test patients and understand certain tumor genetic types  they can help us determine which patients can benefit from this strategy and which gene blockers we can use. Ovarian cancer strikes a special chord with me. It is a very aggressive cancer  in part because it's discovered at very late stages  when it's highly advanced and there are a number of genetic mutations. After the first round of chemotherapy  this cancer comes back for    percent of patients. And it usually comes back in a drug resistant form. High grade ovarian cancer is one of the biggest supervillains out there. And we're now directing our superweapon toward its defeat. As a researcher  I usually don't get to work with patients. But I recently met a mother who is an ovarian cancer survivor  Mimi  and her daughter  Paige. I was deeply inspired by the optimism and strength that both mother and daughter displayed and by their story of courage and support. At this event  we spoke about the different technologies directed at cancer. And Mimi was in tears as she explained how learning about these efforts gives her hope for future generations  including her own daughter. This really touched me. It's not just about building really elegant science. It's about changing people's lives. It's about understanding the power of engineering on the scale of molecules. I know that as students like Paige move forward in their careers  they'll open new possibilities in addressing some of the big health problems in the world    including ovarian cancer  neurological disorders  infectious disease    just as chemical engineering has found a way to open doors for me  and has provided a way of engineering on the tiniest scale  that of molecules  to heal on the human scale. Thank you. In      at Rice University  JFK told the country about a dream he had  a dream to put a person on the moon by the end of the decade. The eponymous moonshot. No one knew if it was possible to do but he made sure a plan was put in place to do it if it was possible. That's how great dreams are. Great dreams aren't just visions  they're visions coupled to strategies for making them real. I have the incredible good fortune to work at a moonshot factory. At X    formerly called Google X    you'll find an aerospace engineer working alongside a fashion designer and former military ops commanders brainstorming with laser experts. These inventors  engineers and makers are dreaming up technologies that we hope can make the world a wonderful place. We use the word  moonshots  to remind us to keep our visions big    to keep dreaming. And we use the word  factory  to remind ourselves that we want to have concrete visions    concrete plans to make them real. Here's our moonshot blueprint. Number one  we want to find a huge problem in the world that affects many millions of people. Number two  we want to find or propose a radical solution for solving that problem. And then number three  there has to be some reason to believe that the technology for such a radical solution could actually be built. But I have a secret for you. The moonshot factory is a messy place. But rather than avoid the mess  pretend it's not there  we've tried to make that our strength. We spend most of our time breaking things and trying to prove that we're wrong. That's it  that's the secret. Run at all the hardest parts of the problem first. Get excited and cheer   Hey  How are we going to kill our project today   We've got this interesting balance going where we allow our unchecked optimism to fuel our visions. But then we also harness enthusiastic skepticism to breathe life  breathe reality into those visions. I want to show you a few of the projects that we've had to leave behind on the cutting room floor  and also a few of the gems that at least so far  have not only survived that process  but have been accelerated by it. Last year we killed a project in automated vertical farming. This is some of the lettuce that we grew. One in nine people in the world suffers from undernourishment. So this is a moonshot that needs to happen. Vertical farming uses    times less water and a hundred times less land than conventional farming. And because you can grow the food close to where it's consumed  you don't have to transport it large distances. We made progress in a lot of the areas like automated harvesting and efficient lighting. But unfortunately  we couldn't get staple crops like grains and rice to grow this way. So we killed the project. Here's another huge problem. We pay enormous costs in resources and environmental damage to ship goods worldwide. Economic development of landlocked countries is limited by lack of shipping infrastructure. The radical solution  A lighter than air  variable buoyancy cargo ship. This has the potential to lower  at least overall  the cost  time and carbon footprint of shipping without needing runways. We came up with this clever set of technical breakthroughs that together might make it possible for us to lower the cost enough that we could actually make these ships    inexpensively enough in volume. But however cheap they would have been to make in volume it turned out that it was going to cost close to     million dollars to design and build the first one.     million dollars is just way too expensive. Because X is structured with these tight feedback loops of making mistakes and learning and new designs  we can't spend     million dollars to get the first data point about whether we're on the right track or not. If there's an Achilles' heel in one our projects  we want to know it now  up front  not way down the road. So we killed this project  too. Discovering a major flaw in a project doesn't always mean that it ends the project. Sometimes it actually gets us onto a more productive path. This is our fully self driving vehicle prototype  which we built without a steering wheel or break pedal. But that wasn't actually our goal when we started. With  .  million people dying on the roads globally every year  building a car that drives itself was a natural moonshot to take. Three and a half years ago  when we had these Lexus  retrofitted  self driving cars in testing  they were doing so well  we gave them out to other Googlers to find out what they thought of the experience. And what we discovered was that our plan to have the cars do almost all the driving and just hand over to the users in case of emergency was a really bad plan. It wasn't safe because the users didn't do their job. They didn't stay alert in case the car needed to hand control back to them. This was a major crisis for the team. It sent them back to the drawing board. And they came up with a beautiful  new perspective. Aim for a car where you're truly a passenger. You tell the car where you want to go  you push a button and it takes you from point A to point B by itself. We're really grateful that we had this insight as early on in the project as we did. And it's shaped everything we've done since then. And now our cars have self driven more than  .  million miles  and they're out everyday on the streets of Mountain View  California and Austin  Texas. The cars team shifted their perspective. This is one of X's mantras. Sometimes shifting your perspective is more powerful than being smart. Take wind energy. It's one of my favorite examples of perspective shifting. There's no way that we're going to build a better standard wind turbine than the experts in that industry. But we found a way to get up higher into the sky  and so get access to faster  more consistent winds  and so more energy without needing hundreds of tons of steel to get there. Our Makani energy kite rises up from its perch by spinning up those propellers along its wing. And it pulls out a tether as it rises  pulling energy up through the tether. Once the tether's all the way out  it goes into crosswind circles in the sky. And now those propellers that lifted it up have become flying turbines. And that sends energy back down the tether. We haven't yet found a way to kill this project. And the longer it survives that pressure  the more excited we get that this could become a cheaper and more deployable form of wind energy for the world. Probably the craziest sounding project we have is Project Loon. We're trying to make balloon powered Internet. A network of balloons in the stratosphere that beam an internet connection down to rural and remote areas of the world. This could bring online as many as four billion more people  who today have little or no internet connection. But you can't just take a cell tower  strap it to a balloon and stick it in the sky. The winds are too strong  it would be blown away. And the balloons are too high up to tie it to the ground. Here comes the crazy moment. What if  instead  we let the balloons drift and we taught them how to sail the winds to go where the needed to go  It turns out the stratosphere has winds that are going in quite different speeds and directions in thin strata. So we hoped that using smart algorithms and wind data from around the world  we could maneuver the balloons a bit  getting them to go up and down just a tiny bit in the stratosphere to grab those winds going in those different directions and speeds. The idea is to have enough balloons so as one balloon floats out of your area  there's another balloon ready to float into place  handing off the internet connection  just like your phone hands off between cell towers as you drive down the freeway. We get how crazy that vision sounds    there's the name of the project to remind us of that. So since       the Loon team has prioritized the work that seems the most difficult and so the most likely to kill their project. The first thing that they did was try to get a Wi Fi connection from a balloon in the stratosphere down to an antenna on the ground. It worked. And I promise you there were bets that it wasn't going to. So we kept going. Could we get the balloon to talk directly to handsets  so that we didn't need the antenna as an intermediary receiver  Yeah. Could we get the balloon bandwidth high enough so it was a real Internet connection  So that people could have something more than just SMS  The early tests weren't even a megabit per second  but now we can do up to    megabits per second. Enough to watch a TED Talk. Could we get the balloons to talk to each other through the sky so that we could reach our signal deeper into rural areas  Check. Could we get balloons the size of a house to stay up for more than     days  while costing less than five percent of what traditional  long life balloons have cost to make  Yes. In the end. But I promise you  you name it  we had to try it to get there. We made round  silvery balloons. We made giant pillow shaped balloons. We made balloons the size of a blue whale. We busted a lot of balloons. Since one of the things that was most likely to kill the Loon project was whether we could guide the balloons through the sky  one of our most important experiments was putting a balloon inside a balloon. So there are two compartments here  one with air and then one with helium. The balloon pumps air in to make itself heavier  or lets air out to make it lighter. And these weight changes allow it to rise or fall  and that simple movement of the balloon is its steering mechanism. It floats up or down  hoping to grab winds going in the speed and direction that it wants. But is that good enough for it to navigate through the world  Barely at first  but better all the time. This particular balloon  our latest balloon  can navigate a two mile vertical stretch of sky and can sail itself to within     meters of where it wants to go from        kilometers away. We have lots more to do in terms of fine tuning the system and reducing costs. But last year  a balloon built inexpensively went around the world    times over     days. So we're going to keep going. Our balloons today are doing pretty much everything a complete system needs to do. We're in discussions with telcos around the world  and we're going to fly over places like Indonesia for real service testing this year. This probably all sounds too good to be true  and you're right. Being audacious and working on big  risky things makes people inherently uncomfortable. You cannot yell at people and force them to fail fast. People resist. They worry.  What will happen to me if I fail  Will people laugh at me  Will I be fired   I started with our secret. I'm going to leave you with how we actually make it happen. The only way to get people to work on big  risky things    audacious ideas    and have them run at all the hardest parts of the problem first  is if you make that the path of least resistance for them. We work hard at X to make it safe to fail. Teams kill their ideas as soon as the evidence is on the table because they're rewarded for it. They get applause from their peers. Hugs and high fives from their manager  me in particular. They get promoted for it. We have bonused every single person on teams that ended their projects  from teams as small as two to teams of more than   . We believe in dreams at the moonshot factory. But enthusiastic skepticism is not the enemy of boundless optimism. It's optimism's perfect partner. It unlocks the potential in every idea. We can create the future that's in our dreams. Thank you very much. I have spent the past    years trying to be invisible. I'm a copy editor. I work at The New Yorker  and copyediting for The New Yorker is like playing shortstop for a Major League Baseball team  every little movement gets picked over by the critics    God forbid you should commit an error. Just to clarify  copy editors don't choose what goes into the magazine. We work at the level of the sentence  maybe the paragraph  the words  the punctuation. Our business is in the details. We put the diaeresis  the double dot  over the  i  in  na ve.  We impose house style. Every publication has a house style. The New Yorker's is particularly distinctive. We sometimes get teased for our style. Imagine    we still spell  teen ager  with a hyphen  as if that word had just been coined. But you see that hyphen in  teen age  and that diaeresis over  co perate   and you know you're reading The New Yorker. Copyediting at The New Yorker is a mechanical process. There is a related role called query proofreading  or page OK'ing. Whereas copyediting is mechanical  query proofreading is interpretive. We make suggestions to the author through the editor to improve the emphasis of a sentence or point out unintentional repetitions and supply compelling alternatives. Our purpose is to make the author look good. Note that we give our proofs not directly to the author  but to the editor. This often creates a good cop bad cop dynamic in which the copy editor    I'll use that as an umbrella term    is invariably the bad cop. If we do our job well  we're invisible  but as soon as we make a mistake  we copy editors become glaringly visible. Here is the most recent mistake that was laid at my door.  Last Tuesday  Sarah Palin  the pre Trump embodiment of populist no nothingism in the Republican Party  endorsed Trump.   Where were The New Yorker's fabled copy editors   a reader wrote.  Didn't the writer mean 'know nothingism'   Ouch. There's no excuse for this mistake. But I like it   no nothingism.  It might be American vernacular for  nihilism.  Here  another reader quotes a passage from the magazine   Ruby was seventy six  but she retained her authoritative bearing  only her unsteady gait belied her age.  He added   Surely  someone at The New Yorker knows the meaning of 'belied ' and that it is the opposite of how it is used in this sentence. Come on  Get it together.  Belie  to give a false impression. It should have been  betrayed.  E.B. White once wrote of commas in The New Yorker   They fall with the precision of knives outlining a body.  And it's true    we get a lot of complaints about commas.  Are there really two commas in 'Martin Luther King  Jr.  Boulevard'   There may not be on the sign  but yes  that is New Yorker style for  Jr.  One wag wrote    Please  could you expel  or  at least  restrain  the comma maniac  on your editorial staff    Ah  well. In this case  those commas are well placed  except that there should not be one between  maniac  and  on.  Also  if we must have commas around  at least   we might change it up by using dashes around that phrase   ...    or  at least  restrain     Perfect. Then there's this   Love you  love your magazine  but can you please stop writing massive numbers as text    two and a half million ...  No. One last cri de coeur from a spelling stickler    Those long stringy things are vocal cords  not chords.   The outraged reader added   I'm sure I'm not the first to write regarding this egregious proofreading error  but I'm equally sure I won't be the last. Fie   I used to like getting mail. There is a pact between writers and editors. The editor never sells out the writer  never goes public about bad jokes that had to be cut or stories that went on too long. A great editor saves a writer from her excesses. Copy editors  too  have a code  we don't advertise our oversights. I feel disloyal divulging them here  so let's have look at what we do right. Somehow  I've gotten a reputation for sternness. But I work with writers who know how to have their way with me. I've known Ian Frazier  or  Sandy   since the early   s. And he's one of my favorites  even though he sometimes writes a sentence that gives a copy editor pause. Here is one from a story about Staten Island after Hurricane Sandy   A dock that had been broken in the middle and lost its other half sloped down toward the water  its support pipes and wires leaning forward like when you open a box of linguine and it slides out.  This would never have got past the grammarian in the days of yore. But what could I do  Technically  the  like  should be an  as   but it sounds ridiculous  as if the author were about to embark on an extended Homeric simile     as when you open a box of linguine.  I decided that the hurricane conferred poetic justice on Sandy and let the sentence stand. Generally  if I think something is wrong  I query it three times. I told Sandy that not long ago in a moment of indiscretion and he said   Only three   So  he has learned to hold out. Recently  he wrote a story for  Talk of the Town   that's the section at the front of the magazine with short pieces on subjects ranging from Ricky Jay's exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum to the introduction of doggie bags in France. Sandy's story was about the return to the Bronx of Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor. There were three things in it that I had to challenge. First  a grammar query. The justice was wearing black and Sandy wrote   Her face and hands stood out like in an old  mostly dark painting.  Now  unlike with the hurricane  with this  like   the author didn't have the excuse of describing hurricane damage.  Like  in this sense is a preposition  and a preposition takes an object  which is a noun. This  like  had to be an  as.   As in an old  mostly dark painting.  Second  a spelling issue. The author was quoting someone who was assisting the justice    It will be just a minute. We are getting the justice mic'ed    Mic'ed  The music industry spells it  mic  because that's how it's spelled on the equipment. I'd never seen it used as a verb with this spelling  and I was distraught to think that  mic'ed  would get into the magazine on my watch. New Yorker style for  microphone  in its abbreviated form is  mike.  Finally  there was a sticky grammar and usage issue in which the pronoun has to have the same grammatical number as its antecedent.  everyone in the vicinity held their breath   Their  is plural and  everyone   its antecedent  is singular. You would never say   Everyone were there.  Everyone was there. Everyone is here. But people say things like   Everyone held their breath  all the time. To give it legitimacy  copy editors call it  the singular 'their '  as if calling it singular makes it no longer plural. It is my job when I see it in print to do my best to eliminate it. I couldn't make it   Everyone held her breath   or  Everyone held his breath   or  Everyone held his or her breath.  Whatever I suggested had to blend in. I asked  through the editor  if the author would consider changing it to  All in the vicinity held their breath   because  all  is plural. Nope. I tried again   All those present held their breath   I thought this sounded vaguely judicial. But the editor pointed out that we could not have  present  and  presence  in the same sentence. When the final proof came back  the author had accepted  as  for  like   and  miked  for  mic'ed.  But on  Everyone held their breath   he stood his ground. Two out of three isn't bad. In the same issue  in that piece on doggie bags in France  there was the gratuitous use of the f word by a Frenchman. I wonder  when the mail comes in  which will have offended the readers more. Thank you. I have one more reason for optimism  climate change. Maybe you don't believe it  but here is the fact. On December           in Paris  under the United Nations      governments got together and unanimously    if you've worked with governments  you know how difficult that is    unanimously decided to intentionally change the course of the global economy in order to protect the most vulnerable and improve the life of all of us. Now  that is a remarkable achievement. But it is even more remarkable if you consider where we had been just a few years ago.       Copenhagen. Who remembers Copenhagen  Well  after years of working toward a climate agreement  the same governments convened in Copenhagen and failed miserably. Why did it fail miserably  For many different reasons  but primarily because of the deeply entrenched divide between the global North and the global South. So now  six months after this failure  I was called in to assume the responsibility of the global climate change negotiations. You can imagine  the perfect moment to start this new job. The global mood on climate change was in the trash can. No one believed that a global agreement could ever be possible. In fact  neither did I. If you promise not to tell anyone outside of this wonderful TED audience  I'm going to divulge a secret that has been gratefully buried by history. On my first press conference  a journalist asked   Um  Ms. Figueres  do you think that a global agreement is ever going to be possible   And without engaging brain  I heard me utter   Not in my lifetime.  Well  you can imagine the faces of my press team who were horrified at this crazy Costa Rican woman who was their new boss. And I was horrified  too. Now  I wasn't horrified at me  because I'm kind of used to myself. I was actually horrified at the consequences of what I had just said  at the consequences for the world in which all our children are going to have to live. It was frankly a horrible moment for me  and I thought  well  no  hang on  hang on. Impossible is not a fact  it's an attitude. It's only an attitude. And I decided right then and there that I was going to change my attitude and I was going to help the world change its attitude on climate change. So I don't know    No  just this  Thanks. I don't know    what you would do if you were told your job is to save the planet. Put that on the job description. And you have full responsibility  but you have absolutely no authority  because governments are sovereign in every decision that they take. Well  I would really love to know what you would do on the first Monday morning  but here's what I did  I panicked. And then I panicked again  because I realized I have no idea how we're going to solve this problem. And then I realized I have no idea how we're going to solve this problem  but I do know one thing  we have got to change the tone of this conversation. Because there is no way you can deliver victory without optimism. And here  I use optimism as a very simple word  but let's understand it in its broader sense. Let's understand it as courage  hope  trust  solidarity  the fundamental belief that we humans can come together and can help each other to better the fate of mankind. Well  you can imagine that I thought that without that  there was no way we were going to get out of the paralysis of Copenhagen. And for six years  I have stubbornly  relentlessly injected optimism into the system  no matter what the questions from the press    and I have gotten better at those    and no matter what the evidence to the contrary. And believe you me  there has been a lot of contrary evidence. But relentless optimism into the system. And pretty soon  we began to see changes happening in many areas  precipitated by thousands of people  including many of you here today  and I thank you. And this TED community will not be surprised if I tell you the first area in which we saw remarkable change was ... technology. We began to see that clean technologies  in particular renewable energy technologies  began to drop price and increase in capacity  to the point where today we are already building concentrated solar power plants that have the capacity to power entire cities  to say nothing of the fact of what we are doing on mobility and intelligent buildings. And with this shift in technologies  we were able to begin to understand that there was a shift in the economic equation  because we were able to recognize that yes  there are huge costs to climate change  and yes  there are compounded risks. But there also are economic advantages and intrinsic benefits  because the dissemination of the clean technologies is going to bring us cleaner air  better health  better transportation  more livable cities  more energy security  more energy access to the developing world. In sum  a better world than what we have now. And with that understanding  you should have witnessed  in fact  part of you were  the spread of ingenuity and excitement that went through  first through nonnational governments  the private sector  captains of industry  insurance companies  investors  city leaders  faith communities  because they all began to understand  this actually can be in their interest. This can actually improve their bottom line. And it wasn't just the usual suspects. I have to tell you I had the CEO of a major  major oil and gas company come to me at the beginning of last year and say    privately  of course    he did not know how he was going to change his company  but he is going to change it  because he's interested in long term viability. Well  now we have a shift in the economic equation  and with that  with broader support from everyone  it did not take very long before we saw that national governments woke up to the fact that this is in their national interest. And when we asked countries to begin to identify how they could contribute to global efforts but based on their national interest      countries out of          countries sent their comprehensive climate change plans  based on their national interest  concurrent with their priorities  consistent with their national sustainable development plans. Well  once you protect the core interests of nations  then you can understand that nations were ready to begin to converge onto a common path  onto a common direction of travel that is going to take us probably several decades  but over those several decades is going to take us into the new economy  into a decarbonized  highly resilient economy  And the national contributions that are currently on the table on behalf of national governments are insufficient to get us to a stabilized climate  but they are only the first step  and they will improve over time. And the measurement  reporting and verification of all of those efforts is legally binding. And the checkpoints that we're going to have every five years to assess collective progress towards our goal are legally binding  and the path itself toward a decarbonized and more resilient economy is legally binding. And here's the more important part  What did we have before  A very small handful of countries who had undertaken very reduced  short term emission reduction commitments that were completely insufficient and furthermore  largely perceived as a burden. Now what do we have  Now we have all countries of the world contributing with different intensities from different approaches in different sectors  but all of them contributing to a common goal and along a path with environmental integrity. Well  once you have all of this in place and you have shifted this understanding  then you see that governments were able to go to Paris and adopt the Paris agreement. So  as I look back over the past six years  first I remember the day the Paris agreement was adopted. I cannot tell you the euphoria in the room.       people jumping out of their seats  crying  clapping  screaming  yelling  torn between euphoria and still disbelief at what they had just seen  because so many people had worked for years towards this  and this was finally their reality. And it wasn't just those who had participated directly. A few weeks ago  I was with a colleague who was trying to decide on a Tahitian pearl that he wanted to give to his wonderful wife Natasha. And once he had finally decided what he was going to buy  the jeweler said to him   You know  you're very lucky that you're buying this now  because these pearls could go extinct very soon because of climate change.   But   the jeweler said   have you heard  the governments have just come to a decision  and Tahiti could have a chance.  Well  what a fantastic confirmation that perhaps  perhaps here is hope  here is a possible chance. I'm the first one to recognize that we have a lot of work still to do. We've only just started our work on climate change. And in fact  we need to make sure that we redouble our efforts over the next five years that are the urgent five years. But I do believe that we have come over the past six years from the impossible to the now unstoppable. And how did we do that  By injecting transformational optimism that allowed us to go from confrontation to collaboration  that allowed us to understand that national and local interests are not necessarily at odds with global needs  and that if we understand that  we can bring them together and we can merge them harmoniously. And as I look forward to other global issues that will require our attention this century    food security  water security  home security  forced migration    I see that we certainly do not know how we are going to solve those problems yet. But we can take a page out of what we have done on climate change and we can understand that we have got to reinterpret the zero sum mentality. Because we were trained to believe that there always are winners and losers  and that your loss is my gain. Well  now that we're in a world in which we have reached planetary boundaries and that we are not just so interconnected  but increasingly interdependent on each other  your loss is no longer my gain. We're either all losers or we all can be winners. But we are going to have to decide between zero and sum. We're going to have to decide between zero benefit for all or living life as the sum of all of us. We've done it once. We can do it again. Thanks. I'm turning    next month  and I have the sense that    is going to be a very good year  a year of fulfillment  realization. I have that sense  not because of anything particular in store for me  but because I read it would be a good year in a      book by Norman Mailer.  He felt his own age  forty four ...  wrote Mailer in  The Armies of the Night    ... felt as if he were a solid embodiment of bone  muscle  heart  mind  and sentiment to be a man  as if he had arrived.  Yes  I know Mailer wasn't writing about me. But I also know that he was  for all of us    you  me  the subject of his book  age more or less in step  proceed from birth along the same great sequence  through the wonders and confinements of childhood  the emancipations and frustrations of adolescence  the empowerments and millstones of adulthood  the recognitions and resignations of old age. There are patterns to life  and they are shared. As Thomas Mann wrote   It will happen to me as to them.  We don't simply live these patterns. We record them  too. We write them down in books  where they become narratives that we can then read and recognize. Books tell us who we've been  who we are  who we will be  too. So they have for millennia. As James Salter wrote   Life passes into pages if it passes into anything.  And so six years ago  a thought leapt to mind  if life passed into pages  there were  somewhere  passages written about every age. If I could find them  I could assemble them into a narrative. I could assemble them into a life  a long life  a hundred year life  the entirety of that same great sequence through which the luckiest among us pass. I was then    years old   an age of discretion   wrote William Trevor. I was prone to meditating on time and age. An illness in the family and later an injury to me had long made clear that growing old could not be assumed. And besides  growing old only postponed the inevitable  time seeing through what circumstance did not. It was all a bit disheartening. A list  though  would last. To chronicle a life year by vulnerable year would be to clasp and to ground what was fleeting  would be to provide myself and others a glimpse into the future  whether we made it there or not. And when I then began to compile my list  I was quickly obsessed  searching pages and pages for ages and ages. Here we were at every annual step through our first hundred years.  Twenty seven ... a time of sudden revelations    sixty two  ... of subtle diminishments.  I was mindful  of course  that such insights were relative. For starters  we now live longer  and so age more slowly. Christopher Isherwood used the phrase  the yellow leaf  to describe a man at     only one century after Lord Byron used it to describe himself at   . I was mindful  too  that life can swing wildly and unpredictably from one year to the next  and that people may experience the same age differently. But even so  as the list coalesced  so  too  on the page  clear as the reflection in the mirror  did the life that I had been living  finding at    that  ... one is less and less sure of who one is   emerging at    from the  ... wasteland of preparation into active life   learning at     ... to close softly the doors to rooms  I would  not be coming back to.  There I was. Of course  there we all are. Milton Glaser  the great graphic designer whose beautiful visualizations you see here  and who today is       all those years  ... a ripening and an apotheosis   wrote Nabokov    noted to me that  like art and like color  literature helps us to remember what we've experienced. And indeed  when I shared the list with my grandfather  he nodded in recognition. He was then    and soon to die  which  wrote Roberto Bola o   ... is the same as never dying.  And looking back  he said to me that  yes  Proust was right that at     we are sure we will not die  just as a thanatologist named Edwin Shneidman was right that at     we are sure we will. It had happened to him  as to them. Now the list is done  a hundred years. And looking back over it  I know that I am not done. I still have my life to live  still have many more pages to pass into. And mindful of Mailer  I await   . Thank you. Some people think that there's a TED Talk formula   Give a talk on a round  red rug.   Share a childhood story.   Divulge a personal secret.   End with an inspiring call to action.  No. That's not how to think of a TED Talk. In fact  if you overuse those devices  you're just going to come across as clich d or emotionally manipulative. But there is one thing that all great TED Talks have in common  and I would like to share that thing with you  because over the past    years  I've had a ringside seat  listening to many hundreds of amazing TED speakers  like these. I've helped them prepare their talks for prime time  and learned directly from them their secrets of what makes for a great talk. And even though these speakers and their topics all seem completely different  they actually do have one key common ingredient. And it's this  Your number one task as a speaker is to transfer into your listeners' minds an extraordinary gift    a strange and beautiful object that we call an idea. Let me show you what I mean. Here's Haley. She is about to give a TED Talk and frankly  she's terrified. Over the course of    minutes        people  many of whom have never seen each other before  are finding that their brains are starting to sync with Haley's brain and with each other. They're literally beginning to exhibit the same brain wave patterns. And I don't just mean they're feeling the same emotions. There's something even more startling happening. Let's take a look inside Haley's brain for a moment. There are billions of interconnected neurons in an impossible tangle. But look here  right here    a few million of them are linked to each other in a way which represents a single idea. And incredibly  this exact pattern is being recreated in real time inside the minds of everyone listening. That's right  in just a few minutes  a pattern involving millions of neurons is being teleported into       minds  just by people listening to a voice and watching a face. But wait    what is an idea anyway  Well  you can think of it as a pattern of information that helps you understand and navigate the world. Ideas come in all shapes and sizes  from the complex and analytical to the simple and aesthetic. Here are just a few examples shared from the TED stage. Sir Ken Robinson    creativity is key to our kids' future. is as important in education as literacy  and we should treat it with the same status. Chris Anderson  Elora Hardy    building from bamboo is beautiful. it's strong  it's elegant  it's earthquake resistant. CA  Chimamanda Adichie    people are more than a single identity. and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue  but that they are incomplete. CA  Your mind is teeming with ideas  and not just randomly. They're carefully linked together. Collectively they form an amazingly complex structure that is your personal worldview. It's your brain's operating system. It's how you navigate the world. And it is built up out of millions of individual ideas. So  for example  if one little component of your worldview is the idea that kittens are adorable  then when you see this  you'll react like this. But if another component of your worldview is the idea that leopards are dangerous  then when you see this  you'll react a little bit differently. So  it's pretty obvious why the ideas that make up your worldview are crucial. You need them to be as reliable as possible    a guide  to the scary but wonderful real world out there. Now  different people's worldviews can be dramatically different. For example  how does your worldview react when you see this image   A woman of faith    an expert   maybe even  a sister   Or  oppressed    brainwashed    a terrorist   CA  Whatever your answer  there are millions of people out there who would react very differently. So that's why ideas really matter. If communicated properly  they're capable of changing  forever  how someone thinks about the world  and shaping their actions both now and well into the future. Ideas are the most powerful force shaping human culture. So if you accept that your number one task as a speaker is to build an idea inside the minds of your audience  here are four guidelines for how you should go about that task  One  limit your talk to just one major idea. Ideas are complex things  you need to slash back your content so that you can focus on the single idea you're most passionate about  and give yourself a chance to explain that one thing properly. You have to give context  share examples  make it vivid. So pick one idea  and make it the through line running through your entire talk  so that everything you say links back to it in some way. Two  give your listeners a reason to care. Before you can start building things inside the minds of your audience  you have to get their permission to welcome you in. And the main tool to achieve that  Curiosity. Stir your audience's curiosity. Use intriguing  provocative questions to identify why something doesn't make sense and needs explaining. If you can reveal a disconnection in someone's worldview  they'll feel the need to bridge that knowledge gap. And once you've sparked that desire  it will be so much easier to start building your idea. Three  build your idea  piece by piece  out of concepts that your audience already understands. You use the power of language to weave together concepts that already exist in your listeners' minds    but not your language  their language. You start where they are. The speakers often forget that many of the terms and concepts they live with are completely unfamiliar to their audiences. Now  metaphors can play a crucial role in showing how the pieces fit together  because they reveal the desired shape of the pattern  based on an idea that the listener already understands. For example  when Jennifer Kahn wanted to explain the incredible new biotechnology called CRISPR  she said   It's as if  for the first time  you had a word processor to edit DNA. CRISPR allows you to cut and paste genetic information really easily.  Now  a vivid explanation like that delivers a satisfying aha moment as it snaps into place in our minds. It's important  therefore  to test your talk on trusted friends  and find out which parts they get confused by. Four  here's the final tip  Make your idea worth sharing. By that I mean  ask yourself the question   Who does this idea benefit   And I need you to be honest with the answer. If the idea only serves you or your organization  then  I'm sorry to say  it's probably not worth sharing. The audience will see right through you. But if you believe that the idea has the potential to brighten up someone else's day or change someone else's perspective for the better or inspire someone to do something differently  then you have the core ingredient to a truly great talk  one that can be a gift to them and to all of us. So  there's an actor called Dustin Hoffman. And years ago  he made this movie which some of you may have heard of  called  The Graduate.  And there's two key scenes in that movie. The first one is the seduction scene. I'm not going to talk about that tonight. The second scene is where he's taken out by the old guy to the pool  and as a young college graduate  the old guy basically says one word  just one word. And of course  all of you know what that word is. It's  plastics.  And the only problem with that is  it was completely the wrong advice. Let me tell you why it was so wrong. The word should have been  silicon.  And the reason it should have been silicon is because the basic patents for semiconductors had already been made  had already been filed  and they were already building them. So Silicon Valley was just being built in       when this movie was released. And the year after the movie was released  Intel was founded. So had the graduate heard the right one word  maybe he would have ended up onstage    oh  I don't know    maybe with these two. So as you're thinking of that  let's see what bit of advice we might want to give so that your next graduate doesn't become a Tupperware salesman. So in       what word of advice would you give people  when you took a college graduate out by the pool and you said one word  just one word  I think the answer would be  lifecode.  So what is  lifecode   Lifecode is the various ways we have of programming life. So instead of programming computers  we're using things to program viruses or retroviruses or proteins or DNA or RNA or plants or animals  or a whole series of creatures. And as you're thinking about this incredible ability to make life do what you want it to do  what it's programmed to do  what you end up doing is taking what we've been doing for thousands of years  which is breeding  changing  mixing  matching all kinds of life forms  and we accelerate it. And this is not something new. This humble mustard weed has been modified so that if you change it in one way  you get broccoli. And if you change it in a second way  you get kale. And if you change it in a third way  you get cauliflower. So when you go to these all natural  organic markets  you're really going to a place where people have been changing the lifecode of plants for a long time. The difference today  to pick a completely politically neutral term     Intelligent design  We're beginning to practice intelligent design. That means that instead of doing this at random and seeing what happens over generations  we're inserting specific genes  we're inserting specific proteins  and we're changing lifecode for very deliberate purposes. And that allows us to accelerate how this stuff happens. Let me just give you one example. Some of you occasionally might think about sex. And we kind of take it for granted how we've changed sex. So we think it's perfectly normal and natural to change it. What's happened with sex over time is    normally  sex equals baby  eventually. But in today's world  sex plus pill equals no baby. And again  we think that's perfectly normal and natural  but that has not been the case for most of human history. And it's not the case for animals. What it is does is it gives us control  so sex becomes separate from conception. And as you're thinking of the consequences of that  then we've been playing with stuff that's a little bit more advanced  like art. Not in the sense of painting and sculpture  but in the sense of assisted reproductive technologies. So what are assisted reproductive technologies  Assisted reproductive technologies are things like in vitro fertilization. And when you do in vitro fertilization  there's very good reasons to do it. Sometimes you just can't conceive otherwise. But when you do that  what you re doing is separating sex  conception  baby. So you haven't just taken control of when you have a baby  you've separated when the baby and where the baby is fertilized. So you've separated the baby from the body from the act. And as you're thinking of other things we've been doing  think about twins. So you can freeze sperm  you can freeze eggs  you can freeze fertilized eggs. And what does that mean  Well  that's a good thing if you're a cancer patient. You're about to go under chemotherapy or under radiation  so you save these things. You don't irradiate them. But if you can save them and you can freeze them  and you can have a surrogate mother  it means that you've decoupled sex from time. It means you can have twins born    oh  in    years  In a hundred years  Two hundred years  And these are three really profound changes that are not  like  future stuff. This is stuff we take for granted today. So this lifecode stuff turns out to be a superpower. It turns out to be this incredibly powerful way of changing viruses  of changing plants  of changing animals  perhaps even of evolving ourselves. It's something that Steve Gullans and I have been thinking about for a while. Let's have some risks. Like every powerful technology  like electricity  like an automobile  like computers  this stuff potentially can be misused. And that scares a lot of people. And as you apply these technologies  you can even turn human beings into chimeras. Remember the Greek myth where you mix animals  Well  some of these treatments actually end up changing your blood type. Or they'll put male cells in a female body or vice versa  which sounds absolutely horrible until you realize  the reason you're doing that is you're substituting bone marrow during cancer treatments. So by taking somebody else's bone marrow  you may be changing some fundamental aspects of yourself  but you're also saving your life. And as you're thinking about this stuff  here's something that happened    years ago. This is Emma Ott. She's a recent college admittee. She's studying accounting. She played two varsity sports. She graduated as a valedictorian. And that's not particularly extraordinary  except that she's the first human being born to three parents. Why  Because she had a deadly mitochondrial disease that she might have inherited. So when you swap out a third person's DNA and you put it in there  you save the lives of people. But you also are doing germline engineering  which means her kids  if she has kids  will be saved and won't go through this. And  their  kids will be saved  and their grandchildren will be saved  and this passes on. That makes people nervous. So    years ago  the various authorities said  why don't we study this for a while  There are risks to doing stuff  and there are risks to not doing stuff  because there were a couple dozen people saved by this technology  and then we've been thinking about it for the next    years. So as we think about it  as we take the time to say   Hey  maybe we should have longer studies  maybe we should do this  maybe we should do that   there are consequences to acting  and there are consequences to not acting. Like curing deadly diseases    which  by the way  is completely unnatural. It is normal and natural for humans to be felled by massive epidemics of polio  of smallpox  of tuberculosis. When we put vaccines into people  we are putting unnatural things into their body because we think the benefit outweighs the risk. Because we've built unnatural plants  unnatural animals  we can feed about seven billion people. We can do things like create new life forms. And as you create new life forms  again  that sounds terribly scary and terribly bothersome  until you realize that those life forms live on your dining room table. Those flowers you've got on your dining room table    there's not a lot that's natural about them  because people have been breeding the flowers to make this color  to be this size  to last for a week. You don't usually give your loved one wildflowers because they don't last a whole lot of time. What all this does is it flips Darwin completely on his head. See  for four billion years  what lived and died on this planet depended on two principles  on natural selection and random mutation. And so what lived and died  what was structured  has now been flipped on its head. And what we've done is created this completely parallel evolutionary system where we are practicing unnatural selection and non random mutation. So let me explain these things. This is natural selection. This is unnatural selection. So what happens with this stuff is  we started breeding wolves thousands of years ago in central Asia to turn them into dogs. And then we started turning them into big dogs and into little dogs. But if you take one of the chihuahuas you see in the Herm s bags on Fifth Avenue and you let it loose on the African plain  you can watch natural selection happen. Few things on Earth are less natural than a cornfield. You will never  under any scenario  walk through a virgin forest and see the same plant growing in orderly rows at the same time  nothing else living there. When you do a cornfield  you're selecting what lives and what dies. And you're doing that through unnatural selection. It's the same with a wheat field  it's the same with a rice field. It's the same with a city  it's the same with a suburb. In fact  half the surface of Earth has been unnaturally engineered so that what lives and what dies there is what we want  which is the reason why you don't have grizzly bears walking through downtown Manhattan. How about this random mutation stuff  Well  this is random mutation. This is Antonio Alfonseca. He's otherwise known as the Octopus  his nickname. He was the Relief Pitcher of the Year in     . And he had a random mutation that gave him six fingers on each hand  which turns out to be really useful if you're a pitcher. How about non random mutation  A non random mutation is beer. It's wine. It's yogurt. How many times have you walked through the forest and found all natural cheese  Or all natural yogurt  So we've been engineering this stuff. Now  the interesting thing is  we get to know the stuff better. We found one of the single most powerful gene editing instruments  CRISPR  inside yogurt. And as we start engineering cells  we're producing eight out of the top    pharmaceutical products  including the stuff that you use to treat arthritis  which is the number one best selling drug  Humira. So this lifecode stuff. It really is a superpower. It really is a way of programming stuff  and there's nothing that's going to change us more than this lifecode. So as you're thinking of lifecode  let's think of five principles as to how we start guiding  and I'd love you to give me more. So  principle number one  we have to take responsibility for this stuff. The reason we have to take responsibility is because we're in charge. These aren't random mutations. This is what we are doing  what we are choosing. It's not   Stuff happened.  It didn't happen at random. It didn't come down by a verdict of somebody else. We engineer this stuff  and it's the Pottery Barn rule  you break it  you own it. Principle number two  we have to recognize and celebrate diversity in this stuff. There have been at least    versions of hominids that have walked around this Earth. Most all of them went extinct except us. But the normal and natural state of this Earth is we have various versions of humans walking around at the same time  which is why most of us have some Neanderthal in us. Some of us have some Denisova in us. And some in Washington have a lot more of it. Principle number three  we have to respect other people's choices. Some people will choose to never alter. Some people will choose to alter all. Some people will choose to alter plants but not animals. Some people will choose to alter themselves. Some people will choose to evolve themselves. Diversity is not a bad thing  because even though we think of humans as very diverse  we came so close to extinction that all of us descend from a single African mother and the consequence of that is there's more genetic diversity in    African chimpanzees than there are in seven billion humans. Principle number four  we should take about a quarter of the Earth and only let Darwin run the show there. It doesn't have to be contiguous  doesn't have to all be tied together. It should be part in the oceans  part on land. But we should not run every evolutionary decision on this planet. We want to have our evolutionary system running. We want to have Darwin's evolutionary system running. And it's just really important to have these two things running in parallel and not overwhelm evolution. Last thing I'll say. This is the single most exciting adventure human beings have been on. This is the single greatest superpower humans have ever had. It would be a crime for you not to participate in this stuff because you're scared of it  because you're hiding from it. You can participate in the ethics. You can participate in the politics. You can participate in the business. You can participate in just thinking about where medicine is going  where industry is going  where we're going to take the world. It would be a crime for all of us not to be aware when somebody shows up at a swimming pool and says one word  just one word  if you don't listen if that word is  lifecode.  Thank you very much. Periods. Blood. Menstruation. Gross. Secret. Hidden. Why  A natural biological process that every girl and woman goes through every month for about half of her life. A phenomenon that is so significant that the survival and propagation of our species depends on it. Yet we consider it a taboo. We feel awkward and shameful talking about it. When I got my first periods  I was told to keep it a secret from others    even from my father and brother. Later when this chapter appeared in our textbooks  our biology teacher skipped the subject. You know what I learned from it  I learned that it is really shameful to talk about it. I learned to be ashamed of my body. I learned to stay unaware of periods in order to stay decent. Research in various parts of India shows that three out of every    girls are not aware of menstruation at the time of their first periods. And in some parts of Rajasthan this number is as high as nine out of    girls being unaware of it. You'd be surprised to know that most of the girls that I have spoken to  who did not know about periods at the time of their first menstruation thought that they have got blood cancer and they're going to die soon. Menstrual hygiene is a very important risk factor for reproductive tract infections. But in India  only    percent of girls and women have access to hygienic ways of managing their periods. If you do the math     percent of girls and women use unhygienic ways to manage their periods. I was one of them. I grew up in a small town called Garhwa  in Jharkhand  where even buying a sanitary napkin is considered shameful. So when I started getting my periods  I began with using rags. After every use I would wash and reuse them. But to store them  I would hide and keep it in a dark  damp place so that nobody finds out that I'm menstruating. Due to repeated washing the rags would become coarse  and I would often get rashes and infections using them. I wore these already for five years until I moved out of that town. Another issue that periods brought in my life those of the social restrictions that are imposed upon our girls and women when they're on their periods. I think you all must be aware of it  but I'll still list it for the few who don't. I was not allowed to touch or eat pickles. I was not allowed to sit on the sofa or some other family member's bed. I had to wash my bed sheet after every period  even if it was not stained. I was considered impure and forbidden from worshipping or touching any object of religious importance. You'll find signposts outside temples denying the entry of menstruating girls and women. Ironically  most of the time it is the older woman who imposes such restrictions on younger girls in a family. After all  they have grown up accepting such restrictions as norms. And in the absence of any intervention  it is the myth and misconception that propagate from generation to generation. During my years of work in this field  I have even come across stories where girls have to eat and wash their dishes separately. They're not allowed to take baths during periods  and in some households they are even secluded from other family members. About    percent of girls and women in India would follow one or more restrictive customs on their periods every month. Can you imagine what this does to the self esteem and self confidence of a young girl  The psychological trauma that this inflicts  affecting her personality  her academic performance and every single aspect of growing up during her early formative years  I religiously followed all these restrictive customs for    years  until a discussion with my partner  Tuhin  changed my perception about menstruation forever. In       Tuhin and I were pursuing our postgraduation in design. We fell in love with each other and I was at ease discussing periods with him. Tuhin knew little about periods. He was astonished to know that girls get painful cramps and we bleed every month. Yeah. He was completely shocked to know about the restrictions that are imposed upon menstruating girls and women by their own families and their society. In order to help me with my cramps  he would go on the Internet and learn more about menstruation. When he shared his findings with me  I realized how little I knew about menstruation myself. And many of my beliefs actually turned out to be myths. That's when we wondered  if we  being so well educated  were so ill informed about menstruation  there would be millions of girls out there who would be ill informed  too. To study    to understand the problem better  I undertook a year long research to study the lack of awareness about menstruation and the root cause behind it. While it is generally believed that menstrual unawareness and misconception is a rural phenomenon  during my research  I found that it is as much an urban phenomenon as well. And it exists with the educated urban class  also. While talking to many parents and teachers  I found that many of them actually wanted to educate girls about periods before they have started getting their menstrual cycle. And    but they lacked the proper means themselves. And since it is a taboo  they feel inhibition and shameful in talking about it. Girls nowadays get their periods in classes six and seven  but our educational curriculum teaches girls about periods only in standard eight and nine. And since it is a taboo  teachers still skip the subject altogether. So school does not teach girls about periods  parents don't talk about it. Where do the girls go  Two decades ago and now    nothing has changed. I shared these finding with Tuhin and we wondered  What if we could create something that would help girls understand about menstruation on their own    something that would help parents and teachers talk about periods comfortably to young girls  During my research  I was collecting a lot of stories. These were stories of experiences of girls during their periods. These stories would make girls curious and interested in talking about menstruation in their close circle. That's what we wanted. We wanted something that would make the girls curious and drive them to learn about it. We wanted to use these stories to teach girls about periods. So we decided to create a comic book  where the cartoon characters would enact these stories and educate girls about menstruation in a fun and engaging way. To represent girls in their different phases of puberty  we have three characters. Pinki  who has not gotten her period yet  Jiya who gets her period during the narrative of the book and Mira who has already been getting her period. There is a fourth character  Priya Didi. Through her  girls come to know about the various aspects of growing up and menstrual hygiene management. While making the book  we took great care that none of the illustrations were objectionable in any way and that it is culturally sensitive. During our prototype testing  we found that the girls loved the book. They were keen on reading it and knowing more and more about periods on their own. Parents and teachers were comfortable in talking about periods to young girls using the book  and sometimes even boys were interested in reading it. The comic book helped in creating an environment where menstruation ceased to be a taboo. Many of the volunteers took this prototype themselves to educate girls and take menstrual awareness workshops in five different states in India. And one of the volunteers took this prototype to educate young monks and took it to this monastery in Ladakh. We made the final version of the book  called  Menstrupedia Comic  and launched in September last year. And so far  more than       girls have been educated by using the book in India and    Thank you. And    different countries. We are constantly translating the book into different languages and collaborating with local organizations to make this book available in different countries.    schools in different parts of India have made this book a part of their school curriculum to teach girls about menstruation. I am amazed to see how volunteers  individuals  parents  teachers  school principals  have come together and taken this menstrual awareness drive to their own communities  have made sure that the girls learn about periods at the right age and helped in breaking this taboo. I dream of a future where menstruation is not a curse  not a disease  but a welcoming change in a girl's life. And I would    And I would like to end this with a small request to all the parents here. Dear parents  if you would be ashamed of periods  your daughters would be  too. So please be period positive. Thank you. How do you find a dinosaur  Sounds impossible  doesn't it  It's not. And the answer relies on a formula that all paleontologists use. And I'm going to tell you the secret. First  find rocks of the right age. Second  those rocks must be sedimentary rocks. And third  layers of those rocks must be naturally exposed. That's it. Find those three things and get yourself on the ground  chances are good that you will find fossils. Now let me break down this formula. Organisms exist only during certain geological intervals. So you have to find rocks of the right age  depending on what your interests are. If you want to find trilobites  you have to find the really  really old rocks of the Paleozoic    rocks between a half a billion and a quarter billion years old. Now  if you want to find dinosaurs  don't look in the Paleozoic  you won't find them. They hadn't evolved yet. You have to find the younger rocks of the Mesozoic  and in the case of dinosaurs  between     and    million years ago. Now  it's fairly easy to find rocks of the right age at this point  because the Earth is  to a coarse degree  geologically mapped. This is hard won information. The annals of Earth history are written in rocks  one chapter upon the next  such that the oldest pages are on bottom and the youngest on top. Now  were it quite that easy  geologists would rejoice. It's not. The library of Earth is an old one. It has no librarian to impose order. Operating over vast swaths of time  myriad geological processes offer every possible insult to the rocks of ages. Most pages are destroyed soon after being written. Some pages are overwritten  creating difficult to decipher palimpsests of long gone landscapes. Pages that do find sanctuary under the advancing sands of time are never truly safe. Unlike the Moon    our dead  rocky companion    the Earth is alive  pulsing with creative and destructive forces that power its geological metabolism. Lunar rocks brought back by the Apollo astronauts all date back to about the age of the Solar System. Moon rocks are forever. Earth rocks  on the other hand  face the perils of a living lithosphere. All will suffer ruination  through some combination of mutilation  compression  folding  tearing  scorching and baking. Thus  the volumes of Earth history are incomplete and disheveled. The library is vast and magnificent    but decrepit. And it was this tattered complexity in the rock record that obscured its meaning until relatively recently. Nature provided no card catalog for geologists    this would have to be invented. Five thousand years after the Sumerians learned to record their thoughts on clay tablets  the Earth's volumes remained inscrutable to humans. We were geologically illiterate  unaware of the antiquity of our own planet and ignorant of our connection to deep time. It wasn't until the turn of the   th century that our blinders were removed  first  with the publication of James Hutton's  Theory of the Earth   in which he told us that the Earth reveals no vestige of a beginning and no prospect of an end  and then  with the printing of William Smith's map of Britain  the first country scale geological map  giving us for the first time predictive insight into where certain types of rocks might occur. After that  you could say things like   If we go over there  we should be in the Jurassic   or   If we go up over that hill  we should find the Cretaceous.  So now  if you want to find trilobites  get yourself a good geological map and go to the rocks of the Paleozoic. If you want to find dinosaurs like I do  find the rocks of Mesozoic and go there. Now of course  you can only make a fossil in a sedimentary rock  a rock made by sand and mud. You can't have a fossil in an igneous rock formed by magma  like a granite  or in a metamorphic rock that's been heated and squeezed. And you have to get yourself in a desert. It's not that dinosaurs particularly lived in deserts  they lived on every land mass and in every imaginable environment. It's that you need to go to a place that's a desert today  a place that doesn't have too many plants covering up the rocks  and a place where erosion is always exposing new bones at the surface. So find those three things  rocks of the right age  that are sedimentary rocks  in a desert  and get yourself on the ground  and you literally walk until you see a bone sticking out of the rock. Here's a picture that I took in Southern Patagonia. Every pebble that you see on the ground there is a piece of dinosaur bone. So when you're in that right situation  it's not a question of whether you'll find fossils or not  you're going to find fossils. The question is  Will you find something that is scientifically significant  And to help with that  I'm going to add a fourth part to our formula  which is this  get as far away from other paleontologists as possible. It's not that I don't like other paleontologists. When you go to a place that's relatively unexplored  you have a much better chance of not only finding fossils but of finding something that's new to science. So that's my formula for finding dinosaurs  and I've applied it all around the world. In the austral summer of       I went to the bottom of South America  to the bottom of Patagonia  Argentina  to prospect for dinosaurs  a place that had terrestrial sedimentary rocks of the right age  in a desert  a place that had been barely visited by paleontologists. And we found this. This is a femur  a thigh bone  of a giant  plant eating dinosaur. That bone is  .  meters across. That's over seven feet long. Now  unfortunately  that bone was isolated. We dug and dug and dug  and there wasn't another bone around. But it made us hungry to go back the next year for more. And on the first day of that next field season  I found this  another two meter femur  only this time not isolated  this time associated with     other bones of a giant plant eater. And after three more hard  really brutal field seasons  the quarry came to look like this. And there you see the tail of that great beast wrapping around me. The giant that lay in this grave  the new species of dinosaur  we would eventually call  Dreadnoughtus schrani.  Dreadnoughtus was    feet from snout to tail. It stood two and a half stories at the shoulder  and all fleshed out in life  it weighed    tons. People ask me sometimes   Was Dreadnoughtus bigger than a T. rex   That's the mass of eight or nine T. rex. Now  one of the really cool things about being a paleontologist is when you find a new species  you get to name it. And I've always thought it a shame that these giant  plant eating dinosaurs are too often portrayed as passive  lumbering platters of meat on the landscape. They're not. Big herbivores can be surly  and they can be territorial    you do not want to mess with a hippo or a rhino or a water buffalo. The bison in Yellowstone injure far more people than do the grizzly bears. So can you imagine a big bull     ton Dreadnoughtus in the breeding season  defending a territory  That animal would have been incredibly dangerous  a menace to all around  and itself would have had nothing to fear. And thus the name   Dreadnoughtus   or   fears nothing.  Now  to grow so large  an animal like Dreadnoughtus would've had to have been a model of efficiency. That long neck and long tail help it radiate heat into the environment  passively controlling its temperature. And that long neck also serves as a super efficient feeding mechanism. Dreadnoughtus could stand in one place and with that neck clear out a huge envelope of vegetation  taking in tens of thousands of calories while expending very few. And these animals evolved a bulldog like wide gait stance  giving them immense stability  because when you're    tons  when you're literally as big as a house  the penalty for falling over is death. Yeah  these animals are big and tough  but they won't take a blow like that. Dreadnoughtus falls over  ribs break and pierce lungs. Organs burst. If you're a big    ton Dreadnoughtus  you don't get to fall down in life    even once. Now  after this particular Dreadnoughtus carcass was buried and de fleshed by a multitude of bacteria  worms and insects  its bones underwent a brief metamorphosis  exchanging molecules with the groundwater and becoming more and more like the entombing rock. As layer upon layer of sediment accumulated  pressure from all sides weighed in like a stony glove whose firm and enduring grip held each bone in a stabilizing embrace. And then came the long ... nothing. Epoch after epoch of sameness  nonevents without number. All the while  the skeleton lay everlasting and unchanging in perfect equilibrium within its rocky grave. Meanwhile  Earth history unfolded above. The dinosaurs would reign for another    million years before their hegemony was snuffed out in a fiery apocalypse. The continents drifted. The mammals rose. The Ice Age came. And then  in East Africa  an unpromising species of ape evolved the odd trick of sentient thought. These brainy primates were not particularly fast or strong. But they excelled at covering ground  and in a remarkable diaspora surpassing even the dinosaurs' record of territorial conquest  they dispersed across the planet  ravishing every ecosystem they encountered  along the way  inventing culture and metalworking and painting and dance and music and science and rocket ships that would eventually take    particularly excellent apes to the surface of the Moon. With seven billion peripatetic Homo sapiens on the planet  it was perhaps inevitable that one of them would eventually trod on the grave of the magnificent titan buried beneath the badlands of Southern Patagonia. I was that ape. And standing there  alone in the desert  it was not lost on me that the chance of any one individual entering the fossil record is vanishingly small. But the Earth is very  very old. And over vast tracts of time  the improbable becomes the probable. That's the magic of the geological record. Thus  multitudinous creatures living and dying on an old planet leave behind immense numbers of fossils  each one a small miracle  but collectively  inevitable. Sixty six million years ago  an asteroid hits the Earth and wipes out the dinosaurs. This easily might not have been. But we only get one history  and it's the one that we have. But this particular reality was not inevitable. The tiniest perturbation of that asteroid far from Earth would have caused it to miss our planet by a wide margin. The pivotal  calamitous day during which the dinosaurs were wiped out  setting the stage for the modern world as we know it didn't have to be. It could've just been another day    a Thursday  perhaps    among the    billion days already enjoyed by the dinosaurs. But over geological time  improbable  nearly impossible events do occur. Along the path from our wormy  Cambrian ancestors to primates dressed in suits  innumerable forks in the road led us to this very particular reality. The bones of Dreadnoughtus lay underground for    million years. Who could have imagined that a single species of shrew like mammal living in the cracks of the dinosaur world would evolve into sentient beings capable of characterizing and understanding the very dinosaurs they must have dreaded  I once stood at the head of the Missouri River and bestraddled it. There  it's nothing more than a gurgle of water that issues forth from beneath a rock in a boulder in a pasture  high in the Bitterroot Mountains. The stream next to it runs a few hundred yards and ends in a small pond. Those two streams    they look identical. But one is an anonymous trickle of water  and the other is the Missouri River. Now go down to the mouth of the Missouri  near St. Louis  and it's pretty obvious that that river is a big deal. But go up into the Bitterroots and look at the Missouri  and human prospection does not allow us to see it as anything special. Now go back to the Cretaceous Period and look at our tiny  fuzzball ancestors. You would never guess that they would amount to anything special  and they probably wouldn't have  were it not for that pesky asteroid. Now  make a thousand more worlds and a thousand more solar systems and let them run. You will never get the same result. No doubt  those worlds would be both amazing and amazingly improbable  but they would not be our world and they would not have our history. There are an infinite number of histories that we could've had. We only get one  and wow  did we ever get a good one. Dinosaurs like Dreadnoughtus were real. Sea monsters like the mosasaur were real. Dragonflies with the wingspan of an eagle and pill bugs the length of a car really existed. Why study the ancient past  Because it gives us perspective and humility. The dinosaurs died in the world's fifth mass extinction  snuffed out in a cosmic accident through no fault of their own. They didn't see it coming  and they didn't have a choice. We  on the other hand  do have a choice. And the nature of the fossil record tells us that our place on this planet is both precarious and potentially fleeting. Right now  our species is propagating an environmental disaster of geological proportions that is so broad and so severe  it can rightly be called the sixth extinction. Only unlike the dinosaurs  we can see it coming. And unlike the dinosaurs  we can do something about it. That choice is ours. Thank you. How much do you need to know about a person before you'd feel comfortable making a loan  Suppose you wanted to lend       dollars to the person sitting two rows behind you. What would you need to know about that person before you'd feel comfortable  My mom came to the US from India in her late thirties. She's a doctor in Brooklyn  and she often lets friends and neighbors come to see her for health services  whether they can pay right away or not. I remember running into her patients with her at the grocery store or on the sidewalk  and sometimes they would come and pay her right on the spot for previous appointments. She would thank them  and ask them about their families and their health. She gave them credit because she trusted them. Most of us are like my mom. We would give credit to someone we know or that we live next to. But most of us are probably not going to lend to a stranger unless we know a little something about them. Banks  credit card companies and other financial institutions don't know us on a personal level  but they do have a way of trusting us  and that's through our credit scores. Our credit scores have been created through an aggregation and analysis of our public consumer credit data. And because of them  we have pretty much easy access to all of the goods and services that we need  from getting electricity to buying a home  or taking a risk and starting a business. But ... there are  .  billion people around the world that don't have a credit score. That's a third of the world's population. They don't have a score because there are no formal public records on them    no bank accounts  no credit histories and no social security numbers. And because they don't have a score  they don't have access to the credit or financial products that can improve their lives. They are not trusted. So we wanted to find a way to build trust and to open up financial access for these  .  billion. So we created a mobile application that builds credit scores for them using mobile data. There are currently over one billion smartphones in emerging markets. And people are using them the same way that we do. They're texting their friends  they're looking up directions  they're browsing the Internet and they're even making financial transactions. Over time  this data is getting captured on our phones  and it provides a really rich picture of a person's life. Our customers give us access to this data and we capture it through our mobile application. It helps us understand the creditworthiness of people like Jenipher  a small business owner in Nairobi  Kenya. Jenipher is    years old  and for decades has been running a food stall in the central business district. She has three sons who she put through vocational school  and she's also the leader of her local chama  or savings group. Jenipher's food stall does well. She makes just enough every day to cover her expenses. But she's not financially secure. Any emergency could force her into debt. And she has no discretionary income to improve her family's way of living  for emergencies  or for investing into growing her business. If Jenipher wants credit  her options are limited. She could get a microloan  but she'd have to form a group that could help vouch for her credibility. And even then  the loan sizes would be way too small to really have an impact on her business  averaging around     dollars. Loan sharks are always an option  but with interest rates that are well above     percent  they're financially risky. And because Jenipher doesn't have collateral or a credit history  she can't walk into a bank and ask for a business loan. But one day  Jenipher's son convinced her to download our application and apply for a loan. Jenipher answered a few questions on her phone and she gave us access to a few key data points on her device. And here's what we saw. So  bad news first. Jenipher had a low savings balance and no previous loan history. These are factors that would have thrown up a red flag to a traditional bank. But there were other points in her history that showed us a much richer picture of her potential. So for one  we saw that she made regular phone calls to her family in Uganda. Well  it turns out that the data shows a four percent increase in repayment among people who consistently communicate with a few close contacts. We could also see that though she traveled around a lot throughout the day  she actually had pretty regular travel patterns  and she was either at home or at her food stall. And the data shows a six percent increase in repayment among customers who are consistent with where they spend most of their time. We could also see that she communicated a lot with many different people throughout the day and that she had a strong support network. Our data shows that people who communicate with more than    different contacts tend to be more likely to be good borrowers. In Jenipher's case  she communicated with    different individuals  which showed a nine percent increase in her repayment. These are just some of the thousands of different data points that we look at to understand a person's creditworthiness. And after analyzing all of these different data points  we took the first risk and gave Jenipher a loan. This is data that would not be found on a paper trail or in any formal financial record. But it proves trust. By looking beyond income  we can see that people in emerging markets that may seem risky and unpredictable on the surface are actually willing and have the capacity to repay. Our credit scores have helped us deliver over         loans in Kenya in just the past year. And our repayment rates are above    percent    which  by the way  is in line with traditional bank repayment rates. With something as simple as a credit score  we're giving people the power to build their own futures. Our customers have used their loans for family expenses  emergencies  travel and for investing back into growing their businesses. They're now building better economies and communities where more people can succeed. Over the past two years of using our product  Jenipher has increased her savings by    percent. She's also started two additional food stalls and is now making plans for her own restaurant. She's applying for a small business loan from a commercial bank  because she now has the credit history to prove she deserves it. I saw Jenipher in Nairobi just last week  and she told me how excited she was to get started. She said   Only my son believed I could do this. I didn't think this was for me.  She's lived her whole life believing that there was a part of the world that was closed off to her. Our job now is to open the world to Jenipher and the billions like her that deserve to be trusted. Thank you. So I'm an artist  but a little bit of a peculiar one. I don't paint. I can't draw. My shop teacher in high school wrote that I was a menace on my report card. You probably don't really want to see my photographs. But there is one thing I know how to do  I know how to program a computer. I can code. And people will tell me that     years ago  folks like me didn't exist  that it was impossible  that art made with data is a new thing  it's a product of our age  it's something that's really important to think of as something that's very  now.  And that's true. But there is an art form that's been around for a very long time that's really about using information  abstract information  to make emotionally resonant pieces. And it's called music. We've been making music for tens of thousands of years  right  And if you think about what music is    notes and chords and keys and harmonies and melodies    these things are algorithms. These things are systems that are designed to unfold over time  to make us feel. I came to the arts through music. I was trained as a composer  and about    years ago  I started making pieces that were designed to look at the intersection between sound and image  to use an image to unveil a musical structure or to use a sound to show you something interesting about something that's usually pictorial. So what you're seeing on the screen is literally being drawn by the musical structure of the musicians onstage  and there's no accident that it looks like a plant  because the underlying algorithmic biology of the plant is what informed the musical structure in the first place. So once you know how to do this  once you know how to code with media  you can do some pretty cool stuff. This is a project I did for the Sundance Film Festival. Really simple idea  you take every Academy Award Best Picture  you speed it up to one minute each and string them all together. And so in    minutes  I can show you the history of Hollywood cinema. And what it really shows you is the history of editing in Hollywood cinema. So on the left  we've got Casablanca  on the right  we've got Chicago. And you can see that Casablanca is a little easier to read. That's because the average length of a cinematic shot in the     s was    seconds  and now it's around six seconds. This is a project that was inspired by some work that was funded by the US Federal Government in the early     s  to look at video footage and find a specific actor in any video. And so I repurposed this code to train a system on one person in our culture who would never need to be surveilled in that manner  which is Britney Spears. I downloaded       paparazzi photos of Britney Spears and trained my computer to find her face and her face alone. I can run any footage of her through it and will center her eyes in the frame  and this sort of is a little double commentary about surveillance in our society. We are very fraught with anxiety about being watched  but then we obsess over celebrity. What you're seeing on the screen here is a collaboration I did with an artist named Li n Amaris. What she did is very simple to explain and describe  but very hard to do. She took    minutes of activity  getting ready for a night out on the town  and stretched it over three days and performed it on a traffic island in slow motion in New York City. I was there  too  with a film crew. We filmed the whole thing  and then we reversed the process  speeding it up to    minutes again  so it looks like she's moving normally and the whole world is flying by. At a certain point  I figured out that what I was doing was making portraits. When you think about portraiture  you tend to think about stuff like this. The guy on the left is named Gilbert Stuart. He's sort of the first real portraitist of the United States. And on the right is his portrait of George Washington from     . This is the so called Lansdowne portrait. And if you look at this painting  there's a lot of symbolism  right  We've got a rainbow out the window. We've got a sword. We've got a quill on the desk. All of these things are meant to evoke George Washington as the father of the nation. This is my portrait of George Washington. And this is an eye chart  only instead of letters  they're words. And what the words are is the    words in George Washington's State of the Union addresses that he uses more than any other president. So  gentlemen  has its own symbolism and its own rhetoric. And it's really kind of significant that that's the word he used the most. This is the eye chart for George W. Bush  who was president when I made this piece. And how you get there  from  gentlemen  to  terror  in    easy steps  tells us a lot about American history  and gives you a different insight than you would have looking at a series of paintings. These pieces provide a history lesson of the United States through the political rhetoric of its leaders. Ronald Reagan spent a lot of time talking about deficits. Bill Clinton spent a lot of time talking about the century in which he would no longer be president  but maybe his wife would be. Lyndon Johnson was the first President to give his State of the Union addresses on prime time television  he began every paragraph with the word  tonight.  And Richard Nixon  or more accurately  his speechwriter  a guy named William Safire  spent a lot of time thinking about language and making sure that his boss portrayed a rhetoric of honesty. This project is shown as a series of monolithic sculptures. It's an outdoor series of light boxes. And it's important to note that they're to scale  so if you stand    feet back and you can read between those two black lines  you have       vision. This is a portrait. And there's a lot of these. There's a lot of ways to do this with data. I started looking for a way to think about how I can do a more democratic form of portraiture  something that's more about my country and how it works. Every    years  we make a census in the United States. We literally count people  find out who lives where  what kind of jobs we've got  the language we speak at home. And this is important stuff    really important stuff. But it doesn't really tell us who we are. It doesn't tell us about our dreams and our aspirations. And so in       I decided to make my own census. And I started looking for a corpus of data that had a lot of descriptions written by ordinary Americans. And it turns out that there is such a corpus of data that's just sitting there for the taking. It's called online dating. So in       I joined    different online dating services  as a gay man  a straight man  a gay woman and a straight woman  in every zip code in America and downloaded about    million people's dating profiles    about    percent of the adult population of the United States. I have obsessive compulsive disorder. This is going to become really freaking obvious. Just go with me. So what I did was I sorted all this stuff by zip code. And I looked at word analysis. These are some dating profiles from      with the word  lonely  highlighted. If you look at these things topographically  if you imagine dark colors to light colors are more use of the word  you can see that Appalachia is a pretty lonely place. You can also see that Nebraska ain't that funny. This is the kinky map  so what this is showing you is that the women in Alaska need to get together with the men in southern New Mexico  and have a good time. And I have this at a pretty granular level  so I can tell you that the men in the eastern half of Long Island are way more interested in being spanked than men in the western half of Long Island. This will be your one takeaway from this whole conference. You're going to remember that fact for  like     years. When you bring this down to a cartographic level  you can make maps and do the same trick I was doing with the eye charts. You can replace the name of every city in the United States with the word people use more in that city than anywhere else. If you've ever dated anyone from Seattle  this makes perfect sense. You've got  pretty.  You've got  heartbreak.  You've got  gig.  You've got  cigarette.  They play in a band and they smoke. And right above that you can see  email.  That's Redmond  Washington  which is the headquarters of the Microsoft Corporation. Some of these you can guess    so  Los Angeles is  acting  and San Francisco is  gay.  Some are a little bit more heartbreaking. In Baton Rouge  they talk about being curvy  downstream in New Orleans  they still talk about the flood. Folks in the American capital will say they're interesting. People in Baltimore  Maryland  will say they're afraid. This is New Jersey. I grew up somewhere between  annoying  and  cynical.  And New York City's number one word is  now   as in   Now I'm working as a waiter  but actually I'm an actor.  Or   Now I'm a professor of engineering at NYU  but actually I'm an artist.  If you go upstate  you see  dinosaur.  That's Syracuse. The best place to eat in Syracuse  New York  is a Hell's Angels barbecue joint called Dinosaur Barbecue. That's where you would take somebody on a date. I live somewhere between  unconditional  and  midsummer   in Midtown Manhattan. And this is gentrified North Brooklyn  so you've got  DJ  and  glamorous  and  hipsters  and  urbane.  So that's maybe a more democratic portrait. And the idea was  what if we made red state and blue state maps based on what we want to do on a Friday night  This is a self portrait. This is based on my email  about         emails sent over    years. You can think of this as a quantified selfie. So what I'm doing is running a physics equation based on my personal data. You have to imagine everybody I've ever corresponded with. It started out in the middle and it exploded with a big bang. And everybody has gravity to one another  gravity based on how much they've been emailing  who they've been emailing with. And it also does sentimental analysis  so if I say  I love you   you're heavier to me. And you attract to my email addresses in the middle  which act like mainline stars. And all the names are handwritten. Sometimes you do this data and this work with real time data to illuminate a specific problem in a specific city. This is a Walther PPK  mm semiautomatic handgun that was used in a shooting in the French Quarter of New Orleans about two years ago on Valentine's Day in an argument over parking. Those are my cigarettes. This is the house where the shooting took place. This project involved a little bit of engineering. I've got a bike chain rigged up as a cam shaft  with a computer driving it. That computer and the mechanism are buried in a box. The gun's on top welded to a steel plate. There's a wire going through to the trigger  and the computer in the box is online. It's listening to the     feed of the New Orleans Police Department  so that anytime there's a shooting reported in New Orleans  the gun fires. Now  there's a blank  so there's no bullet. There's big light  big noise and most importantly  there's a casing. There's about five shootings a day in New Orleans  so over the four months this piece was installed  the case filled up with bullets. You guys know what this is    you call this  data visualization.  When you do it right  it's illuminating. When you do it wrong  it's anesthetizing. It reduces people to numbers. So watch out. One last piece for you. I spent the last summer as the artist in residence for Times Square. And Times Square in New York is literally the crossroads of the world. One of the things people don't notice about it is it's the most Instagrammed place on Earth. About every five seconds  someone commits a selfie in Times Square. That's        a day  and I have them all. These are some of them with their eyes centered. Every civilization  will use the maximum level of technology available to make art. And it's the responsibility of the artist to ask questions about what that technology means and how it reflects our culture. So I leave you with this  we're more than numbers. We're people  and we have dreams and ideas. And reducing us to statistics is something that's done at our peril. Thank you very much. Hello. This is my first trip  first time in life I'm outside of the walls of Gaza. I'm so happy to be here. My ambition always was to be a pilot  to fly a plane  to feel free to fly the sky  to touch the sky. But that didn't happen. Simply  I live in Gaza  there is no airport. All borders are closed on every side. We live in one of the biggest prisons in the world. The only thing I can do is just to look up to the sky. On some days  we are lucky if we have electricity for four or five hours. When it's cold  we make a fire on the front or on the roof of our homes. Sometimes we make food  too. My job in Gaza is to arrange everything for journalists who come to my homeland to tell the stories about what's going on in Gaza. Many mornings  I had to go to the border area to collect a journalist. If anything should happen to the journalist  or if the journalist decides to cover a story the government doesn't want us to cover  bad things could happen. Navigating through my country helping journalists  filmmakers  news crews  is my working life. I believe my success comes from building a relationship not only with journalists and the news crews  but also with the communities in the Gaza Strip. These communities who don't want their stories to be told  I never looked to them as stories or numbers. But like me  they are human beings. I have built up many relationships over    years. And guess what  This gives me the chance to get access to people  to stories that others can't. In some certain situations  I feel  as a woman  I have more power. Many male journalists in my society  they want to cover a story about drug addiction in my country. That problem started when the Gaza tunnel was being built. With the siege on Gaza  tunnels brought people all the basic needs like food  building material  other stuff we needed. But not anymore  because the Egyptian side flooded them up with water and they are not working anymore. Drugs were being smuggled  and many young people got addicted  too. In the tradition of the Palestinian society  it's forbidden for men to enter the household. So  no male journalists get the story. But I did. I have a wonderful husband  a wonderful husband who supports me despite all the criticism he gets from the society. He's at home now with my two kids  and I have another one that's growing in here. When I'm working  I call him every two hours  and he knows if he doesn't hear from me  he should call my contact  the one who gives me access to the story  which is the one who I trust. One of the times in Gaza  during the kidnapping of the British journalist Alan Johnston  I was asked by an American magazine to set up a meeting with the kidnappers in Gaza  and I did. The journalist covering the story and I were asked to meet outside of his hotel. They came  they picked us up in a black van with black windows  they were wearing masks on that day. And they drove us away  far away in the middle of a field. They took our cell phones and we did the interview with the kidnapper outside in that field. I was so scared that day  a day I will never forget. So  why do I do what I do  I do it because I believe if I didn't  a huge part of the story about Gaza will be missing. There are some more stories I could tell you about my country. And not all of them are bad. I love my country  despite the terrible situation we live in    siege  poverty  unemployment    but there is life. There are people who are dreamers and amazing people full of energy. We have wonderful music  and a great music school. We have parkour dancers who dance in the rubble of their homes. And Gaza is the only place in the Arab world where Muslims and Christians live in strong brotherhood. During the time of war  the hardest part for me is leaving the house early in the morning  leaving my children. I take a picture of them everyday because I never know if I will make it back to them. Being a fixer and a journalist is difficult and dangerous in Gaza. But when I hear the sound of the shelling or the sound of the bombing  I just head straight toward it  because I want to be there first  because these stories should be told. When my children were small and we heard the sound of the war  I used to tell them that they were fireworks. Now they are older  they understand. I do have terrible nightmares because of all that I witnessed during war times  especially these lifeless bodies of young children. I still remember a little girl  her name is Hala. She's the only survivor from her family. Her picture will be with me forever. I will never forget her. I'm proud that I can stand here and be here today with you. I'm proud that I can tell you stories  sad and happy  stories about my small corner of the world  Gaza. I'm proud that I am the first female fixer working in Gaza. And the funny thing is they call me Mr. Rambo in Gaza. I hope one day  I will get the chance to tell the stories of all other women  all other amazing women I know in my country. I hope that one day I can help other women in my country to be fixers like me. And of course sometimes  I feel I can't do this work anymore  it's just too much for me. But I remember these words   Don't limit your challenge  but challenge your limit. Don't allow others to stand in front of your dreams.  Thank you. Will we do whatever it takes to tackle climate change  I come at this question not as a green campaigner  in fact  I confess to be rather hopeless at recycling. I come at it as a professional observer of financial policy making and someone that wonders how history will judge us. One day  this ring that belonged to my grandfather will pass to my son  Charlie. And I wonder what his generation and perhaps the one that follows will make of the two lives this ring has worked. My grandfather was a coal miner. In his time  burning fossil fuels for energy and for allowing economies to develop was accepted. We know now that that is not the case because of the greenhouse gases that coal produces. But today  I fear it's the industry in which I work that will be judged more harshly because of its impact on the climate    more harshly than my grandfather's industry  even. I work  of course  in the banking industry  which will be remembered for its crisis in         a crisis that diverted the attention and finances of governments away from some really  really important promises  like promises made at the Copenhagen Climate Summit in      to mobilize     billion dollars a year to help developing countries move away from burning fossil fuels and transition to using cleaner energy. That promise is already in jeopardy. And that's a real problem  because that transition to cleaner energy needs to happen sooner rather than later. Firstly  because greenhouse gases  once released  stay in the atmosphere for decades. And secondly  if a developing economy builds its power grid around fossil fuels today  it's going to be way more costly to change later on. So for the climate  history may judge that the banking crisis happened at just the wrong time. The story need not be this gloomy  though. Three years ago  I argued that governments could use the tools deployed to save the financial system to meet other global challenges. And these arguments are getting stronger  not weaker  with time. Let's take a brief reminder of what those tools looked like. When the financial crisis hit in       the central banks of the US and UK began buying bonds issued by their own governments in a policy known as  quantitative easing.  Depending on what happens to those bonds when they mature  this is money printing by another name. And boy  did they print. The US alone created four trillion dollars' worth of its own currency. This was not done in isolation. In a remarkable act of cooperation  the     countries that make up the International Monetary Fund  the IMF  agreed to issue     billion dollars' worth of their own currency    the Special Drawing Right    to boost reserves around the world. When the financial crisis moved to Europe  the European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  promised  to do whatever it takes.  And they did. The Bank of Japan repeated those words    that exact same commitment    to do  whatever it takes  to reflate their economy. In both cases   whatever it takes  meant trillions of dollars more in money printing policies that continue today. What this shows is that when faced with some global challenges  policy makers are able to act collectively  with urgency  and run the risks of unconventional policies like money printing. So  let's go back to that original question  Can we print money for climate finance  Three years ago  the idea of using money in this way was something of a taboo. Once you break down and dismantle the idea that money is a finite resource  governments can quickly get overwhelmed by demands from their people to print more and more money for other causes  education  health care  welfare    even defense. And there are some truly terrible historical examples of money printing    uncontrolled money printing    leading to hyperinflation. Think  Weimar Republic in       Zimbabwe more recently  in       when the prices of basic goods like bread are doubling every day. But all of this is moving the public debate forward  so much so  that money printing for the people is now discussed openly in the financial media  and even in some political manifestos. But it's important the debate doesn't stop here  with printing national currencies. Because climate change is a shared global problem  there are some really compelling reasons why we should be printing that international currency that's issued by the IMF  to fund it. The Special Drawing Right  or SDR  is the IMF's electronic unit of account that governments use to transfer funds amongst each other. Think of it as a peer to peer payment network  like Bitcoin  but for governments. And it's truly global. Each of the     members of the IMF hold SDR quotas as part of their foreign exchange reserves. These are national stores of wealth that countries keep to protect themselves against currency crises. And that global nature is why  at the height of the financial crisis in       the IMF issued those extra     billion dollars    because it served as a collective global action that safeguarded countries large and small in one fell swoop. But here    here's the intriguing part. More than half of those extra SDRs that were printed in             billion dollars' worth    went to developed market countries who  for the most part  have a modest need for these foreign exchange reserves  because they have flexible exchange rates. So those extra reserves that were printed in       in the end  for developed market countries at least  weren't really needed. And they remain unused today. So here's an idea. As a first step  why don't we start spending those unused  those extra SDRs that were printed in       to combat climate change  They could  for example  be used to buy bonds issued by the UN's Green Climate Fund. This was a fund created in       following that climate agreement in Copenhagen. And it was designed to channel funds towards developing countries to meet their climate projects. It's been one of the most successful funds of its type  raising almost    billion dollars. But if we use those extra SDRs that were issued  it helps governments get back on track  to meet that promise of     billion dollars a year that was derailed by the financial crisis. It could also    it could also serve as a test case. If the inflationary consequences of using SDRs in this way are benign  it could be used to justify the additional  extra issuance of SDRs  say  every five years  again  with the commitment that developed market countries would direct their share of the new reserves to the Green Climate Fund. Printing international money in this way has several advantages over printing national currencies. The first is it's really easy to argue that spending money to mitigate climate change benefits everyone. No one section of society benefits from the printing press over another. That problem of competing claims is mitigated. It's also fair to say that because it takes so many countries to agree to issue these extra SDRs  it's highly unlikely that money printing would get out of control. What you end up with is a collective  global action aimed    and it's controlled global action    aimed at a global good. And  as we've learned with the money printing schemes  whatever concerns we have can be allayed by rules. So  for example  the issuance of these extra SDRs every five years could be capped  such that this international currency is never more than five percent of global foreign exchange reserves. That's important because it would allay well  let's say  the ridiculous concerns that the US might have that the SDR could ever challenge the dollar's dominant role in international finance. And in fact  I think the only thing that the SDR would likely steal from the dollar under this scheme is its nickname  the  greenback.  Because even with that cap in place  the IMF could have followed up its issuance    its massive issuance of SDRs in         with a further     billion dollars of SDRs in     . So hypothetically  that would mean that developed countries could have contributed up to     billion dollars' worth of SDRs to the Green Climate Fund. That's    times what it has today. And you know  as spectacular as that sounds  it's only just beginning to look like  whatever it takes.  And just to think what amazing things could be done with that money  consider this  in       Norway promised one billion dollars of its reserves to Brazil if they followed through on their goals on deforestation. That program has since delivered a    percent reduction in deforestation in the past decade. That's saving  .  billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions  which is the equivalent of taking all American cars off the roads for three whole years. So what could we do with     other pay for performance climate projects like that  organized on a global scale  We could take cars off the roads for a generation. So  let's not quibble about whether we can afford to fund climate change. The real question is  Do we care enough about future generations to take the very same policy risks we took to save the financial system  After all  we could do it  we did do it and we are doing it today. We must  must  must do  whatever it takes.  Thank you. For the next    minutes  I'm going to take you on a journey that is probably the biggest dream of humanity  to understand the code of life. So for me  everything started many  many years ago when I met the first  D printer. The concept was fascinating. A  D printer needs three elements  a bit of information  some raw material  some energy  and it can produce any object that was not there before. I was doing physics  I was coming back home and I realized that I actually always knew a  D printer. And everyone does. It was my mom. My mom takes three elements  a bit of information  which is between my father and my mom in this case  raw elements and energy in the same media  that is food  and after several months  produces me. And I was not existent before. So apart from the shock of my mom discovering that she was a  D printer  I immediately got mesmerized by that piece  the first one  the information. What amount of information does it take to build and assemble a human  Is it much  Is it little  How many thumb drives can you fill  Well  I was studying physics at the beginning and I took this approximation of a human as a gigantic Lego piece. So  imagine that the building blocks are little atoms and there is a hydrogen here  a carbon here  a nitrogen here. So in the first approximation  if I can list the number of atoms that compose a human being  I can build it. Now  you can run some numbers and that happens to be quite an astonishing number. So the number of atoms  the file that I will save in my thumb drive to assemble a little baby  will actually fill an entire Titanic of thumb drives    multiplied       times. This is the miracle of life. Every time you see from now on a pregnant lady  she's assembling the biggest amount of information that you will ever encounter. Forget big data  forget anything you heard of. This is the biggest amount of information that exists. But nature  fortunately  is much smarter than a young physicist  and in four billion years  managed to pack this information in a small crystal we call DNA. We met it for the first time in      when Rosalind Franklin  an amazing scientist  a woman  took a picture of it. But it took us more than    years to finally poke inside a human cell  take out this crystal  unroll it  and read it for the first time. The code comes out to be a fairly simple alphabet  four letters  A  T  C and G. And to build a human  you need three billion of them. Three billion. How many are three billion  It doesn't really make any sense as a number  right  So I was thinking how I could explain myself better about how big and enormous this code is. But there is    I mean  I'm going to have some help  and the best person to help me introduce the code is actually the first man to sequence it  Dr. Craig Venter. So welcome onstage  Dr. Craig Venter. Not the man in the flesh  but for the first time in history  this is the genome of a specific human  printed page by page  letter by letter          pages of information      kilograms  shipped from the United States to Canada thanks to Bruno Bowden  Lulu.com  a start up  did everything. It was an amazing feat. But this is the visual perception of what is the code of life. And now  for the first time  I can do something fun. I can actually poke inside it and read. So let me take an interesting book ... like this one. I have an annotation  it's a fairly big book. So just to let you see what is the code of life. Thousands and thousands and thousands and millions of letters. And they apparently make sense. Let's get to a specific part. Let me read it to you   AAG  AAT  ATA.  To you it sounds like mute letters  but this sequence gives the color of the eyes to Craig. I'll show you another part of the book. This is actually a little more complicated. Chromosome     book      As you might expect.  ATT  CTT  GATT.  This human is lucky  because if you miss just two letters in this position    two letters of our three billion    he will be condemned to a terrible disease  cystic fibrosis. We have no cure for it  we don't know how to solve it  and it's just two letters of difference from what we are. A wonderful book  a mighty book  a mighty book that helped me understand and show you something quite remarkable. Every one of you    what makes me  me and you  you    is just about five million of these  half a book. For the rest  we are all absolutely identical. Five hundred pages is the miracle of life that you are. The rest  we all share it. So think about that again when we think that we are different. This is the amount that we share. So now that I have your attention  the next question is  How do I read it  How do I make sense out of it  Well  for however good you can be at assembling Swedish furniture  this instruction manual is nothing you can crack in your life. And so  in       two famous TEDsters  Peter Diamandis and Craig Venter himself  decided to assemble a new company. Human Longevity was born  with one mission  trying everything we can try and learning everything we can learn from these books  with one target    making real the dream of personalized medicine  understanding what things should be done to have better health and what are the secrets in these books. An amazing team     data scientists and many  many more people  a pleasure to work with. The concept is actually very simple. We're going to use a technology called machine learning. On one side  we have genomes    thousands of them. On the other side  we collected the biggest database of human beings  phenotypes   D scan  NMR    everything you can think of. Inside there  on these two opposite sides  there is the secret of translation. And in the middle  we build a machine. We build a machine and we train a machine    well  not exactly one machine  many  many machines    to try to understand and translate the genome in a phenotype. What are those letters  and what do they do  It's an approach that can be used for everything  but using it in genomics is particularly complicated. Little by little we grew and we wanted to build different challenges. We started from the beginning  from common traits. Common traits are comfortable because they are common  everyone has them. So we started to ask our questions  Can we predict height  Can we read the books and predict your height  Well  we actually can  with five centimeters of precision. BMI is fairly connected to your lifestyle  but we still can  we get in the ballpark  eight kilograms of precision. Can we predict eye color  Yeah  we can. Eighty percent accuracy. Can we predict skin color  Yeah we can     percent accuracy. Can we predict age  We can  because apparently  the code changes during your life. It gets shorter  you lose pieces  it gets insertions. We read the signals  and we make a model. Now  an interesting challenge  Can we predict a human face  It's a little complicated  because a human face is scattered among millions of these letters. And a human face is not a very well defined object. So  we had to build an entire tier of it to learn and teach a machine what a face is  and embed and compress it. And if you're comfortable with machine learning  you understand what the challenge is here. Now  after    years       years after we read the first sequence    this October  we started to see some signals. And it was a very emotional moment. What you see here is a subject coming in our lab. This is a face for us. So we take the real face of a subject  we reduce the complexity  because not everything is in your face    lots of features and defects and asymmetries come from your life. We symmetrize the face  and we run our algorithm. The results that I show you right now  this is the prediction we have from the blood. Wait a second. In these seconds  your eyes are watching  left and right  left and right  and your brain wants those pictures to be identical. So I ask you to do another exercise  to be honest. Please search for the differences  which are many. The biggest amount of signal comes from gender  then there is age  BMI  the ethnicity component of a human. And scaling up over that signal is much more complicated. But what you see here  even in the differences  lets you understand that we are in the right ballpark  that we are getting closer. And it's already giving you some emotions. This is another subject that comes in place  and this is a prediction. A little smaller face  we didn't get the complete cranial structure  but still  it's in the ballpark. This is a subject that comes in our lab  and this is the prediction. So these people have never been seen in the training of the machine. These are the so called  held out  set. But these are people that you will probably never believe. We're publishing everything in a scientific publication  you can read it. But since we are onstage  Chris challenged me. I probably exposed myself and tried to predict someone that you might recognize. So  in this vial of blood    and believe me  you have no idea what we had to do to have this blood now  here    in this vial of blood is the amount of biological information that we need to do a full genome sequence. We just need this amount. We ran this sequence  and I'm going to do it with you. And we start to layer up all the understanding we have. In the vial of blood  we predicted he's a male. And the subject is a male. We predict that he's a meter and    cm. The subject is a meter and    cm. So  we predicted that he's     the subject is   . We predict his age    . The subject is   . We predict his eye color. Too dark. We predict his skin color. We are almost there. That's his face. Now  the reveal moment  the subject is this person. And I did it intentionally. I am a very particular and peculiar ethnicity. Southern European  Italians    they never fit in models. And it's particular    that ethnicity is a complex corner case for our model. But there is another point. So  one of the things that we use a lot to recognize people will never be written in the genome. It's our free will  it's how I look. Not my haircut in this case  but my beard cut. So I'm going to show you  I'm going to  in this case  transfer it    and this is nothing more than Photoshop  no modeling    the beard on the subject. And immediately  we get much  much better in the feeling. So  why do we do this  We certainly don't do it for predicting height or taking a beautiful picture out of your blood. We do it because the same technology and the same approach  the machine learning of this code  is helping us to understand how we work  how your body works  how your body ages  how disease generates in your body  how your cancer grows and develops  how drugs work and if they work on your body. This is a huge challenge. This is a challenge that we share with thousands of other researchers around the world. It's called personalized medicine. It's the ability to move from a statistical approach where you're a dot in the ocean  to a personalized approach  where we read all these books and we get an understanding of exactly how you are. But it is a particularly complicated challenge  because of all these books  as of today  we just know probably two percent  four books of more than    . And this is not the topic of my talk  because we will learn more. There are the best minds in the world on this topic. The prediction will get better  the model will get more precise. And the more we learn  the more we will be confronted with decisions that we never had to face before about life  about death  about parenting. So  we are touching the very inner detail on how life works. And it's a revolution that cannot be confined in the domain of science or technology. This must be a global conversation. We must start to think of the future we're building as a humanity. We need to interact with creatives  with artists  with philosophers  with politicians. Everyone is involved  because it's the future of our species. Without fear  but with the understanding that the decisions that we make in the next year will change the course of history forever. Thank you.
