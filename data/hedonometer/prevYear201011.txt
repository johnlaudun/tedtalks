I believe that there are new  hidden tensions that are actually happening between people and institutions    institutions that are the institutions that people inhabit in their daily life  schools  hospitals  workplaces  factories  offices  etc. And something that I see happening is something that I would like to call a sort of  democratization of intimacy.  And what do I mean by that  I mean that what people are doing is  in fact  they are sort of  with their communication channels  they are breaking an imposed isolation that these institutions are imposing on them. How are they doing this  They're doing it in a very simple way  by calling their mom from work  by IMing from their office to their friends  by texting under the desk. The pictures that you're seeing behind me are people that I visited in the last few months. And I asked them to come along with the person they communicate with most. And somebody brought a boyfriend  somebody a father. One young woman brought her grandfather. For    years  I've been looking at how people use channels such as email  the mobile phone  texting  etc. What we're actually going to see is that  fundamentally  people are communicating on a regular basis with five  six  seven of their most intimate sphere. Now  lets take some data. Facebook. Recently some sociologists from Facebook    Facebook is the channel that you would expect is the most enlargening of all channels. And an average user  said Cameron Marlow  from Facebook  has about     friends. But he actually talks to  has two way exchanges with  about four to six people on a regular base  depending on his gender. Academic research on instant messaging also shows     people on buddy lists  but fundamentally people chat with two  three  four    anyway  less than five. My own research on cellphones and voice calls shows that    percent of the calls are actually made to four people.    percent. And when you go to Skype  it's down to two people. A lot of sociologists actually are quite disappointed. I mean  I've been a bit disappointed sometimes when I saw this data and all this deployment  just for five people. And some sociologists actually feel that it's a closure  it's a cocooning  that we're disengaging from the public. And I would actually  I would like to show you that if we actually look at who is doing it  and from where they're doing it  actually there is an incredible social transformation. There are three stories that I think are quite good examples. The first gentleman  he's a baker. And so he starts working every morning at four o'clock in the morning. And around eight o'clock he sort of sneaks away from his oven  cleans his hands from the flour and calls his wife. He just wants to wish her a good day  because that's the start of her day. And I've heard this story a number of times. A young factory worker who works night shifts  who manages to sneak away from the factory floor  where there is CCTV by the way  and find a corner  where at    o'clock at night he can call his girlfriend and just say goodnight. Or a mother who  at four o'clock  suddenly manages to find a corner in the toilet to check that her children are safely home. Then there is another couple  there is a Brazilian couple. They've lived in Italy for a number of years. They Skype with their families a few times a week. But once a fortnight  they actually put the computer on their dining table  pull out the webcam and actually have dinner with their family in Sao Paulo. And they have a big event of it. And I heard this story the first time a couple of years ago from a very modest family of immigrants from Kosovo in Switzerland. They had set up a big screen in their living room  and every morning they had breakfast with their grandmother. But Danny Miller  who is a very good anthropologist who is working on Filipina migrant women who leave their children back in the Philippines  was telling me about how much parenting is going on through Skype  and how much these mothers are engaged with their children through Skype. And then there is the third couple. They are two friends. They chat to each other every day  a few times a day actually. And finally  finally  they've managed to put instant messaging on their computers at work. And now  obviously  they have it open. Whenever they have a moment they chat to each other. And this is exactly what we've been seeing with teenagers and kids doing it in school  under the table  and texting under the table to their friends. So  none of these cases are unique. I mean  I could tell you hundreds of them. But what is really exceptional is the setting. So  think of the three settings I've talked to you about  factory  migration  office. But it could be in a school  it could be an administration  it could be a hospital. Three settings that  if we just step back    years  if you just think back    years  when you clocked in  when you clocked in to an office  when you clocked in to a factory  there was no contact for the whole duration of the time  there was no contact with your private sphere. If you were lucky there was a public phone hanging in the corridor or somewhere. If you were in management  oh  that was a different story. Maybe you had a direct line. If you were not  you maybe had to go through an operator. But basically  when you walked into those buildings  the private sphere was left behind you. And this has become such a norm of our professional lives  such a norm and such an expectation. And it had nothing to do with technical capability. The phones were there. But the expectation was once you moved in there your commitment was fully to the task at hand  fully to the people around you. That was where the focus had to be. And this has become such a cultural norm that we actually school our children for them to be capable to do this cleavage. If you think nursery  kindergarten  first years of school are just dedicated to take away the children  to make them used to staying long hours away from their family. And then the school enacts perfectly well. It mimics perfectly all the rituals that we will find in offices  rituals of entry  rituals of exit  the schedules  the uniforms in this country  things that identify you  team building activities  team building that will allow you to basically be with a random group of kids  or a random group of people that you will have to be with for a number of time. And of course  the major thing  learn to pay attention  to concentrate and focus your attention. This only started about     years ago. It only started with the birth of modern bureaucracy  and of industrial revolution. When people basically had to go somewhere else to work and carry out the work. And when with modern bureaucracy there was a very rational approach  where there was a clear distinction between the private sphere and the public sphere. So  until then  basically people were living on top of their trades. They were living on top of the land they were laboring. They were living on top of the workshops where they were working. And if you think  it's permeated our whole culture  even our cities. If you think of medieval cities  medieval cities the boroughs all have the names of the guilds and professions that lived there. Now we have sprawling residential suburbias that are well distinct from production areas and commercial areas. And actually  over these     years  there has been a very clear class system that also has emerged. So the lower the status of the job and of the person carrying out  the more removed he would be from his personal sphere. People have taken this amazing possibility of actually being in contact all through the day or in all types of situations. And they are doing it massively. The Pew Institute  which produces good data on a regular basis on  for instance  in the States  says that    and I think that this number is conservative       percent of anybody with email access at work is actually doing private email from his office. I really think that the number is conservative. In my own research  we saw that the peak for private email is actually    o'clock in the morning  whatever the country.    percent of people admit doing private conversations from work on their mobile phones.     percent are using text. The point is that this re appropriation of the personal sphere is not terribly successful with all institutions. I'm always surprised the U.S. Army sociologists are discussing of the impact for instance  of soldiers in Iraq having daily contact with their families. But there are many institutions that are actually blocking this access. And every day  every single day  I read news that makes me cringe  like a     fine to kids in Texas  for using  every time they take out their mobile phone in school. Immediate dismissal to bus drivers in New York  if seen with a mobile phone in a hand. Companies blocking access to IM or to Facebook. Behind issues of security and safety  which have always been the arguments for social control  in fact what is going on is that these institutions are trying to decide who  in fact  has a right to self determine their attention  to decide  whether they should  or not  be isolated. And they are actually trying to block  in a certain sense  this movement of a greater possibility of intimacy. A few years ago  my eyes were opened to the dark side of the construction industry. In       young Qatari students took me to go and see the migrant worker camps. And since then I've followed the unfolding issue of worker rights. In the last six months  more than     skyscrapers in the UAE have been put on hold or canceled. Behind the headlines that lay behind these buildings is the fate of the often indentured construction worker.  .  million of them. Mainly Indian  Pakistani  Sri Lankan and Nepalese  these laborers risk everything to make money for their families back home. They pay a middle man thousands of dollars to be there. And when they arrive  they find themselves in labor camps with no water  no air conditioning  and their passports taken away. While it's easy to point the finger at local officials and higher authorities     percent of these people are hired by the private sector  and so therefore we're equally  if not more  accountable. Groups like Buildsafe UAE have emerged  but the numbers are simply overwhelming. In August       UAE public officials noted that    percent of the country's       labor camps had violated minimum health and fire safety regulations. And last summer  more than        workers protested for the non payment of wages  for the poor quality of food  and inadequate housing. And then the financial collapse happened. When the contractors have gone bust  as they've been overleveraged like everyone else  the difference is everything goes missing  documentation  passports  and tickets home for these workers. Currently  right now  thousands of workers are abandoned. There is no way back home. And there is no way  and no proof of arrival. These are the boom and bust refugees. The question is  as a building professional  as an architect  an engineer  as a developer  if you know this is going on  as we go to the sights every single week  are you complacent or complicit in the human rights violations  So let's forget your environmental footprint. Let's think about your ethical footprint. What good is it to build a zero carbon  energy efficient complex  when the labor producing this architectural gem is unethical at best  Now  recently I've been told I've been taking the high road. But  quite frankly  on this issue  there is no other road. So let's not forget who is really paying the price of this financial collapse. And that as we worry about our next job in the office  the next design that we can get  to keep our workers. Let's not forget these men  who are truly dying to work. Thank you. I'd like to talk to you today about the scale of the scientific effort that goes into making the headlines you see in the paper. Headlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change  and headlines that look like this when they have to do with air quality or smog. They are both two branches of the same field of atmospheric science. Recently the headlines looked like this when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  or IPCC  put out their report on the state of understanding of the atmospheric system. That report was written by     scientists from    countries. They wrote almost a thousand pages on the topic. And all of those pages were reviewed by another     plus scientists and reviewers  from     countries. It's a big community. It's such a big community  in fact  that our annual gathering is the largest scientific meeting in the world. Over        scientists go to San Francisco every year for that. And every one of those scientists is in a research group  and every research group studies a wide variety of topics. For us at Cambridge  it's as varied as the El Ni o oscillation  which affects weather and climate  to the assimilation of satellite data  to emissions from crops that produce biofuels  which is what I happen to study. And in each one of these research areas  of which there are even more  there are PhD students  like me  and we study incredibly narrow topics  things as narrow as a few processes or a few molecules. And one of the molecules I study is called isoprene  which is here. It's a small organic molecule. You've probably never heard of it. The weight of a paper clip is approximately equal to     zeta illion       to the   st    molecules of isoprene. But despite its very small weight  enough of it is emitted into the atmosphere every year to equal the weight of all the people on the planet. It's a huge amount of stuff. It's equal to the weight of methane. And because it's so much stuff  it's really important for the atmospheric system. Because it's important to the atmospheric system  we go to all lengths to study this thing. We blow it up and look at the pieces. This is the EUPHORE Smog Chamber in Spain. Atmospheric explosions  or full combustion  takes about        times longer than what happens in your car. But still  we look at the pieces. We run enormous models on supercomputers  this is what I happen to do. Our models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes calculating hundreds of variables each  on minute timescales. And it takes weeks to perform our integrations. And we perform dozens of integrations in order to understand what's happening. We also fly all over the world looking for this thing. I recently joined a field campaign in Malaysia. There are others. We found a global atmospheric watchtower there  in the middle of the rainforest  and hung hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of scientific equipment off this tower  to look for isoprene  and of course  other things while we were there. This is the tower in the middle of the rainforest  from above. And this is the tower from below. And on part of that field campaign we even brought an aircraft with us. And this plane  the model  BA     which was run by FAAM  normally flies     to     people. So maybe you took a similar aircraft to get here today. But we didn't just fly it. We were flying at     meters above the top of the canopy to measure this molecule    incredibly dangerous stuff. We have to fly at a special incline in order to make the measurements. We hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering. We have to get special flight clearance. And as you come around the banks in these valleys  the forces can get up to two Gs. And the scientists have to be completely harnessed in in order to make measurements while they're on board. So  as you can imagine  the inside of this aircraft doesn't look like any plane you would take on vacation. It's a flying laboratory that we took to make measurements in the region of this molecule. We do all of this to understand the chemistry of one molecule. And when one student like me has some sort of inclination or understanding about that molecule  they write one scientific paper on the subject. And out of that field campaign we'll probably get a few dozen papers on a few dozen processes or molecules. And as a body of knowledge builds up  it will form one subsection  or one sub subsection of an assessment like the IPCC  although we have others. And each one of the    chapters of the IPCC has six to ten subsections. So you can imagine the scale of the effort. In each one of those assessments that we write  we always tag on a summary  and the summary is written for a non scientific audience. And we hand that summary to journalists and policy makers  in order to make headlines like these. Thank you very much. I started my journey    years ago. And I worked in mines. And I realized that this was a world unseen. And I wanted  through color and large format cameras and very large prints  to make a body of work that somehow became symbols of our use of the landscape  how we use the land. And to me this was a key component that somehow  through this medium of photography  which allows us to contemplate these landscapes  that I thought photography was perfectly suited to doing this type of work. And after    years of photographing large industrial landscapes  it occurred to me that oil is underpinning the scale and speed. Because that is what has changed  is the speed at which we're taking all our resources. And so then I went out to develop a whole series on the landscape of oil. And what I want to do is to kind of map an arc that there is extraction  where we're taking it from the ground  refinement. And that's one chapter. The other chapter that I wanted to look at was how we use it    our cities  our cars  our motorcultures  where people gather around the vehicle as a celebration. And then the third one is this idea of the end of oil  this entropic end  where all of our parts of cars  our tires  oil filters  helicopters  planes    where are the landscapes where all of that stuff ends up  And to me  again  photography was a way in which I could explore and research the world  and find those places. And another idea that I had as well  that was brought forward by an ecologist    he basically did a calculation where he took one liter of gas and said  well  how much carbon it would take  and how much organic material  It was    metric tons for one liter. So whenever I fill up my gas  I think of that liter  and how much carbon. And I know that oil comes from the ocean and phytoplankton  but he did the calculations for our Earth and what it had to do to produce that amount of energy. From the photosynthetic growth  it would take     years of that growth to produce what we use  the    billion barrels we use per year. And that also brought me to the fact that this poses such a risk to our society. Looking at    billion per year  we look at our two largest suppliers  Saudi Arabia and now Canada  with its dirty oil. And together they only form about    years of supply. The whole world  at  .  trillion estimated reserves  only gives us about    years. So  it's not a question of if  but a question of when peak oil will come upon us. So  to me  using photography    and I feel that all of us need to now begin to really take the task of using our talents  our ways of thinking  to begin to deal with what I think is probably one of the most challenging issues of our time  how to deal with our energy crisis. And I would like to say that  on the other side of it         years from now  the children that I have  I can look at them and say   We did everything we possibly  humanly could do  to begin to mitigate this  what I feel is one of the most important and critical moments in our time. Thank you. I'd like to ask you  what do these three people have in common  Well  you probably recognize the first person. I'm sure you're all avid  American Idol  watchers. But you might not recognize Aydah Al Jahani  who is a contestant  indeed a finalist  in the Poet of the Millions competition  which is broadcast out of Abu Dhabi  and seen throughout the Arab world. In this contest people have to write and recite original poetry  in the Nabati form of poetry  which is the traditional Bedouin form. And Lima Sahar was a finalist in the Afghan Star singing competition. Now  before I go any further  yes  I know it all began with  Britain's Got Talent.  But my point in discussing this is to show you    I hope I'll be able to show you how these merit based competitions  with equal access to everyone  with the winner selected via voting by SMS  are changing tribal societies. And I'm going to focus on Afghanistan and the Arab world with the UAE  how they're changing tribal societies  not by introducing Western ideas  but by being integrated into the language in those places. It all begins with enjoyment. Video  We are late to watch  Afghan Star.  We are going to watch  Afghan Star.  We are late. We are running late. We must go to watch  Afghan Star.  Cynthia Schneider  These programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society. In Afghanistan  people go to extraordinary lengths to be able to watch this program. And you don't necessarily have to have your own TV set. People watch it all over the country also in public places. But it goes beyond watching  because also  part of this is campaigning. People become so engaged that they have volunteers  just like political volunteers anyway  who fan out over the countryside  campaigning for their candidate. Contestants also put themselves forward. Now  of course there is a certain degree of ethnic allegiance  but not entirely. Because each year the winner has come from a different tribal group. This has opened up the door  particularly for women. And in the last season there were two women in the finalists. One of them  Lima Sahar  is a Pashtun from Kandahar  a very conservative part of the country. And here she relates  in the documentary film  Afghan Star   how her friends urged her not to do this and told her that she was leaving them for democracy. But she also confides that she knows that members of the Taliban are actually SMS ing votes in for her. Aydah Al Jahnani also took risks and put herself out  to compete in the Poet of the Millions competition. I have to say  her husband backed her from the start. But her tribe and family urged her not to compete and were very much against it. But  once she started to win  then they got behind her again. It turns out that competition and winning is a universal human value. And she's out there. Her poetry is about women  and the life of women in society. So just by presenting herself and being in competition with men    this shows the voting on the program    it sets a very important example for young women    these are young women in the audience of the program    in Abu Dhabi  but also people in the viewing audience. Now you'd think that  American Idol  would introduce a measure of Americanization. But actually  just the opposite is happening. By using this engaging popular format for traditional  local culture  it actually  in the Gulf  is precipitating a revival of interest in Nabati poetry  also in traditional dress and dance and music. And for Afghanistan  where the Taliban banned music for many years  it is reintroducing their traditional music. They don't sing pop songs  they sing Afghan music. And they also have learned how to lose gracefully  without avenging the winner. No small thing. And the final  sort of  formulation of this  American Idol  format  which has just appeared in Afghanistan  is a new program called  The Candidate.  And in this program  people present policy platforms that are then voted on. Many of them are too young to run for president  but by putting the issues out there  they are influencing the presidential race. So for me  the substance of things unseen is how reality TV is driving reality. Thank you. We grew up interacting with the physical objects around us. There are an enormous number of them that we use every day. Unlike most of our computing devices  these objects are much more fun to use. When you talk about objects  one other thing automatically comes attached to that thing  and that is gestures  how we manipulate these objects  how we use these objects in everyday life. We use gestures not only to interact with these objects  but we also use them to interact with each other. A gesture of  Namaste    maybe  to respect someone  or maybe  in India I don't need to teach a kid that this means  four runs  in cricket. It comes as a part of our everyday learning. So  I am very interested  from the beginning  how our knowledge about everyday objects and gestures  and how we use these objects  can be leveraged to our interactions with the digital world. Rather than using a keyboard and mouse  why can I not use my computer in the same way that I interact in the physical world  So  I started this exploration around eight years back  and it literally started with a mouse on my desk. Rather than using it for my computer  I actually opened it. Most of you might be aware that  in those days  the mouse used to come with a ball inside  and there were two rollers that actually guide the computer where the ball is moving  and  accordingly  where the mouse is moving. So  I was interested in these two rollers  and I actually wanted more  so I borrowed another mouse from a friend    never returned to him    and I now had four rollers. Interestingly  what I did with these rollers is  basically  I took them off of these mouses and then put them in one line. It had some strings and pulleys and some springs. What I got is basically a gesture interface device that actually acts as a motion sensing device made for two dollars. So  here  whatever movement I do in my physical world is actually replicated inside the digital world just using this small device that I made  around eight years back  in     . Because I was interested in integrating these two worlds  I thought of sticky notes. I thought   Why can I not connect the normal interface of a physical sticky note to the digital world   A message written on a sticky note to my mom  on paper  can come to an SMS  or maybe a meeting reminder automatically syncs with my digital calendar    a to do list that automatically syncs with you. But you can also search in the digital world  or maybe you can write a query  saying   What is Dr. Smith's address   and this small system actually prints it out    so it actually acts like a paper input output system  just made out of paper. In another exploration  I thought of making a pen that can draw in three dimensions. So  I implemented this pen that can help designers and architects not only think in three dimensions  but they can actually draw  so that it's more intuitive to use that way. Then I thought   Why not make a Google Map  but in the physical world   Rather than typing a keyword to find something  I put my objects on top of it. If I put a boarding pass  it will show me where the flight gate is. A coffee cup will show where you can find more coffee  or where you can trash the cup. So  these were some of the earlier explorations I did because the goal was to connect these two worlds seamlessly. Among all these experiments  there was one thing in common  I was trying to bring a part of the physical world to the digital world. I was taking some part of the objects  or any of the intuitiveness of real life  and bringing them to the digital world  because the goal was to make our computing interfaces more intuitive. But then I realized that we humans are not actually interested in computing. What we are interested in is information. We want to know about things. We want to know about dynamic things going around. So I thought  around last year    in the beginning of the last year    I started thinking   Why can I not take this approach in the reverse way   Maybe   How about I take my digital world and paint the physical world with that digital information   Because pixels are actually  right now  confined in these rectangular devices that fit in our pockets. Why can I not remove this confine and take that to my everyday objects  everyday life so that I don't need to learn the new language for interacting with those pixels  So  in order to realize this dream  I actually thought of putting a big size projector on my head. I think that's why this is called a head mounted projector  isn't it  I took it very literally  and took my bike helmet  put a little cut over there so that the projector actually fits nicely. So now  what I can do    I can augment the world around me with this digital information. But later  I realized that I actually wanted to interact with those digital pixels  also. So I put a small camera over there that acts as a digital eye. Later  we moved to a much better  consumer oriented pendant version of that  that many of you now know as the SixthSense device. But the most interesting thing about this particular technology is that you can carry your digital world with you wherever you go. You can start using any surface  any wall around you  as an interface. The camera is actually tracking all your gestures. Whatever you're doing with your hands  it's understanding that gesture. And  actually  if you see  there are some color markers that in the beginning version we are using with it. You can start painting on any wall. You stop by a wall  and start painting on that wall. But we are not only tracking one finger  here. We are giving you the freedom of using all of both of your hands  so you can actually use both of your hands to zoom into or zoom out of a map just by pinching all present. The camera is actually doing    just  getting all the images    is doing the edge recognition and also the color recognition and so many other small algorithms are going on inside. So  technically  it's a little bit complex  but it gives you an output which is more intuitive to use  in some sense. But I'm more excited that you can actually take it outside. Rather than getting your camera out of your pocket  you can just do the gesture of taking a photo  and it takes a photo for you. Thank you. And later I can find a wall  anywhere  and start browsing those photos or maybe   OK  I want to modify this photo a little bit and send it as an email to a friend.  So  we are looking for an era where computing will actually merge with the physical world. And  of course  if you don't have any surface  you can start using your palm for simple operations. Here  I'm dialing a phone number just using my hand. The camera is actually not only understanding your hand movements  but  interestingly  is also able to understand what objects you are holding in your hand. For example  in this case  the book cover is matched with so many thousands  or maybe millions of books online  and checking out which book it is. Once it has that information  it finds out more reviews about that  or maybe New York Times has a sound overview on that  so you can actually hear  on a physical book  a review as sound. This was Obama's visit last week to MIT. Pranav Mistry  So  I was seeing the live  video  of his talk  outside  on just a newspaper. Your newspaper will show you live weather information rather than having it updated. You have to check your computer in order to do that  right  When I'm going back  I can just use my boarding pass to check how much my flight has been delayed  because at that particular time  I'm not feeling like opening my iPhone  and checking out a particular icon. And I think this technology will not only change the way    Yes. It will change the way we interact with people  also  not only the physical world. The fun part is  I'm going to the Boston metro  and playing a pong game inside the train on the ground  right  And I think the imagination is the only limit of what you can think of when this kind of technology merges with real life. But many of you argue  actually  that all of our work is not only about physical objects. We actually do lots of accounting and paper editing and all those kinds of things  what about that  And many of you are excited about the next generation tablet computers to come out in the market. So  rather than waiting for that  I actually made my own  just using a piece of paper. So  what I did here is remove the camera    All the webcam cameras have a microphone inside the camera. I removed the microphone from that  and then just pinched that    like I just made a clip out of the microphone    and clipped that to a piece of paper  any paper that you found around. So now the sound of the touch is getting me when exactly I'm touching the paper. But the camera is actually tracking where my fingers are moving. You can of course watch movies. and I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe   .  PM  And you can of course play games. Here  the camera is actually understanding how you're holding the paper and playing a car racing game. Many of you already must have thought  OK  you can browse. Yeah. Of course you can browse to any websites or you can do all sorts of computing on a piece of paper wherever you need it. So  more interestingly  I'm interested in how we can take that in a more dynamic way. When I come back to my desk  I can just pinch that information back to my desktop so I can use my full size computer. And why only computers  We can just play with papers. Paper world is interesting to play with. Here  I'm taking a part of a document  and putting over here a second part from a second place  and I'm actually modifying the information that I have over there. Yeah. And I say   OK  this looks nice  let me print it out  that thing.  So I now have a print out of that thing. So the workflow is more intuitive  the way we used to do it maybe    years back  rather than now switching between these two worlds. So  as a last thought  I think that integrating information to everyday objects will not only help us to get rid of the digital divide  the gap between these two worlds  but will also help us  in some way  to stay human  to be more connected to our physical world. And it will actually help us not end up being machines sitting in front of other machines. That's all. Thank you. Thank you. Chris Anderson  So  Pranav  first of all  you're a genius. This is incredible  really. What are you doing with this  Is there a company being planned  Or is this research forever  or what  Pranav Mistry  So  there are lots of companies  sponsor companies of Media Lab interested in taking this ahead in one or another way. Companies like mobile phone operators want to take this in a different way than the NGOs in India  thinking   Why can we only have 'Sixth Sense'  We should have a 'Fifth Sense' for missing sense people who cannot speak. This technology can be used for them to speak out in a different way maybe a speaker system.  CA  What are your own plans  Are you staying at MIT  or are you going to do something with this  PM  I'm trying to make this more available to people so that anyone can develop their own SixthSense device  because the hardware is actually not that hard to manufacture or hard to make your own. We will provide all the open source software for them  maybe starting next month. CA  Open source  Wow. CA  Are you going to come back to India with some of this  at some point  PM  Yeah. Yes  yes  of course. CA  What are your plans  MIT  India  How are you going to split your time going forward  PM  There is a lot of energy here. Lots of learning. All of this work that you have seen is all about my learning in India. And now  if you see  it's more about the cost effectiveness  this system costs you      compared to the         surface tables  or anything like that. Or maybe even the    mouse gesture system at that time was costing around         I showed that  at a conference  to President Abdul Kalam  at that time  and then he said   OK  we should use this in Bhabha Atomic Research Centre for some use of that.  So I'm excited about how I can bring the technology to the masses rather than just keeping that technology in the lab environment. CA  Based on the people we've seen at TED  I would say you're truly one of the two or three best inventors in the world right now. It's an honor to have you at TED. Thank you so much. That's fantastic. One morning  in the year       the neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield saw himself like this  a weird freak with huge hands  huge mouth  and a tiny bottom. Actually this creature is the result of the Penfield research. He named it homunculus. Basically the homunculus is the visualization of a human being where each part of the body is proportional to the surface it takes in the brain. So  of course  homunculus is definitely not a freak. It's you. It's me. It's our invisible reality. This visualization could explain  for example  why newborns  or smokers  put  instinctively  their fingers in the mouth. Unfortunately it doesn't explain why so many designers remain mainly interested in designing chairs. So anyway  even if I do not understand science entirely  for my design I essentially refer to it. I'm fascinated by its ability to deeply investigate the human being  its way of working  its way of feeling. And it really helps me to understand how we see  how we hear  how we breathe  how our brain can inform or mislead us. It's a great tool for me to understand what could be our real needs. Marketing people have never been able to do that. Marketing reduces things. Marketing simplifies. Marketing creates user groups. And scientists  amidst complexity  amidst fluctuation and uniqueness. What could be our real needs  Maybe the silence. In our daily life we are continuously disturbed by aggressive sounds. And you know all those kind of sound puts us in a kind of stressful state  and prevent us from being quiet and focused. So I wanted to create a kind of sound filter  able to preserve ourselves from noise pollution. But I didn't want it to make it by isolating people  without any earmuffs or those kind of things. Or neither with including complex technology. I just wanted to  using the complexity and the technology of the brain  of the human brain. So I worked with white noise. dB is basically    dB is the name of the product  basically a white noise diffuser. This is white noise. The white noise is the sum of all frequencies that are audible by the human being  brought to the same intensity. And this noise is like a  shhhhhhhhhhhhh   like that. And this noise is the most neutral. It is the perfect sound for our ears and our brain. So when you hear this sound you feel like a kind of shelter  preserved from noise pollution. And when you hear the white noise  your brain is immediately focused on it. And do not be disturbed any more by the other aggressive sound. It seems to be magic. But it is just physiology. It's just in your brain. And in mine  I hope. So in order to make this white noise a little bit active and reactive  I create a ball  a rolling ball able to analyze and find where does aggressive sound come from  and roll  at home or at work  towards aggressive noise  and emits white noise in order to neutralize it. It works. You feel the effect of the white noise  It's too in silence. If you make some noise you can feel the effect. So even if this object  even if this product includes some technology  it includes some speakers  it includes some microphones and some electronic devices  this object is not a very smart object. And I don't want to make a very smart object. I don't want to create a perfect object like a perfect robot. I want to create an object like you and me. So  definitely not perfect. So imagine  for instance  you are at home. A loving dispute with your girl or boyfriend. You shout. You say   Blah blah blah  Blah blah blah. Who is this guy   And dB will probably roll toward you. And turning around you is  shhhhhhh   like that. Definitely not perfect. So you would probably shut it  at this point. Anyway  in this same kind of approach  I designed K. K is a daylight receiver transmitter. So this object is supposed to be displayed on your desk  or on your piano  where you are supposed to spend most of your time in the day. And this object will be able to know exactly the quantity of light you receive during the day  and able to give you the quantity of light you need. This object is completely covered by fiber opticals. And the idea of those fiber opticals is to inform the object  for sure  but creates the idea of an eye sensibility of the object. I want  by this design feel  when you see it  you see  instinctively  this object seems to be very sensitive  very reactive. And this object knows  better than you and probably before you  what you really need. You have to know that the lack of daylight can provoke some problem of energy  or problem of libido. So  a huge problem. Most of the projects I work on    I live in collaboration with scientists. I'm just a designer. So I need them. So there can be some biologists  psychiatrists  mathematicians  and so on. And I submit them  my intuitions  my hypothesis  my first ideas. And they react. They told me what is possible  what is impossible. And together we improve the original concept. And we build the project to the end. And this kind of relationship between designer and scientist started when I was at school. Indeed in my studies I was a guinea pig for a pharmaceutical industry. And the irony for me was of course  I didn't do that for the sake of science progress. I just do that to make money. Anyway  this project  or this experience  make me start a new project on the design of medicine. You have to know that today  roughly one or two every drug pills is not taken correctly. So even if the active constituents in pharmaceuticals made constant progress in terms of chemistry  target of stability  the behavior of the patients goes more and more unstable. So we took too many of them. We took irregular dosage. We do not follow instructions. And so on. So I wanted to create a new kind of medicine  in order to create a new kind of relationship between the patient and the treatment. So I turned traditional pills into this. I'm going to give you some example. This one is an antibiotic. And its purpose is to help patient to go to the end of the treatment. And the concept is to create a kind of onion  a kind of structure in layers. So  you start with the darkest one. And you are helped to visualize the duration of the treatment. And you are helped to visualize the decrease of the infection. So the first day  this is the big one. And you have to peel and eat one layer a day. And your antibiotic goes smaller and clearer. And you're waiting for recovery as you were waiting for the Christmas day. And you follow the treatment like that  to the end of the treatment. And here you can get the white core. And it means  right  you are in the recovery. This one is a  third lung   a pharmaceutical device for long term asthma treatment. I designed it to help kids to follow the treatment. So the idea of this one is to create a relationship between the patient of the treatment but a relationship of dependency. But in this case it is not the medication that is dependent on the patient. This is  the kids will feel the therapeutic object needs him. So the idea is  all night long the elastic skin of the third lung will slowly inflate itself  including air and molecules  for sure. And when the kids wake up  he can see the object needs him. And he take him to his mouth  and breathe the air it contains. So by this way  the kid  to take care of himself  is to take care of this living object. And he does not feel anymore it's relies on asthma treatment  as the asthma treatment needs him. In this guise of living object approach  I like the idea of a kind of invisible design  as if the function of the object exists in a kind of invisible field just around the objects themselves. We could talk about a kind of soul  of a ghost accompanying them. And almost a kind of poltergeist effect. So when a passive object like this one seems to be alive  because it is    woosh    starting to move. And I remember an exhibition design I made for John Maeda  and for the Fondation Cartier in Paris. And John Maeda was supposed to show several graphic animations in this exhibition. And my idea for this exhibition design was to create a real pong game  like this one. And the idea was to create some self moving benches in the main exhibition room. So the living benches would be exactly like the ball. And John was so excited by this idea. He said to me   Okay let's go.  I remember the day of the opening. I was a little bit late. When I bring the    living and self moving benches in the exhibition room  John was just beside me  and was like   Hmm. Hmm.  And he told me  after a long silence   I wonder  Mathieu  if people won't be more fascinated by your benches than by my videos.  It would be a great honor  a great compliment for me  if he hadn't decided to take all them off two hours before the opening. So  huge tragedy. I guess you won't be surprised if I tell you that Pinocchio is one of my great influences. Pinocchio is probably one of my best design products  my favorite one. Because it is a kind of object with a conscience  able to be modified by its surroundings  and able to modify it as well. The other great influence is the mine's canary. In coal mines  this canary was supposed to be close to the miners. And it was singing all day long. And when it stops it means that it just died. So this canary was a living alarm  and a very efficient one. A very natural technology  in order to say to the miners   The air is too bad. You have to go. It's an emergency.  So it's  for me  a great product. And I tried to design a kind of canary. Andrea is one. Andrea is a living air filter that absorbs toxic gasses from air  contaminated indoor air. So it uses some plants to do this job  selected for their gas filtering ability. You have to know  or you probably already know  that indoor air pollution is more toxic than outdoor one. So while I'm talking to you  the seats you are sitting on are currently emitting some invisible and odorless toxic gas. Sorry for that.  Laughter  So you are currently breathing formaldehyde. It's the same for me with the carpet. And this is exactly the same at home. Because all the product we get constantly give away the volatile component of which they're made of. So let's have a look at your home. So your sofa  your plastic chair  your kid's toys give their own invisible reality. And this one is very toxic. This is the reason why I created  with David Edward  a scientist of Harvard University  an object able to absorb the toxic elements using those kind of plants. But the idea is to force the air to go in the effective part of the plants. Because the roots of the plant are not very effective. Bill Wolverton from NASA analyzed it cleverly in the '  s. So the idea is to create an object able to force the air  and to be in contact at the right speed at the right place  in all the effective parts of the plant. So this is the final object. It will be launched next September. This one is kind of the same approach because I include  in a product like Andrea  some plants. And in this one  plants are used for the water filtration ability. And it includes some fishes as well. But here  unlike Andrea  here are supposed to be eaten. Indeed  this object is a domestic farm  for fishes and green. So the idea of this object is to be able to get at home very local food. The locavores used to get food taken in a radius of     miles. Local River is able to provide you food directly in your living room. So the principle of this object is to create an ecosystem called aquaponics. And the aquaponics is the dirty water of the fish  by a water pump  feeds the plants above. And the plants will filter  by the roots  the dirty water of the fish. After  it goes back into the fish tank. After that you have two options. Or you sit down in front of it like you would do in front your TV set. Amazing channel. Or you start fishing. And you make some sushis with a fish and the aromatic plants above. Because you can grow some potatoes. No  not potatoes  but tomatoes  aromatic plants and so on. So now we can breathe safely. Now we can eat local food. Now we can be treated by smart medicine. Now we can be well balanced in our biorhythm with daylight. But it was important to create a perfect place  so I tried to  in order to work and create. So I designed  for an American scientist based in Paris  a very stimulative  brain stimulative office. I wanted to create a perfect place where you can work and play  and where your body and your brain can work together. So  in this office  you do not work anymore at your desk  like a politician. Your seat  your sleep and your play on a big geodesic island made of leather. See  like this one  In this office you do not work and write and draw on a sheet of paper  but you draw directly on a kind of huge whiteboard cave  like a prehistoric scientist. So you  like that  can make some sport during your work. In this office you do not need to go out in order to be in contact with nature. You include  directly  the nature in the floor of the office. You can see it there. This is an inspiration image to lead this project of the office. It really helped me to design it. I never show it to my client. He would be so afraid. Just for my workshop. I guess it may be the revenge of the guinea pig I was. But it's maybe the conviction as monkey and homunculus we are. All of us need to be considered according to our real nature. Thank you very much. I'm going to talk about some of my discoveries around the world through my work. These are not discoveries of planets or new technologies or science. They're discoveries of people and the way people are  and new leadership. This is Benki. Benki is a leader of the Ashaninka Nation. His people live in Brazil and in Peru. Benki comes from a village so remote up in the Amazon that to get there  either you have to fly and land on water  or go by canoe for several days. I met Benki three years ago in Sao Paulo when I'd brought him and other leaders from indigenous peoples to meet with me and leaders from around the world  because we wanted to learn from each other. We wanted to share our stories with each other. The Ashaninka people are known throughout South America for their dignity  their spirit and their resistance  starting with the Incas and continuing through the   th century with the rubber tappers. Today's biggest threat to the Ashaninka people and to Benki comes from illegal logging    the people who come into the beautiful forest and cut down ancient mahogany trees  float them down the river to world markets. Benki knew this. He could see what was happening to his forest  to his environment  because he was taken under his grandfather's wing when he was only two years old to begin to learn about the forest and the way of life of his people. His grandfather died when he was only   . And at that young age     years old  Benki became the paje of his community. Now  in the Ashaninka tradition and culture  the paje is the most important person in the community. This is the person who contains within him all the knowledge  all the wisdom of centuries and centuries of life  and not just about his people  but about everything that his people's survival depended on  the trees  the birds  the water  the soil  the forest. So when he was only    and he became the paje  he began to lead his people. He began to talk to them about the forest that they needed to protect  the way of life they needed to nurture. He explained to them that it was not a question of survival of the fittest  it was a question of understanding what they needed to survive and to protect that. Eight years later  when he was a young man of     Benki left the forest for the first time. He went       miles on an odyssey to Rio to the Earth Summit to tell the world what was happening in his tiny  little corner. And he went because he hoped the world would listen. Some did  not everybody. But if you can imagine this young man with his headdress and his flowing robe  learning a new language  Portuguese  not to mention English  going to Rio  building a bridge to reach out to people he'd never met before    a pretty hostile world. But he wasn't dismayed. Benki came back to his village full of ideas    new technologies  new research  new ways of understanding what was going on. Since that time  he's continued to work with his people  and not only the Ashaninka Nation  but all the peoples of the Amazon and beyond. He's built schools to teach children to care for the forest. Together  he's led the reforestation of over    percent of the land that had been destroyed by the loggers. He's created a cooperative to help people diversify their livelihoods. And he's brought the internet and satellite technology to the forest    both so that people themselves could monitor the deforestation  but also that he could speak from the forest to the rest of the world. If you were to meet Benki and ask him   Why are you doing this  Why are you putting yourself at risk  Why are you making yourself vulnerable to what is often a hostile world   he would tell you  as he told me   I asked myself   he said   What did my grandparents and my great grandparents do to protect the forest for me  And what am I doing   So when I think of that  I wonder what our grandchildren and our great grandchildren  when they ask themselves that question  I wonder how they will answer. For me  the world is veering towards a future we don't much want when we really think about it deep inside. It's a future we don't know the details of  but it's a future that has signs  just like Benki saw the signs around him. We know we are running out of what we need. We're running out of fresh water. We're running out of fossil fuels. We're running out of land. We know climate change is going to affect all of us. We don't know how  but we know it will. And we know that there will be more of us than ever before    five times as many people in    years than    years ago. We are running out of what we need. And we also know that the world has changed in other ways  that since      there are one third as many new countries that exist as independent entities on the planet. Egos  systems of government    figuring it out    massive change. And in addition to that  we know that five other really big countries are going to have a say in the future  a say we haven't even really started to hear yet    China  India  Russia  South Africa and Benki's own Brazil  where Benki got his civil rights only in the      constitution. But you know all that. You know more than Benki knew when he left his forest and went       miles. You also know that we can't just keep doing what we've always done  because we'll get the results we've always gotten. And this reminds me of something I understand Lord Salisbury said to Queen Victoria over a hundred years ago  when she was pressing him   Please change.  He said   Change  Why change  Things are bad enough as they are.  We have to change. It's imperative to me  when I look around the world  that we need to change ourselves. We need new models of what it means to be a leader. We need new models of being a leader and a human in the world. I started life as a banker. Now I don't admit to that to anybody but my very close friends. But for the past eight years  I've done something completely different. My work has taken me around the world  where I've had the real privilege of meeting people like Benki and many others who are making change happen in their communities    people who see the world differently  who are asking different questions  who have different answers  who understand the filters that they wear when they go out into the world. This is Sanghamitra. Sanghamitra comes from Bangalore. I met Sanghamitra eight years ago when I was in Bangalore organizing a workshop with leaders of different NGO's working in some of the hardest aspects of society. Sanghamitra didn't start life as a leader of an NGO  she started her career as university professor  teaching English literature. But she realized that she was much too detached from the world doing that. She loved it  but she was too detached. And so in       a long time ago  she decided to start a new organization called Samraksha focused on one of the hardest areas  one of the hardest issues in India    anywhere in the world at the time    HIV AIDS. Since that time  Samraksha has grown from strength to strength and is now one of the leading health NGO's in India. But if you just think about the state of the world and knowledge of HIV AIDS in         in India at that time it was skyrocketing and nobody understood why  and everyone was actually very  very afraid. Today there are still three million HIV positive people in India. That's the second largest population in the world. When I asked Sanghamitra   How did you get from English literature to HIV AIDS   not an obvious path  she said to me   It's all connected. Literature makes one sensitive  sensitive to people  to their dreams and to their ideas.  Since that time  under her leadership  Samraksha has been a pioneer in all fields related to HIV AIDS. They have respite homes  the first  the first care centers  the first counseling services    and not just in urban    million population Bangalore  but in the hardest to reach villages in the state of Karnataka. Even that wasn't enough. She wanted to change policy at the government level.    of their programs that she pioneered are now government policy and funded by the government. They take care of        odd people today in over       villages around Karnataka. She works with people like Murali Krishna. Murali Krishna comes from one of those villages. He lost his wife to AIDS a couple of years ago  and he's HIV positive. But he saw the work  the care  the compassion that Sanghamitra and her team brought to the village  and he wanted to be part of it. He's a Leaders' Quest fellow  and that helps him with his work. They've pioneered a different approach to villages. Instead of handing out information in pamphlets  as is so often the case  they bring theater troupes  songs  music  dance. And they sit around  and they talk about dreams. Sanghamitra told me just last week    she had just come back from two weeks in the villages  and she had a real breakthrough. They were sitting in a circle  talking about the dreams for the village. And the young women in the village spoke up and said   We've changed our dream. Our dream is for our partners  our husbands  not to be given to us because of a horoscope  but to be given to us because they've been tested for HIV.  If you are lucky enough to meet Sanghamitra and ask her why and how  how have you achieved so much  She would look at you and very quietly  very softly say   It just happened. It's the spirit inside.  This is Dr. Fan Jianchuan. Jianchuan comes from Sichuan Province in southwest China. He was born in       and you can imagine what his childhood looked like and felt like  and what his life has been like over the last    tumultuous years. He's been a soldier  a teacher  a politician  a vice mayor and a business man. But if you sat down and asked him   Who are you really  and what do you do   He would tell you   I'm a collector  and I curate a museum.  I was lucky  I had heard about him for years  and I finally met him earlier this year at his museum in Chengdu. He's been a collector all of his life  starting when he was four or five in the early     's. Now  just think of the early     's in China. Over a lifetime  through everything  through the Cultural Revolution and everything afterward  he's kept collecting  so that he now has over eight million pieces in his museums documenting contemporary Chinese history. These are pieces that you won't find anywhere else in the world  in part because they document parts of history Chinese choose to forget. For example  he's got over one million pieces documenting the Sino Japanese War  a war that's not talked about in China very much and whose heroes are not honored. Why did he do all this  Because he thought a nation should never repeat the mistakes of the past. So  from commissioning slightly larger than life bronze statues of the heroes of the Sino Japanese War  including those Chinese who then fought with each other and left mainland China to go to Taiwan  to commemorating all the unknown  ordinary soldiers who survived  by asking them to take prints of their hands  he is making sure    one man is making sure    that history is not forgotten. But it's not just Chinese heroes he cares about. This building contains the world's largest collection of documents and artifacts commemorating the U.S. role in fighting on the Chinese side in that long war    the Flying Tigers. He has nine other buildings    that are already open to the public    filled to the rafters with artifacts documenting contemporary Chinese history. Two of the most sensitive buildings include a lifetime of collection about the Cultural Revolution  a period that actually most Chinese would prefer to forget. But he doesn't want his nation ever to forget. These people inspire me  and they inspire me because they show us what is possible when you change the way you look at the world  change the way you look at your place in the world. They looked outside  and then they changed what was on the inside. They didn't go to business school. They didn't read a manual   How to Be a Good Leader in    Easy Steps.  But they have qualities we'd all recognize. They have drive  passion  commitment. They've gone away from what they did before  and they've gone to something they didn't know. They've tried to connect worlds they didn't know existed before. They've built bridges  and they've walked across them. They have a sense of the great arc of time and their tiny place in it. They know people have come before them and will follow them. And they know that they're part of a whole  that they depend on other people. It's not about them  they know that  but it has to start with them. And they have humility. It just happens. But we know it doesn't just happen  don't we  We know it takes a lot to make it happen  and we know the direction the world is going in. So I think we need succession planning on a global basis. We can't wait for the next generation  the new joiners  to come in and learn how to be the good leaders we need. I think it has to start with us. And we know  just like they knew  how hard it is. But the good news is that we don't have to figure it out as we go along  we have models  we have examples  like Benki and Sanghamitra and Jianchuan. We can look at what they've done  if we look. We can learn from what they've learned. We can change the way we see ourselves in the world. And if we're lucky  we can change the way our great grandchildren will answer Benki's question. Thank you. To understand the business of mythology and what a Chief Belief Officer is supposed to do  you have to hear a story of Ganesha  the elephant headed god who is the scribe of storytellers  and his brother  the athletic warlord of the gods  Kartikeya. The two brothers one day decided to go on a race  three times around the world. Kartikeya leapt on his peacock and flew around the continents and the mountains and the oceans. He went around once  he went around twice  he went around thrice. But his brother  Ganesha  simply walked around his parents once  twice  thrice  and said   I won.   How come   said Kartikeya. And Ganesha said   You went around 'the world.' I went around 'my world.'  What matters more  If you understand the difference between 'the world' and 'my world ' you understand the difference between logos and mythos. 'The world' is objective  logical  universal  factual  scientific. 'My world' is subjective. It's emotional. It's personal. It's perceptions  thoughts  feelings  dreams. It is the belief system that we carry. It's the myth that we live in. 'The world' tells us how the world functions  how the sun rises  how we are born. 'My world' tells us why the sun rises  why we were born. Every culture is trying to understand itself   Why do we exist   And every culture comes up with its own understanding of life  its own customized version of mythology. Culture is a reaction to nature  and this understanding of our ancestors is transmitted generation from generation in the form of stories  symbols and rituals  which are always indifferent to rationality. And so  when you study it  you realize that different people of the world have a different understanding of the world. Different people see things differently    different viewpoints. There is my world and there is your world  and my world is always better than your world  because my world  you see  is rational and yours is superstition. Yours is faith. Yours is illogical. This is the root of the clash of civilizations. It took place  once  in     B.C. on the banks of a river called the Indus  now in Pakistan. This river lends itself to India's name. India. Indus. Alexander  a young Macedonian  met there what he called a  gymnosophist   which means  the naked  wise man.  We don't know who he was. Perhaps he was a Jain monk  like Bahubali over here  the Gomateshwara Bahubali whose image is not far from Mysore. Or perhaps he was just a yogi who was sitting on a rock  staring at the sky and the sun and the moon. Alexander asked   What are you doing   and the gymnosophist answered   I'm experiencing nothingness.  Then the gymnosophist asked   What are you doing   and Alexander said   I am conquering the world.  And they both laughed. Each one thought that the other was a fool. The gymnosophist said   Why is he conquering the world  It's pointless.  And Alexander thought   Why is he sitting around  doing nothing  What a waste of a life.  To understand this difference in viewpoints  we have to understand the subjective truth of Alexander    his myth  and the mythology that constructed it. Alexander's mother  his parents  his teacher Aristotle told him the story of Homer's  Iliad.  They told him of a great hero called Achilles  who  when he participated in battle  victory was assured  but when he withdrew from the battle  defeat was inevitable.  Achilles was a man who could shape history  a man of destiny  and this is what you should be  Alexander.  That's what he heard.  What should you not be  You should not be Sisyphus  who rolls a rock up a mountain all day only to find the boulder rolled down at night. Don't live a life which is monotonous  mediocre  meaningless. Be spectacular     like the Greek heroes  like Jason  who went across the sea with the Argonauts and fetched the Golden Fleece. Be spectacular like Theseus  who entered the labyrinth and killed the bull headed Minotaur. When you play in a race  win     because when you win  the exhilaration of victory is the closest you will come to the ambrosia of the gods.  Because  you see  the Greeks believed you live only once  and when you die  you have to cross the River Styx. And if you have lived an extraordinary life  you will be welcomed to Elysium  or what the French call  Champs  lys es     the heaven of the heroes. But these are not the stories that the gymnosophist heard. He heard a very different story. He heard of a man called Bharat  after whom India is called Bh rata. Bharat also conquered the world. And then he went to the top most peak of the greatest mountain of the center of the world called Meru. And he wanted to hoist his flag to say   I was here first.  But when he reached the mountain peak  he found the peak covered with countless flags of world conquerors before him  each one claiming  'I was here first' ... that's what I thought until I came here.  And suddenly  in this canvas of infinity  Bharat felt insignificant. This was the mythology of the gymnosophist. You see  he had heroes  like Ram    Raghupati Ram and Krishna  Govinda Hari. But they were not two characters on two different adventures. They were two lifetimes of the same hero. When the Ramayana ends the Mahabharata begins. When Ram dies  Krishna is born. When Krishna dies  eventually he will be back as Ram. You see  the Indians also had a river that separates the land of the living from the land of the dead. But you don't cross it once. You go to and fro endlessly. It was called the Vaitarani. You go again and again and again. Because  you see  nothing lasts forever in India  not even death. And so  you have these grand rituals where great images of mother goddesses are built and worshiped for    days ... And what do you do at the end of    days  You dunk it in the river. Because it has to end. And next year  she will come back. What goes around always comes around  and this rule applies not just to man  but also the gods. You see  the gods have to come back again and again and again as Ram  as Krishna. Not only do they live infinite lives  but the same life is lived infinite times till you get to the point of it all.  Groundhog Day.  Two different mythologies. Which is right  Two different mythologies  two different ways of looking at the world. One linear  one cyclical. One believes this is the one and only life. The other believes this is one of many lives. And so  the denominator of Alexander's life was one. So  the value of his life was the sum total of his achievements. The denominator of the gymnosophist's life was infinity. So  no matter what he did  it was always zero. And I believe it is this mythological paradigm that inspired Indian mathematicians to discover the number zero. Who knows  And that brings us to the mythology of business. If Alexander's belief influenced his behavior  if the gymnosophist's belief influences his behavior  then it was bound to influence the business they were in. You see  what is business but the result of how the market behaves and how the organization behaves  And if you look at cultures around the world  all you have to do is understand the mythology and you will see how they behave and how they do business. Take a look. If you live only once  in one life cultures around the world  you will see an obsession with binary logic  absolute truth  standardization  absoluteness  linear patterns in design. But if you look at cultures which have cyclical and based on infinite lives  you will see a comfort with fuzzy logic  with opinion  with contextual thinking  with everything is relative  sort of    mostly. You look at art. Look at the ballerina  how linear she is in her performance. And then look at the Indian classical dancer  the Kuchipudi dancer  the Bharatanatyam dancer  curvaceous. And then look at business. Standard business model  vision  mission  values  processes. Sounds very much like the journey through the wilderness to the promised land  with the commandments held by the leader. And if you comply  you will go to heaven. But in India there is no  the  promised land. There are many promised lands  depending on your station in society  depending on your stage of life. You see  businesses are not run as institutions  by the idiosyncrasies of individuals. It's always about taste. It's always about my taste. You see  Indian music  for example  does not have the concept of harmony. There is no orchestra conductor. There is one performer standing there  and everybody follows. And you can never replicate that performance twice. It is not about documentation and contract. It's about conversation and faith. It's not about compliance. It's about setting  getting the job done  by bending or breaking the rules    just look at your Indian people around here  you'll see them smile  they know what it is. And then look at people who have done business in India  you'll see the exasperation on their faces. You see  this is what India is today. The ground reality is based on a cyclical world view. So  it's rapidly changing  highly diverse  chaotic  ambiguous  unpredictable. And people are okay with it. And then globalization is taking place. The demands of modern institutional thinking is coming in. Which is rooted in one life culture. And a clash is going to take place  like on the banks of the Indus. It is bound to happen. I have personally experienced it. I'm trained as a medical doctor. I did not want to study surgery. Don't ask me why. I love mythology too much. I wanted to learn mythology. But there is nowhere you can study. So  I had to teach it to myself. And mythology does not pay  well  until now. So  I had to take up a job. And I worked in the pharma industry. And I worked in the healthcare industry. And I worked as a marketing guy  and a sales guy  and a knowledge guy  and a content guy  and a training guy. I even was a business consultant  doing strategies and tactics. And I would see the exasperation between my American and European colleagues  when they were dealing with India. Example  Please tell us the process to invoice hospitals. Step A. Step B. Step C. Mostly. How do you parameterize  mostly   How do you put it in a nice little software  You can't. I would give my viewpoints to people. But nobody was interested in listening to it  you see  until I met Kishore Biyani of the Future group. You see  he has established the largest retail chain  called Big Bazaar. And there are more than     formats  across    cities and towns of India. And he was dealing with diverse and dynamic markets. And he knew very intuitively  that best practices  developed in Japan and China and Europe and America will not work in India. He knew that institutional thinking doesn't work in India. Individual thinking does. He had an intuitive understanding of the mythic structure of India. So  he had asked me to be the Chief Belief Officer  and said   All I want to do is align belief.  Sounds so simple. But belief is not measurable. You can't measure it. You can't manage it. So  how do you construct belief  How do you enhance the sensitivity of people to Indian ness. Even if you are Indian  it is not very explicit  it is not very obvious. So  I tried to work on the standard model of culture  which is  develop stories  symbols and rituals. And I will share one of the rituals with you. You see it is based on the Hindu ritual of Darshan. Hindus don't have the concept of commandments. So  there is nothing right or wrong in what you do in life. So  you're not really sure how you stand in front of God. So  when you go to the temple  all you seek is an audience with God. You want to see God. And you want God to see you  and hence the gods have very large eyes  large unblinking eyes  sometimes made of silver  so they look at you. Because you don't know whether you're right or wrong  and so all you seek is divine empathy.  Just know where I came from  why I did the Jugaad.   Why did I do the setting  why I don't care for the processes. Just understand me  please.  And based on this  we created a ritual for leaders. After a leader completes his training and is about to take over the store  we blindfold him  we surround him with the stakeholders  the customer  his family  his team  his boss. You read out his KRA  his KPI  you give him the keys  and then you remove the blindfold. And invariably  you see a tear  because the penny has dropped. He realizes that to succeed  he does not have to be a  professional   he does not have to cut out his emotions  he has to include all these people in his world to succeed  to make them happy  to make the boss happy  to make everyone happy. The customer is happy  because the customer is God. That sensitivity is what we need. Once this belief enters  behavior will happen  business will happen. And it has. So  then we come back to Alexander and to the gymnosophist. And everybody asks me   Which is the better way  this way or that way   And it's a very dangerous question  because it leads you to the path of fundamentalism and violence. So  I will not answer the question. What I will give you is an Indian answer  the Indian head shake. Depending on the context  depending on the outcome  choose your paradigm. You see  because both the paradigms are human constructions. They are cultural creations  not natural phenomena. And so the next time you meet someone  a stranger  one request  Understand that you live in the subjective truth  and so does he. Understand it. And when you understand it you will discover something spectacular. You will discover that within infinite myths lies the eternal truth. Who sees it all  Varuna has but a thousand eyes. Indra  a hundred. You and I  only two. Thank you. Namaste. As technology progresses  and as it advances  many of us assume that these advances make us more intelligent  make us smarter and more connected to the world. And what I'd like to argue is that that's not necessarily the case  as progress is simply a word for change  and with change you gain something  but you also lose something. And to really illustrate this point  what I'd like to do is to show you how technology has dealt with a very simple  a very common  an everyday question. And that question is this. What time is it  What time is it  If you glance at your iPhone  it's so simple to tell the time. But  I'd like to ask you  how would you tell the time if you didn't have an iPhone  How would you tell the time  say      years ago  How would you do it  Well  the way you would do it is by using a device that's called an astrolabe. So  an astrolabe is relatively unknown in today's world. But  at the time  in the   th century  it was the gadget of the day. It was the world's first popular computer. And it was a device that  in fact  is a model of the sky. So  the different parts of the astrolabe  in this particular type  the rete corresponds to the positions of the stars. The plate corresponds to a coordinate system. And the mater has some scales and puts it all together. If you were an educated child  you would know how to not only use the astrolabe  you would also know how to make an astrolabe. And we know this because the first treatise on the astrolabe  the first technical manual in the English language  was written by Geoffrey Chaucer. Yes  that Geoffrey Chaucer  in       to his little Lewis  his    year old son. And in this book  little Lewis would know the big idea. And the central idea that makes this computer work is this thing called stereographic projection. And basically  the concept is  how do you represent the three dimensional image of the night sky that surrounds us onto a flat  portable  two dimensional surface. The idea is actually relatively simple. Imagine that that Earth is at the center of the universe  and surrounding it is the sky projected onto a sphere. Each point on the surface of the sphere is mapped through the bottom pole  onto a flat surface  where it is then recorded. So the North Star corresponds to the center of the device. The ecliptic  which is the path of the sun  moon  and planets correspond to an offset circle. The bright stars correspond to little daggers on the rete. And the altitude corresponds to the plate system. Now  the real genius of the astrolabe is not just the projection. The real genius is that it brings together two coordinate systems so they fit perfectly. There is the position of the sun  moon and planets on the movable rete. And then there is their location on the sky as seen from a certain latitude on the back plate. Okay  So how would you use this device  Well  let me first back up for a moment. This is an astrolabe. Pretty impressive  isn't it  And so  this astrolabe is on loan from us from the Oxford School of    Museum of History. And you can see the different components. This is the mater  the scales on the back. This is the rete. Okay. Do you see that  That's the movable part of the sky. And in the back you can see a spider web pattern. And that spider web pattern corresponds to the local coordinates in the sky. This is a rule device. And on the back are some other devices  measuring tools and scales  to be able to make some calculations. Okay  You know  I've always wanted one of these. For my thesis I actually built one of these out of paper. And this one  this is a replica from a   th century device. And it's worth probably about three MacBook Pros. But a real one would cost about as much as my house  and the house next to it  and actually every house on the block  on both sides of the street  maybe a school thrown in  and some    you know  a church. They are just incredibly expensive. But let me show you how to work this device. So let's go to step one. First thing that you do is you select a star in the night sky  if you're telling time at night. So  tonight  if it's clear you'll be able to see the summer triangle. And there is a bright star called Deneb. So let's select Deneb. Second  is you measure the altitude of Deneb. So  step two  I hold the device up  and then I sight its altitude there so I can see it clearly now. And then I measure its altitude. So  it's about    degrees. You can't see it from over there. Step three is identify the star on the front of the device. Deneb is there. I can tell. Step four is I then move the rete  move the sky  so the altitude of the star corresponds to the scale on the back. Okay  so when that happens everything lines up. I have here a model of the sky that corresponds to the real sky. Okay  So  it is  in a sense  holding a model of the universe in my hands. And then finally  I take a rule  and move the rule to a date line which then tells me the time here. Right. So  that's how the device is used. So  I know what you're thinking   That's a lot of work  isn't it  Isn't it a ton of work to be able to tell the time   as you glance at your iPod to just check out the time. But there is a difference between the two  because with your iPod you can tell    or your iPhone  you can tell exactly what the time is  with precision. The way little Lewis would tell the time is by a picture of the sky. He would know where things would fit in the sky. He would not only know what time it was  he would also know where the sun would rise  and how it would move across the sky. He would know what time the sun would rise  and what time it would set. And he would know that for essentially every celestial object in the heavens. So  in computer graphics and computer user interface design  there is a term called affordances. So  affordances are the qualities of an object that allow us to perform an action with it. And what the astrolabe does is it allows us  it affords us  to connect to the night sky  to look up into the night sky and be much more    to see the visible and the invisible together. So  that's just one use. Incredible  there is probably          uses. In fact  there is a text  and that has over a thousand uses of this first computer. On the back there is scales and measurements for terrestrial navigation. You can survey with it. The city of Baghdad was surveyed with it. It can be used for calculating mathematical equations of all different types. And it would take a full university course to illustrate it. Astrolabes have an incredible history. They are over       years old. The concept of stereographic projection originated in     B.C. And the astrolabes come in many different sizes and shapes and forms. There is portable ones. There is large display ones. And I think what is common to all astrolabes is that they are beautiful works of art. There is a quality of craftsmanship and precision that is just astonishing and remarkable. Astrolabes  like every technology  do evolve over time. So  the earliest retes  for example  were very simple and primitive. And advancing retes became cultural emblems. This is one from Oxford. And I find this one really extraordinary because the rete pattern is completely symmetrical  and it accurately maps a completely asymmetrical  or random sky. How cool is that  This is just amazing. So  would little Lewis have an astrolabe  Probably not one made of brass. He would have one made out of wood  or paper. And the vast majority of this first computer was a portable device that you could keep in the back of your pocket. So  what does the astrolabe inspire  Well  I think the first thing is that it reminds us just how resourceful people were  our forebears were  years and years ago. It's just an incredible device. Every technology advances. Every technology is transformed and moved by others. And what we gain with a new technology  of course  is precision and accuracy. But what we lose  I think  is an accurate    a felt sense of the sky  a sense of context. Knowing the sky  knowing your relationship with the sky  is the center of the real answer to knowing what time it is. So  it's    I think astrolabes are just remarkable devices. And so  what can you learn from these devices  Well  primarily that there is a subtle knowledge that we can connect with the world. And astrolabes return us to this subtle sense of how things all fit together  and also how we connect to the world. Thanks very much. Once upon a time  at the age of     I was a student at St. John's Medical College in Bangalore. I was a guest student during one month of a public health course. And that changed my mindset forever. The course was good  but it was not the course content in itself that changed the mindset. It was the brutal realization  the first morning  that the Indian students were better than me. You see  I was a study nerd. I loved statistics from a young age. And I studied very much in Sweden. I used to be in the upper quarter of all courses I attended. But in St. John's  I was in the lower quarter. And the fact was that Indian students studied harder than we did in Sweden. They read the textbook twice  or three times or four times. In Sweden we read it once and then we went partying. And that  to me  that personal experience was the first time in my life that the mindset I grew up with was changed. And I realized that perhaps the Western world will not continue to dominate the world forever. And I think many of you have the same sort of personal experience. It's that realization of someone you meet that really made you change your ideas about the world. It's not the statistics  although I tried to make it funny. And I will now  here  onstage  try to predict when that will happen    that Asia will regain its dominant position as the leading part of the world  as it used to be  over thousands of years. And I will do that by trying to predict precisely at what year the average income per person in India  in China  will reach that of the West. And I don't mean the whole economy  because to grow an economy of India to the size of U.K.    that's a piece of cake  with one billion people. But I want to see when will the average pay  the money for each person  per month  in India and China  when will that have reached that of U.K. and the United States  But I will start with a historical background. And you can see my map if I get it up here. You know  I will start at     .      was a year of great technological advancement in the West. That was the year when Queen Victoria was able  for the first time  to communicate with President Buchanan  through the Transatlantic Telegraphic Cable. And they were the first to  Twitter  transatlantically. And I've been able  through this wonderful Google and Internet  to find the text of the telegram sent back from President Buchanan to Queen Victoria. And it ends like this   This telegraph is a fantastic instrument to diffuse religion  civilization  liberty and law throughout the world.  Those are nice words. But I got sort of curious of what he meant with liberty  and liberty for whom. And we will think about that when we look at the wider picture of the world in     . Because      was also watershed year in the history of Asia.      was the year when the courageous uprising against the foreign occupation of India was defeated by the British forces. And India was up to    years more of foreign domination.      in China was the victory in the Opium War by the British forces. And that meant that foreigners  as it said in the treaty  were allowed to trade freely in China. It meant paying with opium for Chinese goods. And      in Japan was the year when Japan had to sign the Harris Treaty and accept trade on favorable condition for the U.S. And they were threatened by those black ships there  that had been in Tokyo harbor over the last year. But  Japan  in contrast to India and China  maintained its national sovereignty. And let's see how much difference that can make. And I will do that by bringing these bubbles back to a Gapminder graph here  where you can see each bubble is a country. The size of the bubble here is the population. On this axis  as I used to have income per person in comparable dollar. And on that axis I have life expectancy  the health of people. And I also bring an innovation here. I have transformed the laser beam into an ecological  recyclable version here  in green India. And we will see  you know. Look here        India was here  China was here  Japan was there  United States and United Kingdom was richer over there. And I will start the world like this. India was not always like this level. Actually if we go back into the historical record  there was a time hundreds of years ago when the income per person in India and China was even above that of Europe. But      had already been many  many years of foreign domination  and India had been de industrialized. And you can see that the countries who were growing their economy was United States and United Kingdom. And they were also  by the end of the century  getting healthy  and Japan was starting to catch up. India was trying down here. Can you see how it starts to move there  But really  really natural sovereignty was good for Japan. And Japan is trying to move up there. And it's the new century now. Health is getting better  United Kingdom  United States. But careful now    we are approaching the First World War. And the First World War  you know  we'll see a lot of deaths and economical problems here. United Kingdom is going down. And now comes the Spanish flu also. And then after the First World War  they continue up. Still under foreign domination  and without sovereignty  India and China are down in the corner. Not much has happened. They have grown their population but not much more. In the     's now  you can see that Japan is going to a period of war  with lower life expectancy. And the Second World War was really a terrible event  also economically for Japan. But they did recover quite fast afterwards. And we are moving into the new world. In      India finally gained its independence. And they could raise the Indian flag and become a sovereign nation  but in very big difficulties down there. In      we saw the emergence of the modern China in a way which surprised the world. And what happened  What happens in the after independence  You can see that the health started to improve. Children started to go to school. Health services were provided. This is the Great Leap Forward  when China fell down. It was central planning by Mao Tse Tung. China recovered. Then they said   Nevermore  stupid central planning.  But they went up here  and India was trying to follow. And they were catching up indeed. And both countries had the better health  but still a very low economy. And we came to       and Mao Tse Tung died  and a new guy turned up from the left. And it was Deng Xiaoping coming out here. And he said   Doesn't matter if a cat is white or black  as long as it catches mice.  Because catching mice is what the two cats wanted to do. And you can see the two cats being here  China and India  wanting to catch the mices over there  you know. And they decided to go not only for health and education  but also starting to grow their economy. And the market reformer was successful there. In '   India follows with a market reform. And they go quite closely together  and you can see that the similarity with India and China  in many ways  are greater than the differences with them. And here they march on. And will they catch up  This is the big question today. There they are today. Now what does it mean that the    the averages there    this is the average of China. If I would split China  look here  Shanghai has already catched up. Shanghai is already there. And it's healthier than the United States. But on the other hand  Guizhou  one of the poorest inland provinces of China  is there. And if I split Guizhou into urban and rural  the rural part of Guizhou goes down there. You see this enormous inequity in China  in the midst of fast economic growth. And if I would also look at India  you have another type of inequity  actually  in India. The geographical  macro geographical difference is not so big. Uttar Pradesh  the biggest of the states here  is poorer and has a lower health than the rest of India. Kerala is flying on top there  matching United States in health  but not in economy. And here  Maharashtra  with Mumbai  is forging forward. Now in India  the big inequities are within the state  rather than between the states. And that is not a bad thing  in itself. If you have a lot inequity  macro geographical inequities can be more difficult in the long term to deal with  than if it is in the same area where you have a growth center relatively close to where poor people are living. No  there is one more inequity. Look there  United States. Oh  they broke my frame. Washington  D.C. went out here. My friends at Gapminder wanted me to show this because there is a new leader in Washington who is really concerned about the health system. And I can understand him  because Washington  D.C. is so rich over there but they are not as healthy as Kerala. It's quite interesting  isn't it  I can see a business opportunity for Kerala  helping fix the health system in the United States. Now here we have the whole world. You have the legend down there. And when you see the two giant cats here  pushing forward  you see that in between them and ahead of them  is the whole emerging economies of the world  which Thomas Friedman so correctly called the  flat world.  You can see that in health and education  a large part of the world population is putting forward  but in Africa  and other parts  as in rural Guizhou in China  there is still people with low health and very low economy. We have an enormous disparity in the world. But most of the world in the middle are pushing forwards very fast. Now  back to my projections. When will it catch up  I have to go back to very conventional graph. I will show income per person on this axis instead  poor down here  rich up there. And then time here  from      I start the world. And we shall see what will happen with these countries. You see  China under foreign domination actually lowered their income and came down to the Indian level here. Whereas U.K. and United States is getting richer and richer. And after Second World War  United States is richer than U.K. But independence is coming here. Growth is starting  economic reform. Growth is faster  and with projection from IMF you can see where you expect them to be in     . Now  the question is   When will the catch up take place   Look at  look at the United States. Can you see the bubble  The bubbles  not my bubbles  but the financial bubbles. That's the dot com bubble. This is the Lehman Brothers doorstep there. You see it came down there. And it seems this is another rock coming down there  you know. So they doesn't seem to go this way  these countries. They seem to go in a more humble growth way  you know. And people interested in growth are turning their eyes towards Asia. I can compare to Japan. This is Japan coming up. You see  Japan did it like that. We add Japan to it. And there is no doubt that fast catch up can take place. Can you see here what Japan did  Japan did it like this  until full catch up  and then they follow with the other high income economies. But the real projections for those ones  I would like to give it like this. Can be worse  can be better. It's always difficult to predict  especially about the future. Now  a historian tells me it's even more difficult to predict about the past. I think I'm in a difficult position here. Inequalities in China and India I consider really the big obstacle because to bring the entire population into growth and prosperity is what will create a domestic market  what will avoid social instability  and which will make use of the entire capacity of the population. So  social investments in health  education and infrastructure  and electricity is really what is needed in India and China. You know the climate. We have great international experts within India telling us that the climate is changing  and actions has to be taken  otherwise China and India would be the countries most to suffer from climate change. And I consider India and China the best partners in the world in a good global climate policy. But they ain't going to pay for what others  who have more money  have largely created  and I can agree on that. But what I'm really worried about is war. Will the former rich countries really accept a completely changed world economy  and a shift of power away from where it has been the last    to     to     years  back to Asia  And will Asia be able to handle that new position of being in charge of being the most mighty  and the governors of the world  So  always avoid war  because that always pushes human beings backward. Now if these inequalities  climate and war can be avoided  get ready for a world in equity  because this is what seems to be happening. And that vision that I got as a young student        that Indians can be much better than Swedes  is just about to happen. And it will happen precisely the year      in the later part of the summer  in July  more precisely  the   th of July. The   th of July       is my    th birthday. And I expect to speak in the first session of the   th TED India. Get your bookings in time. Thank you very much. As a culture  we tell ourselves lots of stories about the future  and where we might move forward from this point. Some of those stories are that somebody is just going to sort everything out for us. Other stories are that everything is on the verge of unraveling. But I want to tell you a different story here today. Like all stories  it has a beginning. My work  for a long time  has been involved in education  in teaching people practical skills for sustainability  teaching people how to take responsibility for growing some of their own food  how to build buildings using local materials  how to generate their own energy  and so on. I lived in Ireland  built the first straw bale houses in Ireland  and some cob buildings and all this kind of thing. But all my work for many years was focused around the idea that sustainability means basically looking at the globalized economic growth model  and moderating what comes in at one end  and moderating the outputs at the other end. And then I came into contact with a way of looking at things which actually changed that profoundly. And in order to introduce you to that  I've got something here that I'm going to unveil  which is one of the great marvels of the modern age. And it's something so astounding and so astonishing that I think maybe as I remove this cloth a suitable gasp of amazement might be appropriate. If you could help me with that it would be fantastic. This is a liter of oil. This bottle of oil  distilled over a hundred million years of geological time  ancient sunlight  contains the energy equivalent of about five weeks hard human manual labor    equivalent to about    strong people coming round and working for you. We can turn it into a dazzling array of materials  medicine  modern clothing  laptops  a whole range of different things. It gives us an energy return that's unimaginable  historically. We've based the design of our settlements  our business models  our transport plans  even the idea of economic growth  some would argue  on the assumption that we will have this in perpetuity. Yet  when we take a step back  and look over the span of history  at what we might call the petroleum interval  it's a short period in history where we've discovered this extraordinary material  and then based a whole way of life around it. But as we straddle the top of this energy mountain  at this stage  we move from a time where our economic success  our sense of individual prowess and well being is directly linked to how much of this we consume  to a time when actually our degree of oil dependency is our degree of vulnerability. And it's increasingly clear that we aren't going to be able to rely on the fact that we're going to have this at our disposal forever. For every four barrels of oil that we consume  we only discover one. And that gap continues to widen. There is also the fact that the amount of energy that we get back from the oil that we discover is falling. In the     s we got     units of energy back for every one that we put in to extract it. Completely unprecedented  historically. Already that's fallen to about   . And that's why  now  the new breakthroughs  the new frontiers in terms of oil extraction are scrambling about in Alberta  or at the bottom of the oceans. There are    oil producing nations in the world. But of those     have already passed their peak. The moment when the world on average passes this peak  people wonder when that's going to happen. And there is an emerging case that maybe that was what happened last July when the oil prices were so high. But are we to assume that the same brilliance and creativity and adaptability that got us up to the top of that energy mountain in the first place is somehow mysteriously going to evaporate when we have to design a creative way back down the other side  No. But the thinking that we have to come up with has to be based on a realistic assessment of where we are. There is also the issue of climate change  is the other thing that underpins this transition approach. But the thing that I notice  as I talk to climate scientists  is the increasingly terrified look they have in their eyes  as the data that's coming in  which is far ahead of what the IPCC are talking about. So the IPCC said that we might see significant breakup of the arctic ice in       in their worst case scenario. Actually  if current trends continue  it could all be gone in five or    years' time. If just three percent of the carbon locked up in the arctic permafrost is released as the world warms  it would offset all the savings that we need to make  in carbon  over the next    years to avoid runaway climate change. We have no choice other than deep and urgent decarbonization. But I'm always very interested to think about what might the stories be that the generations further down the slope from us are going to tell about us.  The generation that lived at the top of the mountain  that partied so hard  and so abused its inheritance.  And one of the ways I like to do that is to look back at the stories people used to tell before we had cheap oil  before we had fossil fuels  and people relied on their own muscle  animal muscle energy  or a little bit of wind  little bit of water energy. We had stories like  The Seven League Boots   the giant who had these boots  where  once you put them on  with every stride you could cover seven leagues  or    miles  a kind of travel completely unimaginable to people without that kind of energy at their disposal. Stories like The Magic Porridge Pot  where you had a pot where if you knew the magic words  this pot would just make as much food as you liked  without you having to do any work  provided you could remember the other magic word to stop it making porridge. Otherwise you'd flood your entire town with warm porridge. There is the story of  The Elves and the Shoemaker.  The people who make shoes go to sleep  wake up in the morning  and all the shoes are magically made for them. It's something that was unimaginable to people then. Now we have the seven league boots in the form of Ryanair and Easyjet. We have the magic porridge pot in the form of Walmart and Tesco. And we have the elves in the form of China. But we don't appreciate what an astonishing thing that has been. And what are the stories that we tell ourselves now  as we look forward about where we're going to go. And I would argue that there are four. There is the idea of business as usual  that the future will be like the present  just more of it. But as we've seen over the last year  I think that's an idea that is increasingly coming into question. And in terms of climate change  is something that is not actually feasible. There is the idea of hitting the wall  that actually somehow everything is so fragile that it might just all unravel and collapse. This is a popular story in some places. The third story is the idea that technology can solve everything  that technology can somehow get us through this completely. And it's an idea that I think is very prevalent at these TED Talks  the idea that we can invent our way out of a profound economic and energy crisis  that a move to a knowledge economy can somehow neatly sidestep those energy constraints  the idea that we'll discover some fabulous new source of energy that will mean we can sweep all concerns about energy security to one side  the idea that we can step off neatly onto a completely renewable world. But the world isn't Second Life. We can't create new land and new energy systems at the click of a mouse. And as we sit  exchanging free ideas with each other  there are still people mining coal in order to power the servers  extracting the minerals to make all of those things. The breakfast that we eat as we sit down to check our email in the morning is still transported at great distances  usually at the expense of the local  more resilient food systems that would have supplied that in the past  which we've so effectively devalued and dismantled. We can be astonishingly inventive and creative. But we also live in a world with very real constraints and demands. Energy and technology are not the same thing. What I'm involved with is the transition response. And this is really about looking the challenges of peak oil and climate change square in the face  and responding with a creativity and an adaptability and an imagination that we really need. It's something which has spread incredibly fast. And it is something which has several characteristics. It's viral. It seems to spread under the radar very  very quickly. It's open source. It's something which everybody who's involved with it develops and passes on as they work with it. It's self organizing. There is no great central organization that pushes this  people just pick up an idea and they run with it  and they implement it where they are. It's solutions focused. It's very much looking at what people can do where they are  to respond to this. It's sensitive to place and to scale. Transitional is completely different. Transition groups in Chile  transition groups in the U.S.  transition groups here  what they're doing looks very different in every place that you go to. It learns very much from its mistakes. And it feels historic. It tries to create a sense that this is a historic opportunity to do something really extraordinary. And it's a process which is really joyful. People have a huge amount of fun doing this  reconnecting with other people as they do it. One of the things that underpins it is this idea of resilience. And I think  in many ways  the idea of resilience is a more useful concept than the idea of sustainability. The idea of resilience comes from the study of ecology. And it's really about how systems  settlements  withstand shock from the outside. When they encounter shock from the outside that they don't just unravel and fall to pieces. And I think it's a more useful concept than sustainability  as I said. When our supermarkets have only two or three days' worth of food in them at any one time  often sustainability tends to focus on the energy efficiency of the freezers and on the packaging that the lettuces are wrapped up in. Looking through the lens of resilience  we really question how we've let ourselves get into a situation that's so vulnerable. Resilience runs much deeper  it's about building modularity into what we do  building surge breakers into how we organize the basic things that support us. This is a photograph of the Bristol and District Market Gardeners Association  in     . This is at a time when the city of Bristol  which is quite close to here  was surrounded by commercial market gardens  which provided a significant amount of the food that was consumed in the town  and created a lot of employment for people  as well. There was a degree of resilience  if you like  at that time  which we can now only look back on with envy. So how does this transition idea work  So basically  you have a group of people who are excited by the idea. They pick up some of the tools that we've developed. They start to run an awareness raising program looking at how this might actually work in the town. They show films  they give talks  and so on. It's a process which is playful and creative and informative. Then they start to form working groups  looking at different aspects of this  and then from that  there emerge a whole lot of projects which then the transition project itself starts to support and enable. So it started out with some work I was involved in in Ireland  where I was teaching  and has since spread. There are now over     formal transition projects. And there are thousands of others who are at what we call the mulling stage. They are mulling whether they're going to take it further. And actually a lot of them are doing huge amounts of stuff. But what do they actually do  You know  it's a kind of nice idea  but what do they actually do on the ground  Well  I think it's really important to make the point that actually you know  this isn't something which is going to do everything on its own. We need international legislation from Copenhagen and so on. We need national responses. We need local government responses. But all of those things are going to be much easier if we have communities that are vibrant and coming up with ideas and leading from the front  making unelectable policies electable  over the next   to    years. Some of the things that emerge from it are local food projects  like community supported agriculture schemes  urban food production  creating local food directories  and so on. A lot of places now are starting to set up their own energy companies  community owned energy companies  where the community can invest money into itself  to start putting in place the kind of renewable energy infrastructure that we need. A lot of places are working with their local schools. Newent in the Forest of Dean  big polytunnel they built for the school  the kids are learning how to grow food. Promoting recycling  things like garden share  that matches up people who don't have a garden who would like to grow food  with people who have gardens they aren't using anymore. Planting productive trees throughout urban spaces. And also starting to play around with the idea of alternative currencies. This is Lewes in Sussex  who have recently launched the Lewes Pound  a currency that you can only spend within the town  as a way of starting to cycle money within the local economy. You take it anywhere else  it's not worth anything. But actually within the town you start to create these economic cycles much more effectively. Another thing that they do is what we call an energy descent plan  which is basically to develop a plan B for the town. Most of our local authorities  when they sit down to plan for the next five             years of a community  still start by assuming that there will be more energy  more cars  more housing  more jobs  more growth  and so on. What does it look like if that's not the case  And how can we embrace that and actually come up with something that was actually more likely to sustain everybody  As a friend of mine says   Life is a series of things you're not quite ready for.  And that's certainly been my experience with transition. From three years ago  it just being an idea  this has become something that has virally swept around the world. We're getting a lot of interest from government. Ed Miliband  the energy minister of this country  was invited to come to our recent conference as a keynote listener. Which he did    and has since become a great advocate of the whole idea. There are now two local authorities in this country who have declared themselves transitional local authorities  Leicestershire and Somerset. And in Stroud  the transition group there  in effect  wrote the local government's food plan. And the head of the council said   If we didn't have Transition Stroud  we would have to invent all of that community infrastructure for the first time.  As we see the spread of it  we see national hubs emerging. In Scotland  the Scottish government's climate change fund has funded Transition Scotland as a national organization supporting the spread of this. And we see it all over the place as well now. But the key to transition is thinking not that we have to change everything now  but that things are already inevitably changing  and what we need to do is to work creatively with that  based on asking the right questions. I think I'd like to just return at the end to the idea of stories. Because I think stories are vital here. And actually the stories that we tell ourselves  we have a huge dearth of stories about how to move forward creatively from here. And one of the key things that transition does is to pull those stories out of what people are doing. Stories about the community that's produced its own    pound note  for example  the school that's turned its car park into a food garden  the community that's founded its own energy company. And for me  one of the great stories recently was the Obamas digging up the south lawn of the White House to create a vegetable garden. Because the last time that was done  when Eleanor Roosevelt did it  it led to the creation of    million vegetable gardens across the United States. So the question I'd like to leave you with  really  is    for all aspects of the things that your community needs in order to thrive  how can it be done in such a way that drastically reduces its carbon emissions  while also building resilience  Personally  I feel enormously grateful to have lived through the age of cheap oil. I've been astonishingly lucky  we've been astonishingly lucky. But let us honor what it has bought us  and move forward from this point. Because if we cling to it  and continue to assume that it can underpin our choices  the future that it presents to us is one which is really unmanageable. And by loving and leaving all that oil has done for us  and that the Oil Age has done for us  we are able to then begin the creation of a world which is more resilient  more nourishing  and in which  we find ourselves fitter  more skilled and more connected to each other. Thank you very much. It's a bit funny to be at a conference dedicated to things not seen  and present my proposal to build a       kilometer long wall across the entire African continent. About the size of the Great Wall of China  this would hardly be an invisible structure. And yet it's made from parts that are invisible  or near invisible  to the naked eye  bacteria and grains of sand. Now  as architects we're trained to solve problems. But I don't really believe in architectural problems  I only believe in opportunities. Which is why I'll show you a threat  and an architectural response. The threat is desertification. My response is a sandstone wall made from bacteria and solidified sand  stretching across the desert. Now  sand is a magical material of beautiful contradictions. It is simple and complex. It is peaceful and violent. It is always the same  never the same  endlessly fascinating. One billion grains of sand come into existence in the world each second. That's a cyclical process. As rocks and mountains die  grains of sand are born. Some of those grains may then cement naturally into sandstone. And as the sandstone weathers  new grains break free. Some of those grains may then accumulate on a massive scale  into a sand dune. In a way  the static  stone mountain becomes a moving mountain of sand. But  moving mountains can be dangerous. Let me try and explain why. Dry areas cover more than one third of the Earth's land surfaces. Some are already deserts  others are being seriously degraded by the sand. Just south of the Sahara we find the Sahel. The name means  edge of the desert.  And this is the region most closely associated with desertification. It was here in the late '  s and early '  s that major droughts brought three million people to become dependent upon emergency food aid  with about up to         dying. This is a catastrophe waiting to happen again. And it's one that gets very little attention. In our accelerated media culture  desertification is simply too slow to reach the headlines. It's nothing like a tsunami or a Katrina  too few crying children and smashed up houses. And yet desertification is a major threat on all continents  affecting some     countries and about    percent of the world's agricultural drylands. It seriously threatens the livelihoods of millions of people  and especially in Africa and China. And it is largely an issue that we've created for ourselves through unsustainable use of scarce resources. So  we get climate change. We get droughts  increased desertification  crashing food systems  water scarcity  famine  forced migration  political instability  warfare  crisis. That's a potential scenario if we fail to take this seriously. But  how far away is it  I went to Sokoto in northern Nigeria to try and find out how far away it is. The dunes here move southward at a pace of around     meters a year. That's the Sahara eating up almost  two meters  a day of the arable land  physically pushing people away from their homes. Here I am    I'm the second person on the left    with the elders in Gidan Kara  a tiny village outside of Sokoto. They had to move this village in      as a huge dune threatened to swallow it. So  they moved the entire village  hut by hut. This is where the village used to be. It took us about    minutes to climb up to the top of that dune  which goes to show why they had to move to a safer location. That's the kind of forced migration that desertification can lead to. If you happen to live close to the desert border  you can pretty much calculate how long it will be before you have to carry your kids away  and abandon your home and your life as you know it. Now  sand dunes cover only about one fifth of our deserts. And still  those extreme environments are very good places if we want to stop the shifting sands. Four years ago     African countries came together to create the Great Green Wall Sahara. A fantastic project  the initial plan called for a shelter belt of trees to be planted right across the African continent  from Mauritania in the west  all the way to Djibouti in the east. If you want to stop a sand dune from moving  what you need to make sure to do is to stop the grains from avalanching over its crest. And a good way of doing that  the most efficient way  is to use some kind of sand catcher. Trees or cacti are good for this. But  one of the problems with planting trees is that the people in these regions are so poor that they chop them down for firewood. Now there is an alternative to just planting trees and hoping that they won't get chopped down. This sandstone wall that I'm proposing essentially does three things. It adds roughness to the dune's surface  to the texture of the dune's surface  binding the grains. It provides a physical support structure for the trees  and it creates physical spaces  habitable spaces inside of the sand dunes. If people live inside of the green barrier they can help support the trees  protect them from humans  and from some of the forces of nature. Inside of the dunes we find shade. We can start harvesting condensation  and start greening the desert from within. Sand dunes are almost like ready made buildings in a way. All we need to do is solidify the parts that we need to be solid  and then excavate the sand  and we have our architecture. We can either excavate it by hand or we can have the wind excavate it for us. So  the wind carries the sand onto the site and then it carries the redundant sand away from the structure for us. But  by now  you're probably asking  how am I planning to solidify a sand dune  How do we glue those grains of sand together  And the answer is  perhaps  that you use these guys  Bacillus pasteurii  a micro organism that is readily available in wetlands and marshes  and does precisely that. It takes a pile of loose sand and it creates sandstone out of it. These images from the American Society for Microbiology show us the process. What happens is  you pour Bacillus pasteurii onto a pile of sand  and it starts filling up the voids in between the grains. A chemical process produces calcite  which is a kind of natural cement that binds the grains together. The whole cementation process takes about    hours. I learned about this from a professor at U.C. Davis called Jason DeJong. He managed to do it in a mere       minutes. Here I am  playing the part of the mad scientist  working with the bugs at UCL in London  trying to solidify them. So  how much would this cost  I'm not an economist  very much not  but I did  quite literally  a back of the envelope calculation       and it seems that for a cubic meter of concrete we would have to pay in the region of    dollars. And  after an initial cost of    bucks to buy the bacteria  which you'll never have to pay again  one cubic meter of bacterial sand would be about    dollars. How do we construct something like this  Well  I'll quickly show you two options. The first is to create a kind of balloon structure  fill it with bacteria  then allow the sand to wash over the balloon  pop the balloon  as it were  disseminating the bacteria into the sand and solidifying it. Then  a few years afterwards  using permacultural strategies  we green that part of the desert. The second alternative would be to use injection piles. So  we pushed the piles down through the dune  and we create an initial bacterial surface. We then pull the piles up through the dune and we're able to create almost any conceivable shape inside of the sand with the sand acting as a mold as we go up. So  we have a way of turning sand into sandstone  and then creating these habitable spaces inside of the desert dunes. But  what should they look like  Well  I was inspired  for my architectural form  by tafoni  which look a little bit like this  this is a model representation of it. These are cavernous rock structures that I found on the site in Sokoto. And I realized that if I scaled them up  they would provide me with good spatial qualities  for ventilation  for thermal comfort  and for other things. Now  part of the formal control over this structure would be lost to nature  obviously  as the bacteria do their work. And I think this creates a kind of boundless beauty actually. I think there is really something in that articulation that is quite nice. We see the result  the traces  if you like  of the Bacillus pasteurii being harnessed to sculpt the desert into these habitable environments. Some people believe that this would spread uncontrollably  and that the bacteria would kill everything in its way. That's not true at all. It's a natural process. It goes on in nature today  and the bacteria die as soon as we stop feeding them. So  there it is    architectural anti desertification structures made from the desert itself. Sand stopping devices  made from sand. The world is likely to lose one third of its arable land by the end of the century. In a period of unprecedented population growth and increased food demands  this could prove disastrous. And quite frankly  we're putting our heads in the sand. If nothing else  I would like for this scheme to initiate a discussion. But  if I had something like a TED wish  it would be to actually get it built  to start building this habitable wall  this very  very long  but very narrow city in the desert  built into the dunescape itself. It's not only something that supports trees  but something that connects people and countries together. I would like to conclude by showing you an animation of the structure  and leave you with a sentence by Jorge Luis Borges. Borges said that  nothing is built on stone  everything is built on sand  but we must build as if the sand were stone.  Now  there are many details left to explore in this scheme    political  practical  ethical  financial. My design  as it takes you down the rabbit hole  is fraught with many challenges and difficulties in the real world. But  it's a beginning  it's a vision. As Borges would have it  it's the sand. And I think now is really the time to turn it into stone. Thank you. One day a one eyed monkey came into the forest. Under a tree she saw a woman meditating furiously. The one eyed monkey recognized the woman  a Sekhri. She was the wife of an even more famous Brahmin. To watch her better  the one eyed monkey climbed onto the tree. Just then  with a loud bang  the heavens opened.  Claps  And the god Indra jumped into the clearing. Indra saw the woman  a Sekhri. Ah hah. The woman paid him no heed. So  Indra  attracted  threw her onto the floor  and proceeded to rape her. Then Indra disappeared.  Clap  Clap   And the woman's husband  the Brahmin  appeared. He realized at once what had happened. So  he petitioned the higher gods so that he may have justice. So  the god Vishnu arrived.  Are there any witnesses    Just a one eyed monkey   said the Brahmin. Now  the one eyed monkey really wanted for the woman  a Sekhri  to get justice  so she retold events exactly as they had happened. Vishnu gave his judgment.  The god Indra has sinned  in that he has sinned against ... a Brahmin. May he be called to wash away his sins.  So  Indra arrived  and performed the sacrifice of the horse. And so it transpired that a horse was killed  a god was made sin free  a Brahmin's ego was appeased  a woman ... was ruined  and a one eyed monkey was left ... very confused at what we humans call justice. In India there is a rape every three minutes. In India  only    percent of rapes come to a police station  and of these    percent that come to a police station  convictions are only in four percent of the cases. That's a lot of women who don't get justice. And it's not only about women. Look around you  look at your own countries. There is a certain pattern in who gets charged with crimes. If you're in Australia  it's mostly aboriginals who are in jail. If you're in India  it's either Muslims or Adivasis  our tribals  the Naxalites. If you're in the U.S.  it's mostly the blacks. There is a trend here. And the Brahmins and the gods  like in my story  always get to tell their truth as The Truth. So  have we all become one eyed    two eyed instead of one eyed    monkeys  Have we stopped seeing injustice  Good morning. You know  I have told this story close to     times  in audiences in    countries  to school students  to black tie dinners at the Smithsonian  and so on and so forth  and every time it hits something. Now  if I were to go into the same crowd and say   I want to lecture you about justice and injustice   they would say   Thank you very much  we have other things to do.  And that is the astonishing power of art. Art can go through where other things can't. You can't have barriers  because it breaks through your prejudices  breaks through everything that you have as your mask  that says   I am this  I am that  I am that.  No. It breaks through those. And it reaches somewhere where other things don't. And in a world where attitudes are so difficult to change  we need a language that reaches through. Hitler knew it  he used Wagner to make all the Nazis feel wonderful and Aryan. And Mr. Berlusconi knows it  as he sits atop this huge empire of media and television and so on and so forth. And all of the wonderful creative minds who are in all the advertising agencies  and who help corporate sell us things we absolutely don't require  they also know the power of the arts. For me it came very early. When I was a young child  my mother  who was a choreographer  came upon a phenomenon that worried her. It was a phenomenon where young brides were committing suicide in rural Gujarat  because they were being forced to bring more and more money for their in laws' families. And she created a dance piece which then Prime Minister Nehru saw. He came to talk to her and said   What is this about   She told him and he set out the first inquiry into what today we call Dowry Dance. Imagine a dance piece for the first inquiry into something that even today kills thousands of women. Many years later  when I was working with the director Peter Brook in  The Mahabharata  playing this feisty feminine feminist called Draupadi  I had similar experiences. Big fat black mamas in the Bronx used to come and say   Hey girl  that's it   And then these trendy young things in the Sorbonne would say   Madame Draupadi  on n'est pas feministe  mais  a   a   And then aboriginal women in Africa would come and say   This is it   And I thought   This is what we need  as a language.  We had somebody from public health. And Devdutt also mentioned public health. Well  millions of people around the world die of waterborne disease every year. And that's because there is no clean water to drink  or in countries like India  people don't know that they need to soap their hands before defecation. So  what do they do  They drink the water they know is dirty  they get cholera  they get diarrhea  they get jaundice and they die. And governments have not been able to provide clean water. They try and build it. They try and build pipelines  it doesn't happen. And the MNCs give them machines that they cannot afford. So what do you do  Do you let them die  Well  somebody had a great idea. And it was a simple idea. It was an idea that could not profit anybody but would help health in every field. Most houses in Asia and India have a cotton garment. And it was discovered  and WHO endorses this  that a clean cotton garment folded eight times over  can reduce bacteria up to    percent from water sieved through. So  why aren't governments blaring this on television  Why isn't it on every poster across the third world  Because there is no profit in it. Because nobody can get a kickback. But it still needs to get to people. And here is one of the ways we get it to people.  Video  Woman  Then get me one of those fancy water purifiers. Man  You know how expensive those are. I have a solution that requires neither machine  nor wood  nor cooking gas. Woman  What solution  Man  Listen  go fetch that cotton sari you have. Boy  Grand dad  tell me the solution please. Man  I will tell all of you. Just wait. Woman  Here father.  Man  Is it clean   Woman  Yes  of course. Man  Then do as I tell you. Fold the sari into eight folds. Woman  All right  father. Man  And you  you count that she does it right.  Boy  All right  grand dad.  Man  One  two  three  four folds we make. All the germs from the water we take. Chorus  One  two  three  four folds we make. All the germs from the water we take. Five  six  seven  eight folds we make. Our drinking water safe we make. Five  six  seven  eight folds we make. Our drinking water safe we make. Woman  Here  father  your eight times folded cotton sari. Man  So this is the cotton sari. And through this we will have clean water. I think it's safe to say that all of us here are deeply concerned about the escalating violence in our daily lives. While universities are trying to devise courses in conflict resolution  and governments are trying to stop skirmishes at borders  we are surrounded by violence  whether it's road rage  or whether it's domestic violence  whether it's a teacher beating up a student and killing her because she hasn't done her homework  it's everywhere. So  why are we not doing something to actually attend that problem on a day to day basis  What are we doing to try and make children and young people realize that violence is something that we indulge in  that we can stop  and that there are other ways of actually taking violence  taking anger  taking frustrations into different things that do not harm other people. Well  here is one such way. Your parents were peaceful people. Your grandparents were peaceful people. So much peace in one place  How could it be otherwise  But  what if ... Yes. What if ... One little gene in you has been trying to get through  From your beginnings in Africa  through each generation  may be passed on to you  in your creation. It's a secret urge  hiding deep in you. And if it's in you  then it's in me too. Oh  dear. It's what made you smack your baby brother  stamp on a cockroach  scratch your mother. It's the feeling that wells up from deep inside  when your husband comes home drunk and you wanna tan his hide. Want to kill that cyclist on the way to work  and string up your cousin 'cause she's such a jerk. Oh  dear. And as for outsiders  white  black or brown  tar and feather them  and whip them out of town. It's that little gene. It's small and it's mean. Too small for detection  it's your built in protection. Adrenaline  kill. It'll give you the will. Yes  you'd better face it 'cause you can't displace it. You're V I O L E N T. Cause you're either a victim  or on top  like me. Goodbye  Abraham Lincoln. Goodbye  Mahatma Gandhi. Goodbye  Martin Luther King. Hello  gangs from this neighborhood killing gangs from that neighborhood. Hello governments of rich countries selling arms to governments of poor countries who can't even afford to give them food. Hello civilization. Hello    st century. Look what we've ... look what they've done. Mainstream art  cinema  has been used across the world to talk about social issues. A few years ago we had a film called Rang De Basanti  which suddenly spawned thousands of young people wanting to volunteer for social change. In Venezuela  one of the most popular soap operas has a heroine called Crystal. And when  onscreen  Crystal got breast cancer         more young women went to have mammographies done. And of course   The Vagina Monologues  we know about. And there are stand up comics who are talking about racial issues  about ethnic issues. So  why is it  that if we think that we all agree that we need a better world  we need a more just world  why is it that we are not using the one language that has consistently showed us that we can break down barriers  that we can reach people  What I need to say to the planners of the world  the governments  the strategists is   You have treated the arts as the cherry on the cake. It needs to be the yeast.  Because  any future planning  if      is when we want to get there  unless the arts are put with the scientists  with the economists  with all those who prepare for the future  badly  we're not going to get there. And unless this is actually internalized  it won't happen. So  what is it that we require  What is it that we need  We need to break down our vision of what planners are  of what the correct way of a path is. And to say all these years of trying to make a better world  and we have failed. There are more people being raped. There are more wars. There are more people dying of simple things. So  something has got to give. And that is what I want. Can I have my last audio track please  Once there was a princess who whistled beautifully. Her father the king said   Don't whistle.  Her mother the queen said   Hai  don't whistle.  But the princess continued whistling. The years went by and the princess grew up into a beautiful young woman  who whistled even more beautifully. Her father the king said   Who will marry a whistling princess   Her mother the queen said   Who will marry a whistling princess   But the king had an idea. He announced a Swayamvara. He invited all the princes to come and defeat his daughter at whistling.  Whoever defeats my daughter shall have half my kingdom and her hand in marriage   Soon the palace filled with princes whistling. Some whistled badly. Some whistled well. But nobody could defeat the princess.  Now what shall we do   said the king.  Now what shall we do   said the queen. But the princess said   Father  Mother  don't worry. I have an idea. I am going to go to each of these young men and I am going to ask them if they defeated correctly. And if somebody answers  that shall be my wish.  So she went up to each and said   Do you accept that I have defeated you   And they said   Me  Defeated by a woman  No way  that's impossible  No no no no no  That's not possible.  Till finally one prince said   Princess  I accept  you have defeated me.   Uh huh ...  she said.  Father  mother  this man shall be my wife.  Thank you. As an Indian  and now as a politician and a government minister  I've become rather concerned about the hype we're hearing about our own country  all this talk about India becoming a world leader  even the next superpower. In fact  the American publishers of my book   The Elephant  The Tiger and the Cell Phone   added a gratuitous subtitle saying   India  The next   st century power.  And I just don't think that's what India's all about  or should be all about. Indeed  what worries me is the entire notion of world leadership seems to me terribly archaic. It's redolent of James Bond movies and Kipling ballads. After all  what constitutes a world leader  If it's population  we're on course to top the charts. We will overtake China by     . Is it military strength  Well  we have the world's fourth largest army. Is it nuclear capacity  We know we have that. The Americans have even recognized it  in an agreement. Is it the economy  Well  we have now the fifth largest economy in the world in purchasing power parity terms. And we continue to grow. When the rest of the world took a beating last year  we grew at  .  percent. But  somehow  none of that adds up to me  to what I think India really can aim to contribute in the world  in this part of the   st century. And so I wondered  could what the future beckons for India to be all about be a combination of these things allied to something else  the power of example  the attraction of India's culture  what  in other words  people like to call  soft power.  Soft power is a concept invented by a Harvard academic  Joseph Nye  a friend of mine. And  very simply  and I'm really cutting it short because of the time limits here  it's essentially the ability of a country to attract others because of its culture  its political values  its foreign policies. And  you know  lots of countries do this. He was writing initially about the States  but we know the Alliance Francaise is all about French soft power  the British Council. The Beijing Olympics were an exercise in Chinese soft power. Americans have the Voice of America and the Fulbright scholarships. But  the fact is  in fact  that probably Hollywood and MTV and McDonalds have done more for American soft power around the world than any specifically government activity. So soft power is something that really emerges partly because of governments  but partly despite governments. And in the information era we all live in today  what we might call the TED age  I'd say that countries are increasingly being judged by a global public that's been fed on an incessant diet of Internet news  of televised images  of cellphone videos  of email gossip. In other words  all sorts of communication devices are telling us the stories of countries  whether or not the countries concerned want people to hear those stories. Now  in this age  again  countries with access to multiple channels of communication and information have a particular advantage. And of course they have more influence  sometimes  about how they're seen. India has more all news TV channels than any country in the world  in fact in most of the countries in this part of the world put together. But  the fact still is that it's not just that. In order to have soft power  you have to be connected. One might argue that India has become an astonishingly connected country. I think you've already heard the figures. We've been selling    million cellphones a month. Currently there are     million cellphones in Indian hands  in India. And that makes us larger than the U.S. as a telephone market. In fact  those    million cellphones are the most connections that any country  including the U.S. and China  has ever established in the history of telecommunications. But  what perhaps some of you don't realize is how far we've come to get there. You know  when I grew up in India  telephones were a rarity. In fact  they were so rare that elected members of Parliament had the right to allocate    telephone lines as a favor to those they deemed worthy. If you were lucky enough to be a wealthy businessman or an influential journalist  or a doctor or something  you might have a telephone. But sometimes it just sat there. I went to high school in Calcutta. And we would look at this instrument sitting in the front foyer. But half the time we would pick it up with an expectant look on our faces  there would be no dial tone. If there was a dial tone and you dialed a number  the odds were two in three you wouldn't get the number you were intending to reach. In fact the words  wrong number  were more popular than the word  Hello.  If you then wanted to connect to another city  let's say from Calcutta you wanted to call Delhi  you'd have to book something called a trunk call  and then sit by the phone all day  waiting for it to come through. Or you could pay eight times the going rate for something called a lightning call. But  lightning struck rather slowly in our country in those days  so  it was like about a half an hour for a lightning call to come through. In fact  so woeful was our telephone service that a Member of Parliament stood up in      and complained about this. And the Then Communications Minister replied in a lordly manner that in a developing country communications are a luxury  not a right  that the government had no obligation to provide better service  and if the honorable Member wasn't satisfied with his telephone  could he please return it  since there was an eight year long waiting list for telephones in India. Now  fast forward to today and this is what you see  the    million cell phones a month. But what is most striking is who is carrying those cell phones. You know  if you visit friends in the suburbs of Delhi  on the side streets you will find a fellow with a cart that looks like it was designed in the   th century  wielding a coal fired steam iron that might have been invented in the   th century. He's called an isthri wala. But he's carrying a   st century instrument. He's carrying a cell phone because most incoming calls are free  and that's how he gets orders from the neighborhood  to know where to collect clothes to get them ironed. The other day I was in Kerala  my home state  at the country farm of a friend  about    kilometers away from any place you'd consider urban. And it was a hot day and he said   Hey  would you like some fresh coconut water   And it's the best thing and the most nutritious and refreshing thing you can drink on a hot day in the tropics  so I said sure. And he whipped out his cellphone  dialed the number  and a voice said   I'm up here.  And right on top of the nearest coconut tree  with a hatchet in one hand and a cell phone in the other  was a local toddy tapper  who proceeded to bring down the coconuts for us to drink. Fishermen are going out to sea and carrying their cell phones. When they catch the fish they call all the market towns along the coast to find out where they get the best possible prices. Farmers now  who used to have to spend half a day of backbreaking labor to find out if the market town was open  if the market was on  whether the product they'd harvested could be sold  what price they'd fetch. They'd often send an eight year old boy all the way on this trudge to the market town to get that information and come back  then they'd load the cart. Today they're saving half a day's labor with a two minute phone call. So this empowerment of the underclass is the real result of India being connected. And that transformation is part of where India is heading today. But  of course that's not the only thing about India that's spreading. You've got Bollywood. My attitude to Bollywood is best summarized in the tale of the two goats at a Bollywood garbage dump    Mr. Shekhar Kapur  forgive me    and they're chewing away on cans of celluloid discarded by a Bollywood studio. And the first goat  chewing away  says   You know  this film is not bad.  And the second goat says   No  the book was better.  I usually tend to think that the book is usually better  but  having said that  the fact is that Bollywood is now taking a certain aspect of Indian ness and Indian culture around the globe  not just in the Indian diaspora in the U.S. and the U.K.  but to the screens of Arabs and Africans  of Senegalese and Syrians. I've met a young man in New York whose illiterate mother in a village in Senegal takes a bus once a month to the capital city of Dakar  just to watch a Bollywood movie. She can't understand the dialogue. She's illiterate  so she can't read the French subtitles. But these movies are made to be understood despite such handicaps  and she has a great time in the song and the dance and the action. She goes away with stars in her eyes about India  as a result. And this is happening more and more. Afghanistan  we know what a serious security problem Afghanistan is for so many of us in the world. India doesn't have a military mission there. You know what was India's biggest asset in Afghanistan in the last seven years  One simple fact  you couldn't try to call an Afghan at      in the evening. Why  Because that was the moment when the Indian television soap opera   Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi   dubbed into Dari  was telecast on Tolo T.V. And it was the most popular television show in Afghan history. Every Afghan family wanted to watch it. They had to suspend functions at     . Weddings were reported to be interrupted so guests could cluster around the T.V. set  and then turn their attention back to the bride and groom. Crime went up at     . I have read a Reuters dispatch    so this is not Indian propaganda  a British news agency    about how robbers in the town of Musarri Sharif  stripped a vehicle of its windshield wipers  its hubcaps  its sideview mirrors  any moving part they could find  at       because the watchmen were busy watching the T.V. rather than minding the store. And they scrawled on the windshield in a reference to the show's heroine   Tulsi Zindabad    Long live Tulsi.  That's soft power. And that is what India is developing through the  E  part of TED  its own entertainment industry. The same is true  of course    we don't have time for too many more examples    but it's true of our music  of our dance  of our art  yoga  ayurveda  even Indian cuisine. I mean  the proliferation of Indian restaurants since I first went abroad as a student  in the mid '  s  and what I see today  you can't go to a mid size town in Europe or North America and not find an Indian restaurant. It may not be a very good one. But  today in Britain  for example  Indian restaurants in Britain employ more people than the coal mining  ship building and iron and steel industries combined. So the empire can strike back. But  with this increasing awareness of India  with you and with I  and so on  with tales like Afghanistan  comes something vital in the information era  the sense that in today's world it's not the side of the bigger army that wins  it's the country that tells a better story that prevails. And India is  and must remain  in my view  the land of the better story. Stereotypes are changing. I mean  again  having gone to the U.S. as a student in the mid '  s  I knew what the image of India was then  if there was an image at all. Today  people in Silicon Valley and elsewhere speak of the IITs  the Indian Institutes of Technology with the same reverence they used to accord to MIT. This can sometimes have unintended consequences. OK. I had a friend  a history major like me  who was accosted at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam  by an anxiously perspiring European saying   You're Indian  you're Indian  Can you help me fix my laptop   We've gone from the image of India as land of fakirs lying on beds of nails  and snake charmers with the Indian rope trick  to the image of India as a land of mathematical geniuses  computer wizards  software gurus. But that too is transforming the Indian story around the world. But  there is something more substantive to that. The story rests on a fundamental platform of political pluralism. It's a civilizational story to begin with. Because India has been an open society for millennia. India gave refuge to the Jews  fleeing the destruction of the first temple by the Babylonians  and said thereafter by the Romans. In fact  legend has is that when Doubting Thomas  the Apostle  Saint Thomas  landed on the shores of Kerala  my home state  somewhere around    A.D.  he was welcomed on shore by a flute playing Jewish girl. And to this day remains the only Jewish diaspora in the history of the Jewish people  which has never encountered a single incident of anti semitism. That's the Indian story. Islam came peacefully to the south  slightly more differently complicated history in the north. But all of these religions have found a place and a welcome home in India. You know  we just celebrated  this year  our general elections  the biggest exercise in democratic franchise in human history. And the next one will be even bigger  because our voting population keeps growing by    million a year. But  the fact is that the last elections  five years ago  gave the world extraordinary phenomenon of an election being won by a woman political leader of Italian origin and Roman Catholic faith  Sonia Gandhi  who then made way for a Sikh  Mohan Singh  to be sworn in as Prime Minister by a Muslim  President Abdul Kalam  in a country    percent Hindu. This is India  and of course it's all the more striking because it was four years later that we all applauded the U.S.  the oldest democracy in the modern world  more than     years of free and fair elections  which took till last year to elect a president or a vice president who wasn't white  male or Christian. So  maybe    oh sorry  he is Christian  I beg your pardon    and he is male  but he isn't white. All the others have been all those three. All his predecessors have been all those three  and that's the point I was trying to make. But  the issue is that when I talked about that example  it's not just about talking about India  it's not propaganda. Because ultimately  that electoral outcome had nothing to do with the rest of the world. It was essentially India being itself. And ultimately  it seems to me  that always works better than propaganda. Governments aren't very good at telling stories. But people see a society for what it is  and that  it seems to me  is what ultimately will make a difference in today's information era  in today's TED age. So India now is no longer the nationalism of ethnicity or language or religion  because we have every ethnicity known to mankind  practically  we've every religion know to mankind  with the possible exception of Shintoism  though that has some Hindu elements somewhere. We have    official languages that are recognized in our Constitution. And those of you who cashed your money here might be surprised to see how many scripts there are on the rupee note  spelling out the denominations. We've got all of that. We don't even have geography uniting us  because the natural geography of the subcontinent framed by the mountains and the sea was hacked by the partition with Pakistan in     . In fact  you can't even take the name of the country for granted  because the name  India  comes from the river Indus  which flows in Pakistan. But  the whole point is that India is the nationalism of an idea. It's the idea of an ever ever land  emerging from an ancient civilization  united by a shared history  but sustained  above all  by pluralist democracy. That is a   st century story as well as an ancient one. And it's the nationalism of an idea that essentially says you can endure differences of caste  creed  color  culture  cuisine  custom and costume  consonant  for that matter  and still rally around a consensus. And the consensus is of a very simple principle  that in a diverse plural democracy like India you don't really have to agree on everything all the time  so long as you agree on the ground rules of how you will disagree. The great success story of India  a country that so many learned scholars and journalists assumed would disintegrate  in the '  s and '  s  is that it managed to maintain consensus on how to survive without consensus. Now  that is the India that is emerging into the   st century. And I do want to make the point that if there is anything worth celebrating about India  it isn't military muscle  economic power. All of that is necessary  but we still have huge amounts of problems to overcome. Somebody said we are super poor  and we are also super power. We can't really be both of those. We have to overcome our poverty. We have to deal with the hardware of development  the ports  the roads  the airports  all the infrastructural things we need to do  and the software of development  the human capital  the need for the ordinary person in India to be able to have a couple of square meals a day  to be able to send his or her children to a decent school  and to aspire to work a job that will give them opportunities in their lives that can transform themselves. But  it's all taking place  this great adventure of conquering those challenges  those real challenges which none of us can pretend don't exist. But  it's all taking place in an open society  in a rich and diverse and plural civilization  in one that is determined to liberate and fulfill the creative energies of its people. That's why India belongs at TED  and that's why TED belongs in India. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Thank you so much  Prime Minister  that was both fascinating and quite inspiring. So  you're calling for a global ethic. Would you describe that as global citizenship  Is that an idea that you believe in  and how would you define that  Gordon Brown  It is about global citizenship and recognizing our responsibilities to others. There is so much to do over the next few years that is obvious to so many of us to build a better world. And there is so much shared sense of what we need to do  that it is vital that we all come together. But we don't necessarily have the means to do so. So there are challenges to be met. I believe the concept of global citizenship will simply grow out of people talking to each other across continents. But of course the task is to create the institutions that make that global society work. But I don't think we should underestimate the extent to which massive changes in technology make possible the linking up of people across the world. CA  But people get excited about this idea of global citizenship  but then they get confused a bit again when they start thinking about patriotism  and how to combine these two. I mean  you're elected as Prime Minister with a brief to bat for Britain. How do you reconcile the two things  GB  Well  of course national identity remains important. But it's not at the expense of people accepting their global responsibilities. And I think one of the problems of recession is that people become more protectionist  they look in on themselves  they try to protect their own nation  perhaps at the expense of other nations. When you actually look at the motor of the world economy  it cannot move forward unless there is trade between the different countries. And any nation that would become protectionist over the next few years would deprive itself of the chance of getting the benefits of growth in the world economy. So  you've got to have a healthy sense of patriotism  that's absolutely important. But you've got to realize that this world has changed fundamentally  and the problems we have cannot be solved by one nation and one nation alone. CA  Well  indeed. But what do you do when the two come into conflict and you're forced to make a decision that either is in Britain's interest  or the interest of Britons  or citizens elsewhere in the world  GB  Well I think we can persuade people that what is necessary for Britain's long term interests  what is necessary for America's long term interests  is proper engagement with the rest of the world  and taking the action that is necessary. There is a great story  again  told about Richard Nixon.       Ghana becomes independent  so it is just over    years ago. Richard Nixon goes to represent the United States government at the celebrations for independence in Ghana. And it's one of his first outings as Vice President to an African country. He doesn't quite know what to do  so he starts going around the crowd and starts talking to people and he says to people in this rather unique way   How does it feel to be free   And he's going around   How does it feel to be free    How does it feel to be free   And then someone says   How should I know  I come from Alabama.  And that was the     s. Now  what is remarkable is that civil rights in America were achieved in the     s. But what is equally remarkable is socioeconomic rights in Africa have not moved forward very fast even since the age of colonialism. And yet  America and Africa have got a common interest. And we have got to realize that if we don't link up with those people who are sensible voices and democratic voices in Africa  to work together for common causes  then the danger of Al Qaeda and related groups making progress in Africa is very big. So  I would say that what seems sometimes to be altruism  in relation to Africa  or in relation to developing countries  is more than that. It is enlightened self interest for us to work with other countries. And I would say that national interest and  if you like  what is the global interest to tackle poverty and climate change do  in the long run  come together. And whatever the short run price for taking action on climate change or on security  or taking action to provide opportunities for people for education  these are prices that are worth paying so that you build a stronger global society where people feel able to feel comfortable with each other and are able to communicate with each other in such a way that you can actually build stronger links between different countries. CA  I still just want to draw out on this issue. So  you're on vacation at a nice beach  and word comes through that there's been a massive earthquake and that there is a tsunami advancing on the beach. One end of the beach  there is a house containing a family of five Nigerians. And at the other end of the beach there is a single Brit. You have time to    you have time to alert one house. What do you do  GB  Modern communications. Alert both. I do agree that my responsibility is first of all to make sure that people in our country are safe. And I wouldn't like anything that is said today to suggest that I am diminishing the importance of the responsibility that each leader has for their own country. But I'm trying to suggest that there is a huge opportunity open to us that was never open to us before. But the power to communicate across borders allows us to organize the world in a different way. And I think  look at the tsunami  it's a classic example. Where was the early warning systems  Where was the world acting together to deal with the problems that they knew arose from the potential for earthquakes  as well as the potential for climate change  And when the world starts to work together  with better early warning systems  you can deal with some of these problems in a better way. I just think we're not seeing  at the moment  the huge opportunities open to us by the ability of people to cooperate in a world where either there was isolationism before or there was limited alliances based on convenience which never actually took you to deal with some of the central problems. CA  But I think this is the frustration that perhaps a lot of people have  like people in the audience here  where we love the kind of language that you're talking about. It is inspiring. A lot of us believe that that has to be the world's future. And yet  when the situation changes  you suddenly hear politicians talking as if  you know  for example  the life of one American soldier is worth countless numbers of Iraqi civilians. When the pedal hits the metal  the idealism can get moved away. I'm just wondering whether you can see that changing over time  whether you see in Britain that there are changing attitudes  and that people are actually more supportive of the kind of global ethic that you talk about. GB  I think every religion  every faith  and I'm not just talking here to people of faith or religion    it has this global ethic at the center of its credo. And whether it's Jewish or whether it's Muslim or whether it's Hindu  or whether it's Sikh  the same global ethic is at the heart of each of these religions. So  I think you're dealing with something that people instinctively see as part of their moral sense. So you're building on something that is not pure self interest. You're building on people's ideas and values    that perhaps they're candles that burn very dimly on certain occasions. But it is a set of values that cannot  in my view  be extinguished. Then the question is  how do you make that change happen  How do you persuade people that it is in their interest to build strong    After the Second World War  we built institutions  the United Nations  the IMF  the World Bank  the World Trade Organization  the Marshall Plan. There was a period in which people talked about an act of creation  because these institutions were so new. But they are now out of date. They don't deal with the problems. You can't deal with the environmental problem through existing institutions. You can't deal with the security problem in the way that you need to. You can't deal with the economic and financial problem. So we have got to rebuild our global institutions  build them in a way that is suitable to the challenges of this time. And I believe that if you look at the biggest challenge we face  it is to persuade people to have the confidence that we can build a truly global society with the institutions that are founded on these rules. So  I come back to my initial point. Sometimes you think things are impossible. Nobody would have said    years ago that apartheid would have gone in       or that the Berlin wall would have fallen at the turn of the '  s and '  s  or that polio could be eradicated  or perhaps    years ago  nobody would have said a man could gone to the Moon. All these things have happened. By tackling the impossible  you make the impossible possible. CA  And we have had a speaker who said that very thing  and swallowed a sword right after that  which was quite dramatic. GB  Followed my sword and swallow. CA  But  surely a true global ethic is for someone to say   I believe that the life of every human on the planet is worth the same  equal consideration  regardless of nationality and religion.  And you have politicians who have    you're elected. In a way  you can't say that. Even if  as a human being  you believe that  you can't say that. You're elected for Britain's interests. GB  We have a responsibility to protect. I mean look        the Treaty of Versailles  and all the treaties before that  the Treaty of Westphalia and everything else  were about protecting the sovereign right of countries to do what they want. Since then  the world has moved forward  partly as a result of what happened with the Holocaust  and people's concern about the rights of individuals within territories where they need protection  partly because of what we saw in Rwanda  partly because of what we saw in Bosnia. The idea of the responsibility to protect all individuals who are in situations where they are at humanitarian risk is now being established as a principle which governs the world. So  while I can't automatically say that Britain will rush to the aid of any citizen of any country  in danger  I can say that Britain is in a position where we're working with other countries so that this idea that you have a responsibility to protect people who are victims of either genocide or humanitarian attack  is something that is accepted by the whole world. Now  in the end  that can only be achieved if your international institutions work well enough to be able to do so. And that comes back to what the future role of the United Nations  and what it can do  actually is. But  the responsibility to protect is a new idea that is  in a sense  taken over from the idea of self determination as the principle governing the international community. CA  Can you picture  in our lifetimes  a politician ever going out on a platform of the kind of full form global ethic  global citizenship  And basically saying   I believe that all people across the planet have equal consideration  and if in power we will act in that way. And we believe that the people of this country are also now global citizens and will support that ethic.  GB  Is that not what we're doing in the debate about climate change  We're saying that you cannot solve the problem of climate change in one country  you've got to involve all countries. You're saying that you must  and you have a duty to help those countries that cannot afford to deal with the problems of climate change themselves. You're saying you want a deal with all the different countries of the world where we're all bound together to cutting carbon emissions in a way that is to the benefit of the whole world. We've never had this before because Kyoto didn't work. If you could get a deal at Copenhagen  where people agreed  A  that there was a long term target for carbon emission cuts  B  that there was short range targets that had to be met so this wasn't just abstract  it was people actually making decisions now that would make a difference now  and if you could then find a financing mechanism that meant that the poorest countries that had been hurt by our inability to deal with climate change over many  many years and decades are given special help so that they can move to energy efficient technologies  and they are in a position financially to be able to afford the long term investment that is associated with cutting carbon emissions  then you are treating the world equally  by giving consideration to every part of the planet and the needs they have. It doesn't mean that everybody does exactly the same thing  because we've actually got to do more financially to help the poorest countries  but it does mean there is equal consideration for the needs of citizens in a single planet. CA  Yes. And then of course the theory is still that those talks get rent apart by different countries fighting over their own individual interests. GB  Yes  but I think Europe has got a position  which is    countries have already come together. I mean  the great difficulty in Europe is if you're at a meeting and    people speak  it takes a very  very long time. But we did get an agreement on climate change. America has made its first disposition on this with the bill that President Obama should be congratulated for getting through Congress. Japan has made an announcement. China and India have signed up to the scientific evidence. And now we've got to move them to accept a long term target  and then short term targets. But more progress has been made  I think  in the last few weeks than had been made for some years. And I do believe that there is a strong possibility that if we work together  we can get that agreement to Copenhagen. I certainly have been putting forward proposals that would have allowed the poorest parts of the world to feel that we have taken into account their specific needs. And we would help them adapt. And we would help them make the transition to a low carbon economy. I do think a reform of the international institutions is vital to this. When the IMF was created in the     s  it was created with resources that were five percent or so of the world's GDP. The IMF now has limited resources  one percent. It can't really make the difference that ought to be made in a period of crisis. So  we've got to rebuild the world institutions. And that's a big task  persuading all the different countries with the different voting shares in these institutions to do so. There is a story told about the three world leaders of the day getting a chance to get some advice from God. And the story is told that Bill Clinton went to God and he asked when there will be successful climate change and a low carbon economy. And God shook his head and said   Not this year  not this decade  perhaps not even in  your  lifetime.  And Bill Clinton walked away in tears because he had failed to get what he wanted. And then the story is that Barroso  the president of the European Commission  went to God and he asked   When will we get a recovery of global growth   And God said   Not this year  not in this decade  perhaps not in your lifetime.  So Barroso walked away crying and in tears. And then the Secretary General of the United Nations came up to speak to God and said   When will our international institutions work   And God cried. It is very important to recognize that this reform of institutions is the next stage after agreeing upon ourselves that there is a clear ethic upon which we can build. CA  Prime Minister  I think there are many in the audience who are truly appreciative of the efforts you made in terms of the financial mess we got ourselves into. And there are certainly many people in the audience who will be cheering you on as you seek to advance this global ethic. Thank you so much for coming to TED. GB  Well  thank you. How do you observe something you can't see  This is the basic question of somebody who's interested in finding and studying black holes. Because black holes are objects whose pull of gravity is so intense that nothing can escape it  not even light  so you can't see it directly. So  my story today about black holes is about one particular black hole. I'm interested in finding whether or not there is a really massive  what we like to call  supermassive  black hole at the center of our galaxy. And the reason this is interesting is that it gives us an opportunity to prove whether or not these exotic objects really exist. And second  it gives us the opportunity to understand how these supermassive black holes interact with their environment  and to understand how they affect the formation and evolution of the galaxies which they reside in. So  to begin with  we need to understand what a black hole is so we can understand the proof of a black hole. So  what is a black hole  Well  in many ways a black hole is an incredibly simple object  because there are only three characteristics that you can describe  the mass  the spin  and the charge. And I'm going to only talk about the mass. So  in that sense  it's a very simple object. But in another sense  it's an incredibly complicated object that we need relatively exotic physics to describe  and in some sense represents the breakdown of our physical understanding of the universe. But today  the way I want you to understand a black hole  for the proof of a black hole  is to think of it as an object whose mass is confined to zero volume. So  despite the fact that I'm going to talk to you about an object that's supermassive  and I'm going to get to what that really means in a moment  it has no finite size. So  this is a little tricky. But fortunately there is a finite size that you can see  and that's known as the Schwarzschild radius. And that's named after the guy who recognized why it was such an important radius. This is a virtual radius  not reality  the black hole has no size. So why is it so important  It's important because it tells us that any object can become a black hole. That means you  your neighbor  your cellphone  the auditorium can become a black hole if you can figure out how to compress it down to the size of the Schwarzschild radius. At that point  what's going to happen  At that point gravity wins. Gravity wins over all other known forces. And the object is forced to continue to collapse to an infinitely small object. And then it's a black hole. So  if I were to compress the Earth down to the size of a sugar cube  it would become a black hole  because the size of a sugar cube is its Schwarzschild radius. Now  the key here is to figure out what that Schwarzschild radius is. And it turns out that it's actually pretty simple to figure out. It depends only on the mass of the object. Bigger objects have bigger Schwarzschild radii. Smaller objects have smaller Schwarzschild radii. So  if I were to take the sun and compress it down to the scale of the University of Oxford  it would become a black hole. So  now we know what a Schwarzschild radius is. And it's actually quite a useful concept  because it tells us not only when a black hole will form  but it also gives us the key elements for the proof of a black hole. I only need two things. I need to understand the mass of the object I'm claiming is a black hole  and what its Schwarzschild radius is. And since the mass determines the Schwarzschild radius  there is actually only one thing I really need to know. So  my job in convincing you that there is a black hole is to show that there is some object that's confined to within its Schwarzschild radius. And your job today is to be skeptical. Okay  so  I'm going to talk about no ordinary black hole  I'm going to talk about supermassive black holes. So  I wanted to say a few words about what an ordinary black hole is  as if there could be such a thing as an ordinary black hole. An ordinary black hole is thought to be the end state of a really massive star's life. So  if a star starts its life off with much more mass than the mass of the Sun  it's going to end its life by exploding and leaving behind these beautiful supernova remnants that we see here. And inside that supernova remnant is going to be a little black hole that has a mass roughly three times the mass of the Sun. On an astronomical scale that's a very small black hole. Now  what I want to talk about are the supermassive black holes. And the supermassive black holes are thought to reside at the center of galaxies. And this beautiful picture taken with the Hubble Space Telescope shows you that galaxies come in all shapes and sizes. There are big ones. There are little ones. Almost every object in that picture there is a galaxy. And there is a very nice spiral up in the upper left. And there are a hundred billion stars in that galaxy  just to give you a sense of scale. And all the light that we see from a typical galaxy  which is the kind of galaxies that we're seeing here  comes from the light from the stars. So  we see the galaxy because of the star light. Now  there are a few relatively exotic galaxies. I like to call these the prima donna of the galaxy world  because they are kind of show offs. And we call them active galactic nuclei. And we call them that because their nucleus  or their center  are very active. So  at the center there  that's actually where most of the starlight comes out from. And yet  what we actually see is light that can't be explained by the starlight. It's way more energetic. In fact  in a few examples it's like the ones that we're seeing here. There are also jets emanating out from the center. Again  a source of energy that's very difficult to explain if you just think that galaxies are composed of stars. So  what people have thought is that perhaps there are supermassive black holes which matter is falling on to. So  you can't see the black hole itself  but you can convert the gravitational energy of the black hole into the light we see. So  there is the thought that maybe supermassive black holes exist at the center of galaxies. But it's a kind of indirect argument. Nonetheless  it's given rise to the notion that maybe it's not just these prima donnas that have these supermassive black holes  but rather all galaxies might harbor these supermassive black holes at their centers. And if that's the case    and this is an example of a normal galaxy  what we see is the star light. And if there is a supermassive black hole  what we need to assume is that it's a black hole on a diet. Because that is the way to suppress the energetic phenomena that we see in active galactic nuclei. If we're going to look for these stealth black holes at the center of galaxies  the best place to look is in our own galaxy  our Milky Way. And this is a wide field picture taken of the center of the Milky Way. And what we see is a line of stars. And that is because we live in a galaxy which has a flattened  disk like structure. And we live in the middle of it  so when we look towards the center  we see this plane which defines the plane of the galaxy  or line that defines the plane of the galaxy. Now  the advantage of studying our own galaxy is it's simply the closest example of the center of a galaxy that we're ever going to have  because the next closest galaxy is     times further away. So  we can see far more detail in our galaxy than anyplace else. And as you'll see in a moment  the ability to see detail is key to this experiment. So  how do astronomers prove that there is a lot of mass inside a small volume  Which is the job that I have to show you today. And the tool that we use is to watch the way stars orbit the black hole. Stars will orbit the black hole in the very same way that planets orbit the sun. It's the gravitational pull that makes these things orbit. If there were no massive objects these things would go flying off  or at least go at a much slower rate because all that determines how they go around is how much mass is inside its orbit. So  this is great  because remember my job is to show there is a lot of mass inside a small volume. So  if I know how fast it goes around  I know the mass. And if I know the scale of the orbit I know the radius. So  I want to see the stars that are as close to the center of the galaxy as possible. Because I want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible. So  this means that I want to see a lot of detail. And that's the reason that for this experiment we've used the world's largest telescope. This is the Keck observatory. It hosts two telescopes with a mirror    meters  which is roughly the diameter of a tennis court. Now  this is wonderful  because the campaign promise of large telescopes is that is that the bigger the telescope  the smaller the detail that we can see. But it turns out these telescopes  or any telescope on the ground has had a little bit of a challenge living up to this campaign promise. And that is because of the atmosphere. Atmosphere is great for us  it allows us to survive here on Earth. But it's relatively challenging for astronomers who want to look through the atmosphere to astronomical sources. So  to give you a sense of what this is like  it's actually like looking at a pebble at the bottom of a stream. Looking at the pebble on the bottom of the stream  the stream is continuously moving and turbulent  and that makes it very difficult to see the pebble on the bottom of the stream. Very much in the same way  it's very difficult to see astronomical sources  because of the atmosphere that's continuously moving by. So  I've spent a lot of my career working on ways to correct for the atmosphere  to give us a cleaner view. And that buys us about a factor of   . And I think all of you can agree that if you can figure out how to improve life by a factor of     you've probably improved your lifestyle by a lot  say your salary  you'd notice  or your kids  you'd notice. And this animation here shows you one example of the techniques that we use  called adaptive optics. You're seeing an animation that goes between an example of what you would see if you don't use this technique    in other words  just a picture that shows the stars    and the box is centered on the center of the galaxy  where we think the black hole is. So  without this technology you can't see the stars. With this technology all of a sudden you can see it. This technology works by introducing a mirror into the telescope optics system that's continuously changing to counteract what the atmosphere is doing to you. So  it's kind of like very fancy eyeglasses for your telescope. Now  in the next few slides I'm just going to focus on that little square there. So  we're only going to look at the stars inside that small square  although we've looked at all of them. So  I want to see how these things have moved. And over the course of this experiment  these stars have moved a tremendous amount. So  we've been doing this experiment for    years  and we see the stars go all the way around. Now  most astronomers have a favorite star  and mine today is a star that's labeled up there  SO  . Absolutely my favorite star in the world. And that's because it goes around in only    years. And to give you a sense of how short that is  the sun takes     million years to go around the center of the galaxy. Stars that we knew about before  that were as close to the center of the galaxy as possible  take     years. And this one  this one goes around in a human lifetime. That's kind of profound  in a way. But it's the key to this experiment. The orbit tells me how much mass is inside a very small radius. So  next we see a picture here that shows you before this experiment the size to which we could confine the mass of the center of the galaxy. What we knew before is that there was four million times the mass of the sun inside that circle. And as you can see  there was a lot of other stuff inside that circle. You can see a lot of stars. So  there was actually lots of alternatives to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy  because you could put a lot of stuff in there. But with this experiment  we've confined that same mass to a much smaller volume that's        times smaller. And because of that  we've been able to show that there is a supermassive black hole there. To give you a sense of how small that size is  that's the size of our solar system. So  we're cramming four million times the mass of the sun into that small volume. Now  truth in advertising. Right  I have told you my job is to get it down to the Schwarzchild radius. And the truth is  I'm not quite there. But we actually have no alternative today to explaining this concentration of mass. And  in fact  it's the best evidence we have to date for not only existence of a supermassive black hole at the center of our own galaxy  but any in our universe. So  what next  I actually think this is about as good as we're going to do with today's technology  so let's move on with the problem. So  what I want to tell you  very briefly  is a few examples of the excitement of what we can do today at the center of the galaxy  now that we know that there is  or at least we believe  that there is a supermassive black hole there. And the fun phase of this experiment is  while we've tested some of our ideas about the consequences of a supermassive black hole being at the center of our galaxy  almost every single one has been inconsistent with what we actually see. And that's the fun. So  let me give you the two examples. You can ask   What do you expect for the old stars  stars that have been around the center of the galaxy for a long time  they've had plenty of time to interact with the black hole.  What you expect there is that old stars should be very clustered around the black hole. You should see a lot of old stars next to that black hole. Likewise  for the young stars  or in contrast  the young stars  they just should not be there. A black hole does not make a kind neighbor to a stellar nursery. To get a star to form  you need a big ball of gas and dust to collapse. And it's a very fragile entity. And what does the big black hole do  It strips that gas cloud apart. It pulls much stronger on one side than the other and the cloud is stripped apart. In fact  we anticipated that star formation shouldn't proceed in that environment. So  you shouldn't see young stars. So  what do we see  Using observations that are not the ones I've shown you today  we can actually figure out which ones are old and which ones are young. The old ones are red. The young ones are blue. And the yellow ones  we don't know yet. So  you can already see the surprise. There is a dearth of old stars. There is an abundance of young stars  so it's the exact opposite of the prediction. So  this is the fun part. And in fact  today  this is what we're trying to figure out  this mystery of how do you get    how do you resolve this contradiction. So  in fact  my graduate students are  at this very moment  today  at the telescope  in Hawaii  making observations to get us hopefully to the next stage  where we can address this question of why are there so many young stars  and so few old stars. To make further progress we really need to look at the orbits of stars that are much further away. To do that we'll probably need much more sophisticated technology than we have today. Because  in truth  while I said we're correcting for the Earth's atmosphere  we actually only correct for half the errors that are introduced. We do this by shooting a laser up into the atmosphere  and what we think we can do is if we shine a few more that we can correct the rest. So this is what we hope to do in the next few years. And on a much longer time scale  what we hope to do is build even larger telescopes  because  remember  bigger is better in astronomy. So  we want to build a    meter telescope. And with this telescope we should be able to see stars that are even closer to the center of the galaxy. And we hope to be able to test some of Einstein's theories of general relativity  some ideas in cosmology about how galaxies form. So  we think the future of this experiment is quite exciting. So  in conclusion  I'm going to show you an animation that basically shows you how these orbits have been moving  in three dimensions. And I hope  if nothing else  I've convinced you that  one  we do in fact have a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy. And this means that these things do exist in our universe  and we have to contend with this  we have to explain how you can get these objects in our physical world. Second  we've been able to look at that interaction of how supermassive black holes interact  and understand  maybe  the role in which they play in shaping what galaxies are  and how they work. And last but not least  none of this would have happened without the advent of the tremendous progress that's been made on the technology front. And we think that this is a field that is moving incredibly fast  and holds a lot in store for the future. Thanks very much. For emotions  we should not move quickly to the desert. So  first  a small housekeeping announcement  please switch off your proper English check programs installed in your brain. So  welcome to the Golden Desert  Indian desert. It receives the least rainfall in the country  lowest rainfall. If you are well versed with inches  nine inches  centimeters      centimeters . The groundwater is     feet deep      meters. And in most parts it is saline  not fit for drinking. So  you can't install hand pumps or dig wells  though there is no electricity in most of the villages. But suppose you use the green technology  solar pumps    they are of no use in this area. So  welcome to the Golden Desert. Clouds seldom visit this area. But we find    different names of clouds in this dialect used here. There are a number of techniques to harvest rain. This is a new work  it's a new program. But for the desert society this is no program  this is their life. And they harvest rain in many ways. So  this is the first device they use in harvesting rain. It's called kunds  somewhere it is called  unclear . And you can notice they have created a kind of false catchment. The desert is there  sand dunes  some small field. And this is all big raised platform. You can notice the small holes the water will fall on this catchment  and there is a slope. Sometimes our engineers and architects do not care about slopes in bathrooms  but here they will care properly. And the water will go where it should go. And then it is    feet deep. The waterproofing is done perfectly  better than our city contractors  because not a single drop should go waste in this. They collect     thousand liters in one season. And this is pure drinking water. Below the surface there is hard saline water. But now you can have this for year round. It's two houses. We often use a term called bylaws. Because we are used to get written things. But here it is unwritten by law. And people made their house  and the water storage tanks. These raised up platforms just like this stage. In fact they go    feet deep  and collect rain water from roof  there is a small pipe  and from their courtyard. It can also harvest something like        in a good monsoon. Another big one  this is of course out of the hardcore desert area. This is near Jaipur. This is called the Jaigarh Fort. And it can collect six million gallons of rainwater in one season. The age is     years. So  since     years it has been giving you almost six million gallons of water per season. You can calculate the price of that water. It draws water from    kilometers of canals. You can see a modern road  hardly    years old. It can break sometimes. But this     year old canal  which draws water  it is maintained for so many generations. Of course if you want to go inside  the two doors are locked. But they can be opened for TED people. And we request them. You can see person coming up with two canisters of water. And the water level    these are not empty canisters    water level is right up to this. It can envy many municipalities  the color  the taste  the purity of this water. And this is what they call Zero B type of water  because it comes from the clouds  pure distilled water. We stop for a quick commercial break  and then we come back to the traditional systems. The government thought that this is a very backward area and we should bring a multi million dollar project to bring water from the Himalayas. That's why I said that this is a commercial break. But we will come back  once again  to the traditional thing. So  water from          kilometers away  soon it become like this. In many portions  water hyacinth covered these big canals like anything. Of course there are some areas where water is reaching  I'm not saying that it is not reaching at all. But the tail end  the Jaisalmer area  you will notice in Bikaner things like this  where the water hyacinth couldn't grow  the sand is flowing in these canals. The bonus is that you can find wildlife around it. We had full page advertisements  some    years     years ago when this canal came. They said that throw away your traditional systems  these new cement tanks will supply you piped water. It's a dream. And it became a dream also. Because soon the water was not able to reach these areas. And people started renovating their own structures. These are all traditional water structures  which we won't be able to explain in such a short time. But you can see that no woman is standing on those. And they are plaiting hair. Jaisalmer. This is heart of desert. This town was established     years ago. I'm not sure by that time Bombay was there  or Delhi was there  or Chennai was there  or Bangalore was there. So  this was the terminal point for silk route. Well connected      years ago  through Europe. None of us were able to go to Europe  but Jaisalmer was well connected to it. And this is the    centimeter area. Such a limited rainfall  and highest colorful life flourished in these areas. You won't find water in this slide. But it is invisible. Somewhere a stream or a rivulet is running through here. Or  if you want to paint  you can paint it blue throughout because every roof which you see in this picture collects rainwater drops and deposit in the rooms. But apart from this system  they designed    beautiful water bodies around this town. And what we call private public partnership you can add estate also. So  estate  public and private entrepreneurs work together to build this beautiful water body. And it's a kind of water body for all seasons. You will admire it. Just behold the beauty throughout the year. Whether water level goes up or down  the beauty is there throughout. Another water body  dried up  of course  during the summer period  but you can see how the traditional society combines engineering with aesthetics  with the heart. These statues  marvelous statues  gives you an idea of water table. When this rain comes and the water starts filling this tank  it will submerge these beautiful statues in what we call in English today  mass communication.  This was for mass communication. Everybody in the town will know that this elephant has drowned  so water will be there for seven months or nine months  or    months. And then they will come and worship this pond  pay respect  their gratitude. Another small water body  called the  unclear . It is difficult to translate in English  especially in my English. But the nearest would be  glory   a reputation. The reputation in desert of this small water body is that it never dries up. In severe drought periods nobody has seen this water body getting dried up. And perhaps they knew the future also. It was designed some     years ago. But perhaps they knew that on sixth  November        there will be a TED green and blue session  so they painted it like this. Dry water body. Children are standing on a very difficult device to explain. This is called kund. We have  in English  surface water and ground water. But this is not ground water. You can draw ground water from any well. But this is no ordinary well. It squeeze the moisture hidden in the sand. And they have dubbed this water as the third one called  unclear . And there is a gypsum belt running below it. And it was deposited by the great mother Earth  some three million years ago. And where we have this gypsum strip they can harvest this water. This is the same dry water body. Now  you don't find any kund  they are all submerged. But when the water goes down they will be able to draw water from those structures throughout the year. This year they have received only six centimeters. Six centimeter of rainfall  and they can telephone you that if you find any water problem in your city  Delhi  Bombay  Bangalore  Mysore  please come to our area of six centimeters  we can give you water. How they maintain them  There are three things  concept  planning  making the actual thing  and also maintaining them. It is a structure for maintain  for centuries  by generations  without any department  without any funding  So the secret is   unclear    respect. Your own thing  not personal property  my property  every time. So  these stone pillars will remind you that you are entering into a water body area. Don't spit  don't do anything wrong  so that the clean water can be collected. Another pillar  stone pillar on your right side. If you climb these three  six steps you will find something very nice. This was done in   th century. And you have to go further down. They say that a picture is worth a thousand words  so we can say a thousand words right now  an another thousand words. If the water table goes down  you will find new stairs. If it comes up  some of them will be submerged. So  throughout the year this beautiful system will give you some pleasure. Three sides  such steps  on the fourth side there is a four story building where you can organize such TED conferences anytime. Excuse me  who built these structures  They are in front of you. The best civil engineers we had  the best planners  the best architects. We can say that because of them  because of their forefathers  India could get the first engineering college in     . There were no English medium schools at that time  even no Hindi schools   unclear  schools. But such people  compelled to the East India Company  which came here for business  a very dirty kind of business ... but not to create the engineering colleges. But because of them  first engineering college was created in a small village  not in the town. The last point  we all know in our primary schools that that camel is a ship of desert. So  you can find through your Jeep  a camel  and a cart. This tire comes from the airplane. So  look at the beauty from the desert society who can harvest rainwater  and also create something through a tire from a jet plane  and used in a camel cart. Last picture  it's a tattoo        years old tattoo. They were using it on their body. Tattoo was  at one time  a kind of a blacklisted or con thing  but now it is in thing. You can copy this tattoo. I have some posters of this. The center of life is water. These are the beautiful waves. These are the beautiful stairs which we just saw in one of the slides. These are the trees. And these are the flowers which add fragrance to our lives. So  this is the message of desert. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  So  first of all  I wish I had your eloquence  truly  in any language. These artifacts and designs are inspiring. Do you believe that they can be used elsewhere  that the world can learn from this  Or is this just right for this place  Anupam Mishra  No  the basic idea is to utilize water that falls on our area. So  the ponds  the open bodies  are everywhere  right from Sri Lanka to Kashmir  and in other parts also. And these  unclear   which stored water  there are two type of things. One recharge  and one stores. So  it depends on the terrain. But kund  which uses the gypsum belt  for that you have to go back to your calendar  three million years ago. If it is there it can be done right now. Otherwise  it can't be done. CA  Thank you so much. For the last    years I've been designing puzzles. And I'm here today to give you a little tour  starting from the very first puzzle I designed  through what I'm doing now. I've designed puzzles for books  printed things. I'm the puzzle columnist for Discover Magazine. I've been doing that for about    years. I have a monthly puzzle calendar. I do toys. The bulk of my work is in computer games. I did puzzles for  Bejeweled.  I didn't invent  Bejeweled.  I can't take credit for that. So  very first puzzle  sixth grade  my teacher said   Oh  let's see  that guy  he likes to make stuff. I'll have him cut out letters out of construction paper for the board.  I thought this was a great assignment. And so here is what I came up with. I start fiddling with it. I came up with this letter. This is a letter of the alphabet that's been folded just once. The question is  which letter is it if I unfold it  One hint  It's not  L.  It could be an  L   of course. So  what else could it be  Yeah  a lot of you got it. Oh yeah. So  clever thing. Now  that was my first puzzle. I got hooked. I created something new  I was very excited because  you know  I'd made crossword puzzles  but that's sort of like filling in somebody else's matrix. This was something really original. I got hooked. I read Martin Gardner's columns in Scientific American. Went on  and eventually decided to devote myself  full time  to that. Now  I should pause and say  what do I mean by puzzle  A puzzle is a problem that is fun to solve and has a right answer.  Fun to solve   as opposed to everyday problems  which  frankly  are not very well designed puzzles. You know  they might have a solution. It might take a long time. Nobody wrote down the rules clearly. Who designed this  It's like  you know  life is not a very well written story so we have to hire writers to make movies. Well  I take everyday problems  and I make puzzles out of them. And  right answer   of course there might be more than one right answer  many puzzles have more than one. But as opposed to a couple other forms of play  toys and games    by toy I mean  something you play with that doesn't have a particular goal. You can create one out of Legos. You know  you can do anything you want. Or competitive games like chess where  well  you're not trying to solve ... You can make a chess puzzle  but the goal really is to beat another player. I consider that puzzles are an art form. They're very ancient. It goes back as long as there is written history. It's a very small form  like a joke  a poem  a magic trick or a song  very compact form. At worst  they're throwaways  they're for amusement. But at best they can reach for something more and create a memorable impression. The progression of my career that you'll see is looking for creating puzzles that have a memorable impact. So  one thing I found early on  when I started doing computer games  is that I could create puzzles that will alter your perception. I'll show you how. Here is a famous one. So  it's two profiles in black  or a white vase in the middle. This is called a figure ground illusion. The artist M.C. Escher exploited that in some of his wonderful prints. Here we have  Day and Night.  Here is what I did with figure and ground. So  here we have  figure  in black. Here we have  figure  in white. And it's all part of the same design. The background to one is the other. Originally I tried to do the words  figure  and  ground.  But I couldn't do that  I realized. I changed the problem. It's all  figure.  A few other things. Here is my name. And that turns into the title of my first book   Inversions.  These sorts of designs now go by the word  ambigram.  I'll show you just a couple others. Here we have the numbers one through     the digits zero through nine  actually. Each letter here is one of these digits. Not strictly an ambigram in the conventional sense. I like pushing on what an ambigram can mean. Here's the word  mirror.  No  it's not the same upside down. It's the same this way. And a marvelous fellow from the Media Lab who just got appointed head of RISD  is John Maeda. And so I did this for him. It's sort of a visual canon. And recently in Magic magazine I've done a number of ambigrams on magician's names. So here we have Penn and Teller  same upside down. This appears in my puzzle calendar. Okay  let's go back to the slides. Thank you very much. Now  those are fun to look at. Now how would you do it interactively  For a while I was an interface designer. And so I think a lot about interaction. Well  let's first of all simplify the vases illusion  make the thing on the right. Now  if you could pick up the black vase  it would look like the figure on top. If you could pick up the white area  it would look like the figure on the bottom. Well  you can't do that physically  but on a computer you can do it. Let's switch over to the P.C. And here it is  figure ground. The goal here is to take the pieces on the left and make them so they look like the shape on the right. And this follows the rules I just said  any black area that is surrounded by white can be picked up. But that is also true of any white area. So  here we got the white area in the middle  and you can pick it up. I'll just go one step further. So  here is    here is a couple pieces. Move them together  and now this is an active piece. You can really get inside somebody's perception and have them experience something. It's like the old maxim of  you can tell somebody something and show them  but if they do it they really learn it.  Here is another thing you can do. There is a game called Rush Hour. This is one of the true masterpieces in puzzle design besides Rubik's cube. So  here we have a crowded parking lot with cars all over the place. The goal is to get the red car out. It's a sliding block puzzle. It's made by the company Think Fun. It's done very well. I love this puzzle. Well  let's play one. Here. So  here is a very simple puzzle. Well  that's too simple  let's add another piece. Okay  so how would you solve this one  Well  move the blue one out of the way. Here  let's make it a little harder. Still pretty easy. Now we'll make it harder  a little harder. Now  this one is a little bit trickier. You know  What do you do here  The first move is going to be what  You're going to move the blue one up in order to get the lavender one to the right. And you can make puzzles like this one that aren't solvable at all. Those four are locked in a pinwheel  you can't get them apart. I wanted to make a sequel. I didn't come up with the original idea. But this is another way I work as an inventor is to create a sequel. I came up with this. This is Railroad Rush Hour. It's the same basic game except I introduced a new piece  a square piece that can move both horizontally and vertically. In the other game the cars can only move forward and back. Created a whole bunch of levels for it. Now I'm making it available to schools. And it includes exercises that show you not just how to solve these puzzles  but how to extract the principles that will let you solve mathematical puzzles or problems in science  other areas. So  I'm really interested in you learning how to make your own puzzles as well as just me creating them. Garry Trudeau calls himself an investigative cartoonist. You know  he does a lot of research before he writes a cartoon. In Discover Magazine  I'm an investigative puzzle maker. I got interested in gene sequencing. And I said   Well  how on Earth can you come up with a sequence of the base pairs in DNA   Cut up the DNA  you sequence individual pieces  and then you look for overlaps  and you basically match them at the edges. And I said   This is kind of like a jigsaw puzzle  except the pieces overlap.  So  here is what I created for Discover Magazine. And it has to be solvable in a magazine. You know  you can't cut out the pieces and move them around. So  here is the nine pieces. And you're supposed to put them into this grid. And you have to choose pieces that overlap on the edge. There is only one solution. It's not that hard. But it takes some persistence. And when you're done  it makes this design  which  if you squint  is the word  helix.  So  that's the form of the puzzle coming out of the content  rather than the other way around. Here is a couple more. Here is a physics based puzzle. Which way will these fall  One of these weighs    pounds     pounds and    pounds. And depending on which one weighs which amount  they'll fall different directions. And here is a puzzle based on color mixing. I separated this image into cyan  magenta  yellow  black  the basic printing colors  and then mixed up the separations  and you get these peculiar pictures. Which separations were mixed up to make those pictures  Gets you thinking about color. Finally  what I'm doing now. So  ShuffleBrain.com  website you can go visit  I joined up with my wife  Amy Jo Kim. She could easily be up here giving a talk about her work. So  we're making smart games for social media. I'll explain what that means. We're looking at three trends. This is what's going on in the games industry right now. First of all  you know  for a long time computer games meant things like  Doom   where you're going around shooting things  very violent games  very fast  aimed at teenage boys. Right  That's who plays computer games. Well  guess what  That's changing.  Bejeweled  is a big hit. It was the game that really broke open what's called casual games. And the main players are over     and are female. Then recently  Rock Band  has been a big hit. And it's a game you play with other people. It's very physical. It looks nothing like a traditional game. This is what's becoming the dominant form of electronic gaming. Now  within that there is some interesting things happening. There is also a trend towards games that are good for you. Why  Well  we aging Boomers  Baby Boomers  we're eating our healthy food  we're exercising. What about our minds  Oh no  our parents are getting Alzheimer's. We better do something. Turns out doing crossword puzzles can stave off some of the effects of Alzheimer's. So  we got games like  Brain Age  coming out for the Nintendo DS  huge hit. A lot of people do Sudoku. In fact some doctors prescribe it. And then there is social media  and what's happening on the Internet. Everybody now considers themselves a creator  and not just a viewer. And what does this add up to  Here is what we see coming. It's games that fit into a healthy lifestyle. They're part of your life. They're not necessarily a separate thing. And they are both  something that is good for you  and they're fun. I'm a puzzle guy. My wife is an expert in social media. And we decided to combine our skills. Our first game is called  Photo Grab.  The game takes about a minute and    seconds. This is your first time playing my game. Okay. Let's see how well we can do. There are three images. And we have    seconds each. Where is that  I'll play as fast as I can. But if you can see it  shout out the answer. You get more    Down  okay  yeah where is that  Oh  yeah. There  okay. J O and    I guess that's that part. We got the bow. That bow helps. That's his hair. You get a lot of figure ground problems. Yeah  that one is easy. Okay. So  ahhh  Okay on to the next one. Okay  so that's the lens. Anybody  Looks like a black shape. So  where is that  That's the corner of the whole thing. Yeah  I've played this image before  but even when I make up my own puzzles    and you can put your own images in here. And we have people all over the world doing that now. There we are. Visit ShuffleBrain.com if you want to try it yourself. Thank you. I'm talking to you about the worst form of human rights violation  the third largest organized crime  a     billion industry. I'm talking to you about modern day slavery. I'd like to tell you the story of these three children  Pranitha  Shaheen and Anjali. Pranitha's mother was a woman in prostitution  a prostituted person. She got infected with HIV  and towards the end of her life  when she was in the final stages of AIDS  she could not prostitute  so she sold four year old Pranitha to a broker. By the time we got the information  we reached there  Pranitha was already raped by three men. Shaheen's background I don't even know. We found her in a railway track  raped by many  many men  I don't know many. But the indications of that on her body was that her intestine was outside her body. And when we took her to the hospital she needed    stitches to put back her intestine into her body. We still don't know who her parents are  who she is. All that we know that hundreds of men had used her brutally. Anjali's father  a drunkard  sold his child for pornography. You're seeing here images of three years  four year olds  and five year old children who have been trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation. In this country  and across the globe  hundreds and thousands of children  as young as three  as young as four  are sold into sexual slavery. But that's not the only purpose that human beings are sold for. They are sold in the name of adoption. They are sold in the name of organ trade. They are sold in the name of forced labor  camel jockeying  anything  everything. I work on the issue of commercial sexual exploitation. And I tell you stories from there. My own journey to work with these children started as a teenager. I was    when I was gang raped by eight men. I don't remember the rape part of it so much as much as the anger part of it. Yes  there were eight men who defiled me  raped me  but that didn't go into my consciousness. I never felt like a victim  then or now. But what lingered from then till now    I am    today    is this huge outrageous anger. Two years  I was ostracized  I was stigmatized  I was isolated  because I was a victim. And that's what we do to all traffic survivors. We  as a society  we have PhDs in victimizing a victim. Right from the age of     when I started looking around me  I started seeing hundreds and thousands of women and children who are left in sexual slavery like practices  but have absolutely no respite  because we don't allow them to come in. Where does their journey begin  Most of them come from very optionless families  not just poor. You have even the middle class sometimes getting trafficked. I had this I.S. officer's daughter  who is    years old  studying in ninth standard  who was raped chatting with one individual  and ran away from home because she wanted to become a heroine  who was trafficked. I have hundreds and thousands of stories of very very well to do families  and children from well to do families  who are getting trafficked. These people are deceived  forced.   .  percent of them resist being inducted into prostitution. Some pay the price for it. They're killed  we don't even hear about them. They are voiceless   unclear   nameless people. But the rest  who succumb into it  go through everyday torture. Because the men who come to them are not men who want to make you your girlfriends  or who want to have a family with you. These are men who buy you for an hour  for a day  and use you  throw you. Each of the girls that I have rescued    I have rescued more than       girls    each of them tell me one story in common ... one story about one man  at least  putting chili powder in her vagina  one man taking a cigarette and burning her  one man whipping her. We are living among those men  they're our brothers  fathers  uncles  cousins  all around us. And we are silent about them. We think it is easy money. We think it is shortcut. We think the person likes to do what she's doing. But the extra bonuses that she gets is various infections  sexually transmitted infections  HIV  AIDS  syphilis  gonorrhea  you name it  substance abuse  drugs  everything under the sun. And one day she gives up on you and me  because we have no options for her. And therefore she starts normalizing this exploitation. She believes   Yes  this is it  this is what my destiny is about.  And this is normal  to get raped by     men a day. And it's abnormal to live in a shelter. It's abnormal to get rehabilitated. It's in that context that I work. It's in that context that I rescue children. I've rescued children as young as three years  and I've rescued women as old as    years. When I rescued them  one of the biggest challenges I had was where do I begin. Because I had lots of them who were already HIV infected. One third of the people I rescue are HIV positive. And therefore my challenge was to understand how can I get out the power from this pain. And for me  I was my greatest experience. Understanding my own self  understanding my own pain  my own isolation  was my greatest teacher. Because what we did with these girls is to understand their potential. You see a girl here who is trained as a welder. She works for a very big company  a workshop in Hyderabad  making furnitures. She earns around        rupees. She is an illiterate girl  trained  skilled as a welder. Why welding and why not computers  We felt  one of the things that these girls had is immense amount of courage. They did not have any pardas inside their body  hijabs inside themselves  they've crossed the barrier of it. And therefore they could fight in a male dominated world  very easily  and not feel very shy about it. We have trained girls as carpenters  as masons  as security guards  as cab drivers. And each one of them are excelling in their chosen field  gaining confidence  restoring dignity  and building hopes in their own lives. These girls are also working in big construction companies like Ram ki construction  as masons  full time masons. What has been my challenge  My challenge has not been the traffickers who beat me up. I've been beaten up more than    times in my life. I can't hear from my right ear. I've lost a staff of mine who was murdered while on a rescue. My biggest challenge is society. It's you and me. My biggest challenge is your blocks to accept these victims as our own. A very supportive friend of mine  a well wisher of mine  used to give me every month        rupees for vegetables. When her mother fell sick she said   Sunitha  you have so much of contacts. Can you get somebody in my house to work  so that she can look after my mother   And there is a long pause. And then she says   Not one of our girls.  It's very fashionable to talk about human trafficking  in this fantastic A C hall. It's very nice for discussion  discourse  making films and everything. But it is not nice to bring them to our homes. It's not nice to give them employment in our factories  our companies. It's not nice for our children to study with their children. There it ends. That's my biggest challenge. If I'm here today  I'm here not only as Sunitha Krishnan. I'm here as a voice of the victims and survivors of human trafficking. They need your compassion. They need your empathy. They need  much more than anything else  your acceptance. Many times when I talk to people  I keep telling them one thing  don't tell me hundred ways how you cannot respond to this problem. Can you ply your mind for that one way that you can respond to the problem  And that's what I'm here for  asking for your support  demanding for your support  requesting for your support. Can you break your culture of silence  Can you speak to at least two persons about this story  Tell them this story. Convince them to tell the story to another two persons. I'm not asking you all to become Mahatma Gandhis or Martin Luther Kings  or Medha Patkars  or something like that. I'm asking you  in your limited world  can you open your minds  Can you open your hearts  Can you just encompass these people too  Because they are also a part of us. They are also part of this world. I'm asking you  for these children  whose faces you see  they're no more. They died of AIDS last year. I'm asking you to help them  accept as human beings    not as philanthropy  not as charity  but as human beings who deserve all our support. I'm asking you this because no child  no human being  deserves what these children have gone through. Thank you. Chris has been so nice. I don't know how you keep it up  Chris  I really don't. So nice  all week. He's the kind of man you could say to   Chris  I'm really sorry  I've crashed your car. And it gets worse  I crashed it into your house. Your house has caught fire. And what's more  your wife has just run off with your best friend.  And you know that Chris would say   Thank you.   Thank you for sharing  that's really interesting.   Thank you for taking me to a place that I didn't know existed. Thank you.  One of the     Applause  Thank you for inviting us. One of the things about appearing later on in the TED week is that  gradually  as the days go by  all the other speakers cover most of what you were going to say. Nuclear fusion  I had about    minutes on that. Spectroscopy  that was another one. Parallel universes. And so this morning I thought   Oh well  I'll just do a card trick.  That one's gone as well. And today is Emmanuel's day  I think we've agreed that  already  haven't we  Emmanuel  Absolutely.  Applause  I was planning on finishing on a dance ... So  that's going to look pretty shabby now. So  what I thought I'd do is    in honor of Emmanuel    is  what I can do is to launch today the first TED Global auction. If I could start  this is the Enigma decoding machine. Who will start me with         Anyone  Thank you. Bruno's face  just then  he said   No  don't go through this. Don't  please don't. Don't go through this. Don't do it.  I'm worried. When I first got the invitation  they said somewhere in the thing  they said      minutes to change the world  your moment onstage.     minutes to change the world. I don't know about you  it takes me    minutes to change a plug. So  the idea of changing the world is really quite an extraordinary one. Well  of course now we know we don't have to change a plug  now we've seen that wonderful demonstration of the wireless electric    fantastic. You know  it inspires us.     years ago he'd have been burnt at the stake for that. And now it's an idea. It's great. It's fantastic. But you do meet some fantastic people  people who look at the world in a totally different way. Yesterday  David Deutsch  another one who covered most of what I was going to say. But when you think of the world in that way  it does make going to Starbucks a whole new experience  don't you think  I mean  he must walk in and they will say   Would you like a macchiato  or a latte  or an Americano  or a cappuccino   And he'll say   You're offering me things that are infinitely variable.   How can your coffee be true   And they will say   Would you mind if I serve the next customer   And Elaine Morgan yesterday  wasn't she wonderful  Fantastic. Really good. Her talk about the aquatic ape  and the link  of course  the link between Darwinism and the fact that we are all naked beneath this    we're not hirsute and we can swim rather well. And she said  you know  she's   . She's running out of time  she said. And she's desperate to find more evidence for the link. And I think   I'm sitting next to Lewis Pugh.  This man has swum around the North Pole  what more evidence do you want  And there he is. That's how TED brings these connections together. I wasn't here on Tuesday. I didn't actually see Gordon Brown's job application    um  sorry. I'm so sorry.  Applause  I'm so sorry. No  no.  Applause  No  no  ahh ...  Applause  The problem I have is because Gordon Brown  he comes onstage and he looks for all the world like a man who's just taken the head off a bear suit. Uh  no.   Laughter   I'm sorry. I've only got    minutes     minutes to talk about saving the world  saving the planet  global institutions. Our work on climate change  I've only got    minutes  unfortunately I'm not able to tell you about all the wonderful things we're doing to promote the climate change agenda in Great Britain  like the third runway we're planning at Heathrow Airport ...   The large coal fired power station we're building at King's North  and of course the exciting news that only today  only this week  Britain's only manufacturer of wind turbines has been forced to close. No time  unfortunately  to mention those.   British jobs for Scottish people ... No.   Laughter   Christian principles  Christian values. Thou shalt not kill  thou shalt not steal  thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife.   Although to be honest  when I was at Number    that was never going to be a problem.  Alright Gordon  come on  eh. I just  can I just say a few things about  first about Cherie  because she's a wonderful lady  my wife  with a wonderful smile. That reminds me  I must post that letter.   I just think  you know  what people forget  Gordon and I  we always got on perfectly well. Alright  it was never exactly 'Brokeback Mountain.'   You know  I wrote to him  just before I left office. I said  'Can I rely on your support for the next month ' And he wrote back. He said  'No  you can't.' Which kind of surprised me  because I'd never seen 'can't' spelled that way before.  Another thing Gordon could have mentioned in his speech to the Mansion House in         that was to the building  the people weren't listening. But the people  when talking about the finance industry  he said   What you as the city of London have done for financial services  we  as a government  hope to do for the economy as a whole.  When you think what's happened to financial services  and you see what's happened to the economy  you think   Well  there is a man who delivers on his promises.  But we're in a new world now. We're in a completely new world. This is the first time that I can remember  where if you get a letter from the bank manager about a loan  you don't know if you're borrowing money from him  or if he's borrowing money from you. Am I right  These extraordinary things  Icelandic Internet accounts. Did anyone here have an Icelandic Internet account  Why would you do that  Why would    It's like one step up from replying to one of those emails from Nigeria  isn't it  Asking for your bank details. And  you know  Iceland  it was never going to cut it. It didn't have that kind of collateral. What does it have  It has fish  that's all. That's why the Prime Minister went on television. He said   This has left us all with a very big haddock.  A lot of what I do    I have to try and make sense of things before I can make nonsense of them. And making sense of the financial crisis is very  very difficult. Luckily  somebody like George Bush was really helpful. He summed it up  really  at a dinner. He was speaking at a dinner  he said   Wall Street got drunk.   And now it's got a hangover.  And that's  you know  that's something    And that's something we can relate to. It's certainly something he can relate to. And the other one  of course  is Donald Rumsfeld  who said   There are the known knowns  the things we know we know. And then you got the known unknowns  the things we know we don't know. And then you got the unknown unknowns  those are the things we don't know we don't know.  And being English  when I first heard that I thought   What a load of cock.  And then  you're now  well  actually  that's what this is about. This whole  what Ben Bernanke has said  the chaotic unwinding of the world's financial system  it's about    they don't know  they didn't know what they were doing. In       the head of the American Mortgage Bankers Association said  quote   As we can clearly see  no seismic occurrence is about to overwhelm the U.S. economy.  Now  there is a man on top of his job. And when the crisis was happening  the head of quantitative equities at Lehman Brothers said   Events which models predicted would happen once every        years happened every day for three days.  So  it's extraordinary. It's a new world that's very  very difficult to make sense of. But we have a new hope. We have a new man. America has now elected its first openly black President. Wonderful news. Not only that  he's left handed. Have you noticed this  How many people here are left handed  You see  a lot of the people that I most admire  they're great artists  great designers  great thinkers  they're left handed. And somebody said to me last night  you know  being left handed  you have to learn to write without smudging the ink. And somebody was talking about metaphors on Monday. And I thought  what a wonderful metaphor  isn't it  An American President who has to write without smudging the ink. You like that one  As opposed to you could see George Bush  well  what's the metaphor there  I think it would be something out of the aquatic ape thing  wouldn't it   Well  you know I'm sorry about that. I'm right handed but I seem to have smudged that ink as well.  But  you know  he's gone. Now he's gone. That's eight years of American History  eight minutes of my act  just gone like that.  You know  it's the end of an error  sic . I happen to believe it was a great error. I know folks said to me they believe it was one of the greatest errors in the history of the United States. But we proved them wrong in Iraq. They said there was no link between Iraq and Al Qaeda. There is now.   But I have a message for the suicide bombers  for those people who've blown themselves up.   We're going to find you.   We're going to make sure you don't do it again.  But now he's gone  and it's great to see one of the    arguably one of the worst speech makers in American history  now given way to one of the greatest  in Obama. You were there  maybe  on the night of his victory. And he spoke to the crowd in Chicago  he said   If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible ...  I can't do the whole thing because it would take too long  it really would. But you get the picture. And then it goes to the inauguration. And he and the Chief Justice  they trip over each other  they get their words wrong and they screw the thing up. And there is George Bush sitting there going   Heh heh heh heh ...   Not so easy is it  Heh heh heh.  But the interesting thing is  Gordon Brown was talking about Cicero  who said  people would listen to a speech  they said   Great speech.  And then they'd listen to Demosthenes  and they'd say   Let's march.  And we all want to believe in President Obama. It's rather like that line in the film  As Good As it Gets.  Do you remember that film with Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson  and Helen Hunt says to Jack Nicholson   What do you see in me   And Jack Nicholson just says   You make me want to be a better man.  And you want a leader who inspires and challenges and makes you want to be a better citizen. Right  But at the moment  it's a Cicero thing. We like what Barack Obama says  but we don't do anything about it. So he comes over to this country  and he says   We need a big fiscal stimulus.  And everyone goes   Great   He leaves the country and the French and the Germans go   No  no  forget about that  absolutely not.  Nothing happens. He goes to Strasburg. He says   We need more boots on the ground in Afghanistan.  And everyone goes   Great idea.  He leaves  people go   No no no  we're not going to do that.       maximum  and no rockets. No  no  not going to do it.  He goes to Prague  he says   We believe in a nuclear free world.  And it's great to have an American president who can say the word  nuclear   let's just point that out first. Do you remember that  George Bush   A nu ca ler.  Sorry  what   A nu ca ler.  Could you say  avuncular    Avunclear.  Thank you very much. But he says   We want a nuclear free world.  And that day  North Korea  that very day  North Korea is just seeing if it can just get one over Japan    and land it before ... So  where do we look for inspiration  We've still got Bill Clinton.  Travels the world.   Laughs   I believe  I believe it was President Dwight D. Eisenhower who said ...   Tell a lie  it was Diana Ross ...   ... who said  reach out and touch ...   ... somebody's gla    hand.   Make this world a better place  if you can. I just think that's important. I really do. And I was hoping Hillary would get to the White House  because she'd have been out of our home for four years. And I  you know.   Laughter   So  when that didn't work out I had to make a few arrangements  let me tell you.  So  there's him. In Britain we have Prince Charles   And the environment is so important  all we can do. My wife gets fed up with me constantly trying to push emissions up her agenda.  Or  any South Africans  we have Mandela to inspire. Mandela  the great man Mandela. He's been honored with a statue now. The previous highest honor he had in Britain was a visit from the team from Ground Force  a gardening program.  So  Nelson  how would you like a nice water feature    Ahh  listen to me Mr. Titchmarsh.   I was held in prison for nearly    years on an island in the middle of the ocean. Why would I need a bloody water feature   Very quickly  I wasn't quite sure how to end this talk and then yesterday that man came up with a wonderful quote from the  Japanese Essays on Idleness  which said it's nice to have something which is unfinished because it implies there is still room for growth. Thank you very much indeed. The National Portrait Gallery is the place dedicated to presenting great American lives  amazing people. And that's what it's about. We use portraiture as a way to deliver those lives  but that's it. And so I'm not going to talk about the painted portrait today. I'm going to talk about a program I started there  which  from my point of view  is the proudest thing I did. I started to worry about the fact that a lot of people don't get their portraits painted anymore  and they're amazing people  and we want to deliver them to future generations. So  how do we do that  And so I came up with the idea of the living self portrait series. And the living self portrait series was the idea of basically my being a brush in the hand of amazing people who would come and I would interview. And so what I'm going to do is  not so much give you the great hits of that program  as to give you this whole notion of how you encounter people in that kind of situation  what you try to find out about them  and when people deliver and when they don't and why. Now  I had two preconditions. One was that they be American. That's just because  in the nature of the National Portrait Gallery  it's created to look at American lives. That was easy  but then I made the decision  maybe arbitrary  that they needed to be people of a certain age  which at that point  when I created this program  seemed really old. Sixties  seventies  eighties and nineties. For obvious reasons  it doesn't seem that old anymore to me. And why did I do that  Well  for one thing  we're a youth obsessed culture. And I thought really what we need is an elders program to just sit at the feet of amazing people and hear them talk. But the second part of it    and the older I get  the more convinced I am that that's true. It's amazing what people will say when they know how the story turned out. That's the one advantage that older people have. Well  they have other  little bit of advantage  but they also have some disadvantages  but the one thing they or we have is that we've reached the point in life where we know how the story turned out. So  we can then go back in our lives  if we've got an interviewer who gets that  and begin to reflect on how we got there. All of those accidents that wound up creating the life narrative that we inherited. So  I thought okay  now  what is it going to take to make this work  There are many kinds of interviews. We know them. There are the journalist interviews  which are the interrogation that is expected. This is somewhat against resistance and caginess on the part of the interviewee. Then there's the celebrity interview  where it's more important who's asking the question than who answers. That's Barbara Walters and others like that  and we like that. That's Frost Nixon  where Frost seems to be as important as Nixon in that process. Fair enough. But I wanted interviews that were different. I wanted to be  as I later thought of it  empathic  which is to say  to feel what they wanted to say and to be an agent of their self revelation. By the way  this was always done in public. This was not an oral history program. This was all about     people sitting at the feet of this individual  and having me be the brush in their self portrait. Now  it turns out that I was pretty good at that. I didn't know it coming into it. And the only reason I really know that is because of one interview I did with Senator William Fulbright  and that was six months after he'd had a stroke. And he had never appeared in public since that point. This was not a devastating stroke  but it did affect his speaking and so forth. And I thought it was worth a chance  he thought it was worth a chance  and so we got up on the stage  and we had an hour conversation about his life  and after that a woman rushed up to me  essentially did  and she said   Where did you train as a doctor   And I said   I have no training as a doctor. I never claimed that.  And she said   Well  something very weird was happening. When he started a sentence  particularly in the early parts of the interview  and paused  you gave him the word  the bridge to get to the end of the sentence  and by the end of it  he was speaking complete sentences on his own.  I didn't know what was going on  but I was so part of the process of getting that out. So I thought  okay  fine  I've got empathy  or empathy  at any rate  is what's critical to this kind of interview. But then I began to think of other things. Who makes a great interview in this context  It had nothing to do with their intellect  the quality of their intellect. Some of them were very brilliant  some of them were  you know  ordinary people who would never claim to be intellectuals  but it was never about that. It was about their energy. It's energy that creates extraordinary interviews and extraordinary lives. I'm convinced of it. And it had nothing to do with the energy of being young. These were people through their   s. In fact  the first person I interviewed was George Abbott  who was     and Abbott was filled with the life force    I guess that's the way I think about it    filled with it. And so he filled the room  and we had an extraordinary conversation. He was supposed to be the toughest interview that anybody would ever do because he was famous for being silent  for never ever saying anything except maybe a word or two. And  in fact  he did wind up opening up    by the way  his energy is evidenced in other ways. He subsequently got married again at      so he  you know  he had a lot of the life force in him. But after the interview  I got a call  very gruff voice  from a woman. I didn't know who she was  and she said   Did you get George Abbott to talk   And I said   Yeah. Apparently I did.  And she said   I'm his old girlfriend  Maureen Stapleton  and I could never do it.  And then she made me go up with the tape of it and prove that George Abbott actually could talk. So  you know  you want energy  you want the life force  but you really want them also to think that they have a story worth sharing. The worst interviews that you can ever have are with people who are modest. Never ever get up on a stage with somebody who's modest  because all of these people have been assembled to listen to them  and they sit there and they say   Aw  shucks  it was an accident.  There's nothing that ever happens that justifies people taking good hours of the day to be with them. The worst interview I ever did  William L. Shirer. The journalist who did  The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.  This guy had met Hitler and Gandhi within six months  and every time I'd ask him about it  he'd say   Oh  I just happened to be there. Didn't matter.  Whatever. Awful. I never would ever agree to interview a modest person. They have to think that they did something and that they want to share it with you. But it comes down  in the end  to how do you get through all the barriers we have. All of us are public and private beings  and if all you're going to get from the interviewee is their public self  there's no point in it. It's pre programmed. It's infomercial  and we all have infomercials about our lives. We know the great lines  we know the great moments  we know what we're not going to share  and the point of this was not to embarrass anybody. This wasn't    and some of you will remember Mike Wallace's old interviews    tough  aggressive and so forth. They have their place. I was trying to get them to say what they probably wanted to say  to break out of their own cocoon of the public self  and the more public they had been  the more entrenched that person  that outer person was. And let me tell you at once the worse moment and the best moment that happened in this interview series. It all has to do with that shell that most of us have  and particularly certain people. There's an extraordinary woman named Clare Boothe Luce. It'll be your generational determinant as to whether her name means much to you. She did so much. She was a playwright. She did an extraordinary play called  The Women.  She was a congresswoman when there weren't very many congresswomen. She was editor of Vanity Fair  one of the great phenomenal women of her day. And  incidentally  I call her the Eleanor Roosevelt of the Right. She was sort of adored on the Right the way Eleanor Roosevelt was on the Left. And  in fact  when we did the interview    I did the living self portrait with her    there were three former directors of the CIA basically sitting at her feet  just enjoying her presence. And I thought  this is going to be a piece of cake  because I always have preliminary talks with these people for just maybe    or    minutes. We never talk before that because if you talk before  you don't get it on the stage. So she and I had a delightful conversation. We were on the stage and then    by the way  spectacular. It was all part of Clare Boothe Luce's look. She was in a great evening gown. She was     almost that day of the interview  and there she was and there I was  and I just proceeded into the questions. And she stonewalled me. It was unbelievable. Anything that I would ask  she would turn around  dismiss  and I was basically up there    any of you in the moderate to full entertainment world know what it is to die onstage. And I was dying. She was absolutely not giving me a thing. And I began to wonder what was going on  and you think while you talk  and basically  I thought  I got it. When we were alone  I was her audience. Now I'm her competitor for the audience. That's the problem here  and she's fighting me for that  and so then I asked her a question    I didn't know how I was going to get out of it    I asked her a question about her days as a playwright  and again  characteristically  instead of saying   Oh yes  I was a playwright  and this is what blah blah blah   she said   Oh  playwright. Everybody knows I was a playwright. Most people think that I was an actress. I was never an actress.  But I hadn't asked that  and then she went off on a tear  and she said   Oh  well  there was that one time that I was an actress. It was for a charity in Connecticut when I was a congresswoman  and I got up there   and she went on and on   And then I got on the stage.  And then she turned to me and said   And you know what those young actors did  They upstaged me.  And she said   Do you know what that is   Just withering in her contempt. And I said   I'm learning.  And she looked at me  and it was like the successful arm wrestle  and then  after that  she delivered an extraordinary account of what her life really was like. I have to end that one. This is my tribute to Clare Boothe Luce. Again  a remarkable person. I'm not politically attracted to her  but through her life force  I'm attracted to her. And the way she died    she had  toward the end  a brain tumor. That's probably as terrible a way to die as you can imagine  and very few of us were invited to a dinner party. And she was in horrible pain. We all knew that. She stayed in her room. Everybody came. The butler passed around canapes. The usual sort of thing. Then at a certain moment  the door opened and she walked out perfectly dressed  completely composed. The public self  the beauty  the intellect  and she walked around and talked to every person there and then went back into the room and was never seen again. She wanted the control of her final moment  and she did it amazingly. Now  there are other ways that you get somebody to open up  and this is just a brief reference. It wasn't this arm wrestle  but it was a little surprising for the person involved. I interviewed Steve Martin. It wasn't all that long ago. And we were sitting there  and almost toward the beginning of the interview  I turned to him and I said   Steve   or  Mr. Martin  it is said that all comedians have unhappy childhoods. Was yours unhappy   And he looked at me  you know  as if to say   This is how you're going to start this thing  right off   And then he turned to me  not stupidly  and he said   What was your childhood like   And I said    these are all arm wrestles  but they're affectionate    and I said   My father was loving and supportive  which is why I'm not funny.  And he looked at me  and then we heard the big sad story. His father was an SOB  and  in fact  he was another comedian with an unhappy childhood  but then we were off and running. So the question is  What is the key that's going to allow this to proceed  Now  these are arm wrestle questions  but I want to tell you about questions that are more related to empathy and that really  very often  are the questions that people have been waiting their whole lives to be asked. And I'll just give you two examples of this because of the time constraints. One was an interview I did with one of the great American biographers. Again  some of you will know him  most of you won't  Dumas Malone. He did a five volume biography of Thomas Jefferson  spent virtually his whole life with Thomas Jefferson  and by the way  at one point I asked him   Would you like to have met him   And he said   Well  of course  but actually  I know him better than anyone who ever met him  because I got to read all of his letters.  So  he was very satisfied with the kind of relationship they had over    years. And I asked him one question. I said   Did Jefferson ever disappoint you   And here is this man who had given his whole life to uncovering Jefferson and connecting with him  and he said   Well ...     I'm going to do a bad southern accent. Dumas Malone was from Mississippi originally. But he said   Well   he said   I'm afraid so.  He said   You know  I've read everything  and sometimes Mr. Jefferson would smooth the truth a bit.  And he basically was saying that this was a man who lied more than he wished he had  because he saw the letters. He said   But I understand that.  He said   I understand that.  He said   We southerners do like a smooth surface  so that there were times when he just didn't want the confrontation.  And he said   Now  John Adams was too honest.  And he started to talk about that  and later on he invited me to his house  and I met his wife who was from Massachusetts  and he and she had exactly the relationship of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams. She was the New Englander and abrasive  and he was this courtly fellow. But really the most important question I ever asked  and most of the times when I talk about it  people kind of suck in their breath at my audacity  or cruelty  but I promise you it was the right question. This was to Agnes de Mille. Agnes de Mille is one of the great choreographers in our history. She basically created the dances in  Oklahoma   transforming the American theater. An amazing woman. At the time that I proposed to her that    by the way  I would have proposed to her  she was extraordinary    but proposed to her that she come on. She said   Come to my apartment.  She lived in New York.  Come to my apartment and we'll talk for those    minutes  and then we'll decide whether we proceed.  And so I showed up in this dark  rambling New York apartment  and she called out to me  and she was in bed. I had known that she had had a stroke  and that was some    years before. And so she spent almost all of her life in bed  but    I speak of the life force    her hair was askew. She wasn't about to make up for this occasion. And she was sitting there surrounded by books  and her most interesting possession she felt at that moment was her will  which she had by her side. She wasn't unhappy about this. She was resigned. She said   I keep this will by my bed  memento mori  and I change it all the time just because I want to.  And she was loving the prospect of death as much as she had loved life. I thought  this is somebody I've got to get in this series. She agreed. She came on. Of course she was wheelchaired on. Half of her body was stricken  the other half not. She was  of course  done up for the occasion  but this was a woman in great physical distress. And we had a conversation  and then I asked her this unthinkable question. I said   Was it a problem for you in your life that you were not beautiful   And the audience just    you know  they're always on the side of the interviewee  and they felt that this was a kind of assault  but this was the question she had wanted somebody to ask her whole life. And she began to talk about her childhood  when she was beautiful  and she literally turned    here she was  in this broken body    and she turned to the audience and described herself as the fair demoiselle with her red hair and her light steps and so forth  and then she said   And then puberty hit.  And she began to talk about things that had happened to her body and her face  and how she could no longer count on her beauty  and her family then treated her like the ugly sister of the beautiful one for whom all the ballet lessons were given. And she had to go along just to be with her sister for company  and in that process  she made a number of decisions. First of all  was that dance  even though it hadn't been offered to her  was her life. And secondly  she had better be  although she did dance for a while  a choreographer because then her looks didn't matter. But she was thrilled to get that out as a real  real fact in her life. It was an amazing privilege to do this series. There were other moments like that  very few moments of silence. The key point was empathy because everybody in their lives is really waiting for people to ask them questions  so that they can be truthful about who they are and how they became what they are  and I commend that to you  even if you're not doing interviews. Just be that way with your friends and particularly the older members of your family. Thank you very much. Good morning. I've come here to share with you an experiment of how to get rid of one form of human suffering. It really is a story of Dr. Venkataswamy. His mission and his message is about the Aravind Eye Care System. I think first it's important for us to recognize what it is to be blind. Woman  Everywhere I went looking for work  they said no  what use do we have for a blind woman  I couldn't thread a needle or see the lice in my hair. If an ant fell into my rice  I couldn't see that either. Thulasiraj Ravilla  Becoming blind is a big part of it  but I think it also deprives the person of their livelihood  their dignity  their independence  and their status in the family. So she is just one amongst the millions who are blind. And the irony is that they don't need to be. A simple  well proven surgery can restore sight to millions  and something even simpler  a pair of glasses  can make millions more see. If we add to that the many of us here now who are more productive because they have a pair of glasses  then almost one in five Indians will require eye care  a staggering     million people. Today  we're reaching not even    percent of them. So this is the context in which Aravind came into existence about    years back as a post retirement project of Dr. V. He started this with no money. He had to mortgage all his life savings to make a bank loan. And over time  we have grown into a network of five hospitals  predominately in the state of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry  and then we added several  what we call Vision Centers as a hub and spoke model. And then more recently we started managing hospitals in other parts of the country and also setting up hospitals in other parts of the world as well. The last three decades  we have done about three and a half million surgeries  a vast majority of them for the poor people. Now  each year we perform about         surgeries. A typical day at Aravind  we would do about a thousand surgeries  maybe see about       patients  send out teams into the villages to examine  bring back patients  lots of telemedicine consultations  and  on top of that  do a lot of training  both for doctors and technicians who will become the future staff of Aravind. And then doing this day in and day out  and doing it well  requires a lot of inspiration and a lot of hard work. And I think this was possible thanks to the building blocks put in place by Dr. V.  a value system  an efficient delivery process  and fostering the culture of innovation. Dr. V  I used to sit with the ordinary village man because I am from a village  and suddenly you turn around and seem to be in contact with his inner being  you seem to be one with him. Here is a soul which has got all the simplicity of confidence. Doctor  whatever you say  I accept it. An implicit faith in you and then you respond to it. Here is an old lady who has got so much faith in me  I must do my best for her. When we grow in spiritual consciousness  we identify ourselves with all that is in the world  so there is no exploitation. It is ourselves we are helping. It is ourselves we are healing. This helped us build a very ethical and very highly patient centric organization and systems that support it. But on a practical level  you also have to deliver services efficiently  and  odd as it may seem  the inspiration came from McDonald's. Dr. V  See  McDonald's' concept is simple. They feel they can train people all over the world  irrespective of different religions  cultures  all those things  to produce a product in the same way and deliver it in the same manner in hundreds of places. Larry Brilliant  He kept talking about McDonalds and hamburgers  and none of it made any sense to us. He wanted to create a franchise  a mechanism of delivery of eye care with the efficiency of McDonald's. Dr. V  Supposing I'm able to produce eye care  techniques  methods  all in the same way  and make it available in every corner of the world. The problem of blindness is gone. TR  If you think about it  I think the eyeball is the same  as American or African  the problem is the same  the treatment is the same. And yet  why should there be so much variation in quality and in service  and that was the fundamental principle that we followed when we designed the delivery systems. And  of course  the challenge was that it's a huge problem  we are talking of millions of people  very little resource to deal with it  and then lots of logistics and affordability issues. And then so  one had to constantly innovate. And one of the early innovations  which still continues  is to create ownership in the community to the problem  and then engage with them as a partner  and here is one such event. Here a community camp just organized by the community themselves  where they find a place  organize volunteers  and then we'll do our part. You know  check their vision  and then you have doctors who you find out what the problem is and then determine what further testing should be done  and then those tests are done by technicians who check for glasses  or check for glaucoma. And then  with all these results  the doctor makes a final diagnosis  and then prescribes a line of treatment  and if they need a pair of glasses  they are available right there at the camp site  usually under a tree. But they get glasses in the frames of their choice  and that's very important because I think glasses  in addition to helping people see  is also a fashion statement  and they're willing to pay for it. So they get it in about    minutes and those who require surgery  are counseled  and then there are buses waiting  which will transport them to the base hospital. And if it was not for this kind of logistics and support  many people like this would probably never get services  and certainly not when they most need it. They receive surgery the following day  and then they will stay for a day or two  and then they are put back on the buses to be taken back to where they came from  and where their families will be waiting to take them back home. And this happens several thousand times each year. It may sound impressive that we're seeing lots of patients  very efficient process  but we looked at  are we solving the problem  We did a study  a scientifically designed process  and then  to our dismay  we found this was only reaching seven percent of those in need  and we're not adequately addressing more  bigger problems. So we had to do something different  so we set up what we call primary eye care centers  vision centers. These are truly paperless offices with completely electronic medical records and so on. They receive comprehensive eye exams. We kind of changed the simple digital camera into a retinal camera  and then every patient gets their teleconsultation with a doctor. The effect of this has been that  within the first year  we really had a    percent penetration in the market that it served  which is over        people. And the second year went up to    percent. So I think we have a process by which we can really penetrate into the market and reach everyone who needs it  and in this process of using technology  make sure that most don't need to come to the base hospital. And how much will they pay for this  We fixed the pricing  taking into account what they would save in bus fare in coming to a city  so they pay about    rupees  and that's good for three consultations. The other challenge was  how do you give high tech or more advanced treatment and care  We designed a van with a VSAT  which sends out images of patients to the base hospital where it is diagnosed  and then as the patient is waiting  the report goes back to the patient  it gets printed out  the patient gets it  and then gets a consultation about what they should be doing    I mean  go see a doctor or come back after six months  and then this happens as a way of bridging the technology competence. So the impact of all this has been essentially one of growing the market  because it focused on the non customer  and then by reaching the unreached  we're able to significantly grow the market. The other aspect is how do you deal with this efficiently when you have very few ophthalmologists  So what is in this video is a surgeon operating  and then you see on the other side  another patient is getting ready. So  as they finish the surgery  they just swing the microscope over  the tables are placed so that their distance is just right  and then we need to do this  because  by doing this kind of process  we're able to more than quadruple the productivity of the surgeon. And then to support the surgeon  we require a certain workforce. And then we focused on village girls that we recruited  and then they really are the backbone of the organization. They do almost all of the skill based routine tasks. They do one thing at a time. They do it extremely well. With the result we have very high productivity  very high quality at very  very low cost. So  putting all this together  what really happened was the productivity of our staff was significantly higher than anyone else. This is a very busy table  but what this really is conveying is that  when it comes to quality  we have put in very good quality assurance systems. As a result  our complications are significantly lower than what has been reported in the United Kingdom  and you don't see those kind of numbers very often. So the final part of the puzzle is  how do you make all this work financially  especially when the people can't pay for it  So what we did was  we gave away a lot of it for free  and then those who pay  I mean  they paid local market rates  nothing more  and often much less. And we were helped by the market inefficiency. I think that has been a big savior  even now. And  of course  one needs the mindset to be wanting to give away what you have as a surplus. The result has been  over the years  the expenditure has increased with volumes. The revenues increase at a higher level  giving us a healthy margin while you're treating a large number of people for free. I think in absolute terms  last year we earned about    odd million dollars  spent about    million  with over a    percent EBITA. But this really requires going beyond what we do  or what we have done  if you really want to achieve solving this problem of blindness. And what we did was a couple of very counter intuitive things. We created competition for ourselves  and then we made eye care affordable by making low cost consumables. We proactively and systematically promoted these practices to many hospitals in India  many in our own backyards and then in other parts of the world as well. The impact of this has been that these hospitals  in the second year after our consultation  are double their output and then achieve financial recovery as well. The other part was how do you address this increase in cost of technology  There was a time when we failed to negotiate the  intra ocular lens  prices to be at affordable levels  so we set up a manufacturing unit. And then  over time  we were able to bring down the cost significantly to about two percent of what it used to be when we started out. Today  we believe we have about seven percent of the global market  and they're used in about     odd countries. To conclude  I mean  what we do  does it have a broader relevance  or is it just India or developing countries  So to address this  we studied UK versus Aravind. What it shows is that we do roughly about    percent of the volume of what the UK does  near a half million surgeries as a whole country. And we do about        . And then we train about    ophthalmologists against the    trained by them  comparable quality  both in training and in patient care. So we're really comparing apples to apples. We looked at cost. So  I think it is simple to say just because the U.K. isn't India the difference is happening. I think there is more to it. I mean  I think one has to look at other aspects as well. Maybe there is    the solution to the cost could be in productivity  maybe in efficiency  in the clinical process  or in how much they pay for the lenses or consumables  or regulations  their defensive practice. So  I think decoding this can probably bring answers to most developed countries including the U.S.  and maybe Obama's ratings can go up again. Another insight  which  again  I want to leave with you  in conditions where the problem is very large  which cuts across all economic strata  where we have a good solution  I think the process I described  you know  productivity  quality  patient centered care  can give an answer  and there are many which fit this paradigm. You take dentistry  hearing aid  maternity and so on. There are many where this paradigm can now play  but I think probably one of the most challenging things is on the softer side. Now  how do you create compassion  Now  how do you make people own the problem  want to do something about it  There are a bit harder issues. And I'm sure people in this crowd can probably find the solutions to these. So I want to end my talk leaving this thought and challenge to you. Dr. V  When you grow in spiritual consciousness  we identify with all that is in the world so there is no exploitation. It is ourselves we are helping. It is ourselves we are healing. TR  Thank you very much. Hello  everyone. Because this is my first time at TED  I've decided to bring along an old friend to help break the ice a bit. Yes. That's right. This is Barbie. She's    years old. And she's looking as young as ever. But I'd also like to introduce you to what may be an unfamiliar face. This is Fulla. Fulla is the Arab world's answer to Barbie. Now  according to proponents of the clash of civilizations  Barbie and Fulla occupy these completely separate spheres. They have different interests. They have divergent values. And should they ever come in contact ... well  I've got to tell you  it's just not going to be pretty. My experience  however  in the Islamic world is very different. Where I work  in the Arab region  people are busy taking up Western innovations and changing them into things which are neither conventionally Western  nor are they traditionally Islamic. I want to show you two examples. The first is  Shbab. It means  for youth  and it's a new Arab TV channel. The USA.   I am not afraid to stand alone     I am not afraid to stand alone  if Allah is by my side     I am not afraid to stand alone     Everything will be all right     I am not afraid to stand alone   The Arab world.   She was preserved by modesty of the religion     She was adorned by the light of the Quran   Shereen El Feki   Shbab has been dubbed Islamic MTV. Its creator  who is an Egyptian TV producer called Ahmed Abu Ha ba  wants young people to be inspired by Islam to lead better lives. He reckons the best way to get that message across is to use the enormously popular medium of music videos.  Shbab was set up as an alternative to existing Arab music channels. And they look something like this. That  by the way is Haifa Wehbe. She's a Lebanese pop star and pan Arab pin up girl. In the world of  Shbab  it's not about bump and grind. But it's not about fire and brimstone either. Its videos are intended to show a kinder  gentler face of Islam  for young people to deal with life's challenges. Now  my second example is for a slightly younger crowd. And it's called  The   .  Now  these are the world's first Islamic superheroes. They were created by a Kuwaiti psychologist called Naif Al Mutawa. And his desire is to rescue Islam from images of intolerance  all in a child friendly format.  The   .  The characters are meant to embody the    attributes of Allah  justice  wisdom  mercy  among others. So  for example  there is the character of Noora. She is meant to have the power to look inside people and see the good and bad in everyone. Another character called Jami has the ability to create fantastic inventions. Now   The     is not just a comic book. It's now a theme park. There is an animated series in the works. And by this time next year  the likes of Superman and Wonder Woman will have joined forces with  The     to beat injustice wherever they find it.  The     and  Shbab are just two of many examples of this sort of Islamic cross cultural hybridization. We're not talking here about a clash of civilizations. Nor is it some sort of indistinguishable mash. I like to think of it as a mesh of civilizations  in which the strands of different cultures are intertwined. Now  while  Shbab and  The     may look new and shiny  there is actually a very long tradition of this. Throughout its history  Islam has borrowed and adapted from other civilizations both ancient and modern. After all  it's the Quran which encourages us to do this   We made you into nations and tribes so that you could learn from one another.  And to my mind  those are pretty wise words  no matter what your creed. Thank you. I'm going to show you how terrorism actually interacts with our daily life.    years ago I received a phone call from a friend. At the time he was looking after the rights of political prisoners in Italian jails. He asked me if I wanted to interview the Red Brigades. Now  as many of you may remember  the Red Brigades was a terrorist  Marxist organization which was very active in Italy from the     s until the mid     s. As part of their strategy the Red Brigades never spoke with anybody  not even with their lawyers. They sat in silence through their trails  waving occasionally at family and friends. In      they declared the end of the armed struggle. And they drew a list of people with whom they would talk  and tell their story. And I was one of those people. When I asked my friend why the Red Brigades want to talk to me  he said that the female members of the organization had actually supported my name. In particular  one person had put it forward. She was my childhood friend. She had joined the Red Brigades and became a leader of the organization. Naturally  I didn't know that until the day she was arrested. In fact  I read it in the newspaper. At the time of the phone call I just had a baby  I successfully completed a management buyout to the company I was working with  and the last thing I wanted to do was to go back home and touring the high security prisons. But this is exactly what I did because I wanted to know what had turned my best friend into a terrorist  and why she'd never tried to recruit me. So  this is exactly what I did. Now  I found the answer very quickly. I actually had failed the psychological profiling of a terrorist. The center committee of the Red Brigades had judged me too single minded and too opinionated to become a good terrorist. My friend  on the other hand  she was a good terrorist because she was very good at following orders. She also embraced violence. Because she believed that the only way to unblock what  at the time  was known as a blocked democracy  Italy  a country run by the same party for    years was the arms struggle. At the same time  while I was interviewing the Red Brigades  I also discovered that their life was not ruled by politics or ideology  but actually was ruled by economics. They were constantly short of cash. They were constantly searching for cash. Now  contrary to what many people believe  terrorism is actually a very expensive business. I'll give you an idea. In the     s  the turnover of the Red Brigades on a yearly basis was seven million dollars. This is roughly between     and     million  today. Now  you know  if you live underground it's really hard to produce this amount of money. But this also explains why  when I was interviewing the Red Brigades  and then  later on  other arms organizations  including members of al Zarqawi group in the Middle East  everybody was extremely reluctant to talk about ideology  or politics. Because they had no idea. The political vision of a terrorist organization is decided by the leadership  which  generally  is never more than five to seven people. All the others do  day in and day out  is search for money. Once  for example  I was interviewing this part timer from the Red Brigades. It was a psychiatrist. He loved sailing. He was a really keen sailor. And he had this beautiful boat. And he told me that the best time of his life was when he was a member of the Red Brigades and he went sailing  every summer  back and forth from Lebanon  where he would pick up Soviet weapons from the PLO  and then carry them all the way to Sardinia where the other arms organization from Europe would go and take their share of the arms. For that service the Red Brigades were actually paid a fee  which went to fund their organization. So  because I am a trained economist and I think in economic terms  all of the sudden I thought  maybe there is something here. Maybe there is a link  a commercial link  between one organization and another one. But it was only when I interviewed Mario Moretti  the head of the Red Brigades  the man who kidnapped and killed Aldo Moro  Italian former prime minister  that I finally realized that terrorism is actually business. I was having lunch with him in a high security prison in Italy. And as we were eating  I had the distinct feeling that I was back in the city of London  having lunch with a fellow banker or an economist. This guy thought in the same way I did. So  I decided that I wanted to investigate the economics of terrorism. Naturally  nobody wanted to fund my research. In fact  I think many people thought that I was a bit crazy. You know  that woman that goes around to foundations asking for money  thinking about the economics of terrorism. So  in the end  I took a decision that  in retrospect  did change my life. I sold my company  and funded the research myself. And what I discovered is this parallel reality  another international economic system  which runs parallel to our own  which has been created by arms organizations since the end of World War II. And what is even more shocking is that this system has followed  step by step  the evolution of our own system  of our Western capitalism. And there are three main stages. The first one is the state sponsor of terrorism. The second one is the privatization of terrorism. And the third  of course  is the globalization of terrorism. So  state sponsor of terrorism  feature of the Cold War. This is when the two superpowers were fighting a war by proxy  along the periphery of the sphere of influence  fully funding arms organizations. A mix of legal and illegal activities is used. So  the link between crime and terror is established very early on. And here is the best example  the Contras in Nicaragua  created by the CIA  legally funded by the U.S. Congress  illegally funded by the Reagan administration via covert operation  for example  the Iran Contra Affair. Then comes the late     s  early '  s  and some groups successfully carry out the privatization of terrorism. So  they gain independence from the sponsor  and start funding themselves. Now  again we see a mix of legal and illegal activities. So  Arafat used to get a percentage of the smuggling of hashish from Bek a Valley  which is the valley between Lebanon and Syria. And the IRA  which control the private transportation system in Northern Ireland  did exactly the same thing. So  every single time that somebody got into a taxi in Belfast without knowing  actually  was funding the IRA. But the great change came  of course  with globalization and deregulation. This is when arms organization were able to link up  also financially  with each other. But above all  they started to do serious business with the world of crime. And together they money laundered their dirty business through the same channel. This is when we see the birth of the transnational arms organization Al Qaeda. This is an organization that can raise money across border. But also that is able to carry out attacks in more than one country. Now  deregulation also brought back rogue economics. So what is rogue economics  Rogue economics is a force which is constantly lurking in the background of history. It comes back at times of great transformation  globalization being one of those transformations. It is at this times in which politics actually loses control of the economy  and the economy becomes a rogue force working against us. It has happened before in history. It has happened with the fall of the Roman Empire. It has happened with Industrial Revolution. And it actually happened again  with the fall of the Berlin wall. Now  I calculated how big was this international economic system composed by crime  terror  and illegal economy  before     . And it is a staggering  .  trillion dollars. It is trillions  it's not billions. This is about twice the GDP of the United Kingdom  soon will be more  considering where this country is going. Now  until       the bulk of all this money flew into the U.S. economy because the bulk of the money was denominated in U.S. dollars and the money laundering was taking place inside the United States. The entry point  of course  of most of this money were the off shore facilities. So  this was a vital injection of cash into the U.S. economy. Now  when I went to look at the figures of the U.S. money supply  the U.S. money supply is the amount of dollars that the Federal Reserve prints every year in order to satisfy the increase in the demand for dollars  which  of course  reflects the growth of the economy. So  when I went to look at those figures  I noted that since the late     s a growing number of these dollars was actually leaving the United States  never to come back. These were money taken out in suitcases or in containers  in cash of course. These were money taken out by criminals and money launderers. These were money taken out to fund the growth of the terror  illegal and criminal economy. So  you see  what is the relationship  The United States actually is a country that is the reserve currency of the world. What does it mean  That means that it has a privilege that other countries do not have. It can borrow against the total amount of dollars in circulation in the world. This privilege is called seigniorage. No other country can do that. All the other countries  for example the United Kingdom  can borrow only against the amount of money in circulation inside its own borders. So  here is the implication of the relationship between the worlds of crime  terror  and illegal economy  and our economy. The U.S. in the     s was borrowing against the growth of the terror  illegal and criminal economy. This is how close we are with this world. Now  this situation changed  of course  after       because George Bush launched the War on Terror. Part of the War on Terror was the introduction of the Patriot Act. Now  many of you know that the Patriot Act is a legislation that greatly reduces the liberties of Americans in order to protect them against terrorism. But there is a section of the Patriot Act which refers specifically to finance. And it is  in fact  an anti money laundering legislation. What the Patriot Act did was to prohibit U.S. bank  and U.S. registered foreign banks from doing any businesses with off shore facilities. It closed that door between the money laundering in dollars  and the U.S. economy. It also gave the U.S. monetary authorities the right to monitor any dollar transaction taking place anywhere in the world. Now  you can imagine what was the reaction of the international finance and banking. All the bankers said to their clients   Get out of the dollars and go and invest somewhere else.  Now  the Euro was a newly born currency of great opportunity for business  and  of course  for investment. And this is what people did. Nobody wants the U.S. monetary authority to check their relationship  to monitor their relationship with their clientele. The same thing happened  of course  in the world of crime and terror. People simply moved their money laundering activities away from the United States into Europe. Why did this happen  This happened because the Patriot Act was a unilateral legislation. It was introduced only in the United States. And it was introduced only for the U.S. dollars. In Europe  a similar legislation was not introduced. So  within six months Europe became the epicenter of the money laundering activities of the world. So  this is how incredible are the relationship between the world of crime and the world of terror  and our own life. So  why did I tell you this story  I told you this story because you must understand that there is a world that goes well beyond the headlines of the newspapers  including the personal relationship that you have with friends and family. You got to question everything that is told to you  including what I just told you today. This is the only way for you to step into the dark side  and have a look at it. And believe me  it's going to be scary. It's going to be frightful  but it's going to enlighten you. And  above all  it's not going to be boring. My name is Ryan Lobo  and I've been involved in the documentary filmmaking business all over the world for the last    years. During the process of making these films I found myself taking photographs  often much to the annoyance of the video cameramen. I found this photography of mine almost compulsive. And at the end of a shoot  I would sometimes feel that I had photographs that told a better story than a sometimes sensational documentary. I felt  when I had my photographs  that I was holding on to something true  regardless of agendas or politics. In       I traveled to three war zones. I traveled to Iraq  Afghanistan and Liberia. And over there I experienced other people's suffering  up close and personal  immersed myself in some rather intense and emotional stories  and at times I experienced great fear for my own life. As always  I would return to Bangalore  and often to animated discussions at friend's homes  where we would discuss various issues while they complained bitterly about the new pub timings  where a drink often cost more than what they'd paid their    year old maid. I would feel very isolated during these discussions. But at the same time  I questioned myself and my own integrity and purpose in storytelling. And I decided that I had compromised  just like my friends in those discussions  where we told stories in contexts we made excuses for  rather than taking responsibility for. I won't go into details about what led to a decision I made  but let's just say it involved alcohol  cigarettes  other substances and a woman. I basically decided that it was I  not the camera or the network  or anything that lay outside myself  that was the only instrument in storytelling truly worth tuning. In my life  when I tried to achieve things like success or recognition  they eluded me. Paradoxically  when I let go of these objectives  and worked from a place of compassion and purpose  looking for excellence  rather than the results of it  everything arrived on its own  including fulfillment. Photography transcended culture  including my own. And it is  for me  a language which expressed the intangible  and gives voice to people and stories without. I invite you into three recent stories of mine  which are about this way of looking  if you will  which I believe exemplify the tenets of what I like to call compassion in storytelling. In      I went to Liberia  where a group of my friends and I did an independent  self funded film  still in progress  on a very legendary and brutal war lord named General Butt Naked. His real name is Joshua  and he's pictured here in a cell where he once used to torture and murder people  including children. Joshua claims to have personally killed more than        people during Liberia's civil war. He got his name from fighting stark naked. And he is probably the most prolific mass murderer alive on Earth today. This woman witnessed the General murdering her brother. Joshua commanded his child soldiers to commit unspeakable crimes  and enforced his command with great brutality. Today many of these children are addicted to drugs like heroin  and they are destitute  like these young men in the image. How do you live with yourself if you know you've committed horrific crimes  Today the General is a baptized Christian evangelist. And he's on a mission. We accompanied Joshua  as he walked the Earth  visiting villages where he had once killed and raped. He seeked forgiveness  and he claims to endeavor to improve the lives of his child soldiers. During this expedition I expected him to be killed outright  and us as well. But what I saw opened my eyes to an idea of forgiveness which I never thought possible. In the midst of incredible poverty and loss  people who had nothing absolved a man who had taken everything from them. He begs for forgiveness  and receives it from the same woman whose brother he murdered. Senegalese  the young man seated on the wheelchair here  was once a child soldier  under the General's command  until he disobeyed orders  and the General shot off both his legs. He forgives the General in this image. He risked his life as he walked up to people whose families he'd murdered. In this photograph a hostile crowd in a slum surrounds him. And Joshua remains silent as they vented their rage against him. This image  to me  is almost like from a Shakespearean play  with a man  surrounded by various influences  desperate to hold on to something true within himself  in a context of great suffering that he has created himself. I was intensely moved during all this. But the question is  does forgiveness and redemption replace justice  Joshua  in his own words  says that he does not mind standing trial for his crimes  and speaks about them from soapboxes across Monrovia  to an audience that often includes his victims. A very unlikely spokesperson for the idea of separation of church and state. The second story I'm going to tell you about is about a group of very special fighting women with rather unique peace keeping skills. Liberia has been devastated by one of Africa's bloodiest civil wars  which has left more than         people dead  thousands of women scarred by rape and crime on a spectacular scale. Liberia is now home to an all woman United Nations contingent of Indian peacekeepers. These women  many from small towns in India  help keep the peace  far away from home and family. They use negotiation and tolerance more often than an armed response. The commander told me that a woman could gauge a potentially violent situation much better than men. And that they were definitely capable of diffusing it non aggressively. This man was very drunk  and he was very interested in my camera  until he noticed the women  who handled him with smiles  and AK   s at the ready  of course. This contingent seems to be quite lucky  and it has not sustained any casualties  even though dozens of peacekeepers have been killed in Liberia. And yes  all of those people killed were male. Many of the women are married with children  and they say the hardest part of their deployment was being kept away from their children. I accompanied these women on their patrols  and watched as they walked past men  many who passed very lewd comments incessantly. And when I asked one of the women about the shock and awe response  she said   Don't worry  same thing back home. We know how to deal with these fellows   and ignored them. In a country ravaged by violence against women  Indian peacekeepers have inspired many local women to join the police force. Sometimes  when the war is over and all the film crews have left  the most inspiring stories are the ones that float just beneath the radar. I came back to India and nobody was interested in buying the story. And one editor told me that she wasn't interested in doing what she called  manual labor stories.  In      and      I did stories on the Delhi Fire Service  the DFS  which  during the summer  is probably the world's most active fire department. They answer more than       calls in just two months. And all this against incredible logistical odds  like heat and traffic jams. Something amazing happened during this shoot. Due to a traffic jam  we were late in getting to a slum  a large slum  which had caught fire. As we neared  angry crowds attacked our trucks and stoned them  by hundreds of people all over the place. These men were terrified  as the mob attacked our vehicle. But nonetheless  despite the hostility  firefighters left the vehicle and successfully fought the fire. Running the gauntlet through hostile crowds  and some wearing motorbike helmets to prevent injury. Some of the local people forcibly took away the hoses from the firemen to put out the fire in their homes. Now  hundreds of homes were destroyed. But the question that lingered in my mind was  what causes people to destroy fire trucks headed to their own homes  Where does such rage come from  And how are we responsible for this     percent of the    million people who live in Delhi live in unauthorized slums  which are chronically overcrowded. They lack even the most basic amenities. And this is something that is common to all our big cities. Back to the DFS. A huge chemical depot caught fire  thousands of drums filled with petrochemicals were blazing away and exploding all around us. The heat was so intense  that hoses were used to cool down firefighters fighting extremely close to the fire  and with no protective clothing. In India we often love to complain about our government bodies. But over here  the heads of the DFS  Mr. R.C. Sharman  Mr. A.K. Sharman  led the firefight with their men. Something wonderful in a country where manual labor is often looked down upon. Over the years  my faith in the power of storytelling has been tested. And I've had very serious doubt about its efficacy  and my own faith in humanity. However  a film we shot still airs on the National Geographic channel. And when it airs I get calls from all the guys I was with and they tell me that they receive hundreds of calls congratulating them. Some of the firemen told me that they were also inspired to do better because they were so pleased to get thank yous rather than brick bats. It seems that this story helped change perceptions about the DFS  at least in the minds of an audience in part on televisions  read magazines and whose huts aren't on fire. Sometimes  focusing on what's heroic  beautiful and dignified  regardless of the context  can help magnify these intangibles three ways  in the protagonist of the story  in the audience  and also in the storyteller. And that's the power of storytelling. Focus on what's dignified  courageous and beautiful  and it grows. Thank you. So  now  there are a lot of web  .  consultants who make a lot of money. In fact  they make their livings on this kind of stuff. I'm going to try and save you all the time and all the money and go through it in the next three minutes  so bear with me. Started a website back in       with a few friends of mine  called Reddit.com. That's what you'd call a social news website. Basically all that means is that the democratic front page is the best stuff on the web. You find some interesting content  say a TEDTalk  submit it to Reddit  and the community of your peers will vote it up if they like it  vote it down if they don't. And that creates the front page. It's always rising  falling  always changing. About a half million people visit every day. But this isn't about Reddit. This is actually about discovering new things that pop up on the web. Because in the last four years we've seen all kinds of memes  all kinds of trends get born right on our front page. But this isn't even about Reddit itself. It's actually about humpback whales. Well  okay  technically it's actually about Greenpeace  which is an environmental organization that wanted to stop the Japanese government on their whaling campaign. These humpback whales were getting killed. They wanted to put an end to it. And one of the ways they wanted to do it was to put a tracking chip inside one of these humpback whales. But to really kind of personify the movement  they wanted to name it. So  in true web fashion they put together a poll where they had a bunch of very erudite  very thoughtful  cultured names. I believe this is a Farsi word for  immortal.  I think this means  divine power of the ocean  in a Polynesian language. And then there was this  Mister Splashy Pants. And this  this was special. Mister Pants  or Splashy  to his friends  was very popular on the Internet. In fact  someone on Reddit thought   Oh  what a great thing  we should all vote this up.  And  you know  Redditors responded and all agreed. So  the voting started and we actually got behind it ourselves. We changed our logo  for the day  from the alien to a Splashy  to sort of help the cause. And it wasn't long before other sites like Fark and Boing Boing and the rest of the Internet started saying   Yes  We love Splashy Pants.  So  it went from about five percent  which was when this meme started  to    percent at the end of voting. Which is pretty impressive right  We won  Mister Splashy Pants was chosen. Hmm  just kidding. Okay. So  Greenpeace actually wasn't that crazy about it  because they wanted one of their more thoughtful names to win. So they said   No  no  just kidding. We'll give it another week of voting.  Well  that got us a little angry. So  we changed it to Fightin' Splashy. And the Reddit community  really  and the rest of the internet  rather  really got behind this. Facebook groups were getting created. Facebook applications were getting created. The idea was   Vote your conscience   vote for Mister Splashy Pants. And people were putting up signs in the real world    And this was the final vote. When all was cleared ...    percent of the votes  and to give you an idea of the landslide  the next highest name pulled in three. Okay  So  there was a clear lesson here. And that was that the Internet loves Mister Splashy Pants. Which is obvious. It's a great name. Everyone wants to hear their news anchor say   Mister Splashy Pants.  And I think that's what helped drive this. But what was cool was that the repercussions now for Greenpeace was  they created an entire marketing campaign around it. They sell Mister Splashy Pants shirts and pins. They even created an e card so you could send your friend a dancing Splashy. But what was even more important was the fact that they actually accomplished their mission. The Japanese government called off their whaling expedition. Mission accomplished. Greenpeace was thrilled. The whales were happy. That's a quote. And actually  Redditors in the Internet community were happy to participate  but they weren't whale lovers. A few of them certainly were. But we're talking about a lot of people who were just really interested and really caught up in this great meme  and in fact someone from Greenpeace came back on the site and thanked Reddit for its participation. But this wasn't really out of altruism. This was just out of interest in doing something cool. And this is kind of how the Internet works. This is that great big secret. Because the Internet provides this level playing field. Your link is just as good as your link  which is just as good as my link. As long as we have a browser  anyone can get to any website no matter how big a budget you have. That is  as long as you can keep net neutrality in place. The other important thing is that it costs nothing to get that content online now. There are so many great publishing tools that are available  it only takes a few minutes of your time now to actually produce something. And the cost of iteration is so cheap that you might as well give it a go. And if you do  be genuine about it. Be honest. Be up front. And one of the great lessons that Greenpeace actually learned was that it's okay to lose control. It's okay to take yourself a little less seriously  given that  even though it's a very serious cause  you could ultimately achieve your final goal. And that's the final message that I want to share with all of you    that you can do well online. But no longer is the message going to be coming from just the top down. If you want to succeed you've got to be okay to just lose control. Thank you. Actually  I come from Britain  but I've been living in Maldives for    years now. So  that's home really. The Maldives  as I'm sure you're aware  are a chain of islands off the southwest coast of India here. Capital  Mal   where I live. Actually  sitting here today in Mysore  we're closer to Mal  than we are to Delhi  for example. If you're in IT  India  obviously  is the place to be at the moment. But if you're a marine biologist  Maldives is not such a bad place to be. And it has been my home these years. For those of you who've been there  fantastic coral reefs  fantastic diving  fantastic snorkeling. I spend as much of my time as possible investigating the marine life. I study fish  also the bigger things  whales and dolphins. This is a blue whale. We have blue whales in the waters around here  off Maldives  around the waters of India. You can see them off Kerala. And  in fact  we're very lucky in this region. One of the best places in the world to see blue whales is here in this region. In Sri Lanka  if you go down to the south coast of Sri Lanka  during the northeast monsoon season  you can see blue whales very  very easily. It's probably the best place in the world to see them. Now  when I talk about the northeast monsoon season  I'm sure many of you here know exactly what I mean  but perhaps some of you are not quite so sure. I need to explain a little bit about monsoons. Now  monsoon  the root of the word  monsoon  comes from the word  season.  So  it's just a season. And there are two seasons in most of South Asia. And in the summer India heats up  gets very hot. Hot air rises  and air is drawn in off the sea to replace it. And the way it works is  it comes from the southwest. It comes off the ocean here and is drawn up towards India. So it comes from the southwest. It's a southwest monsoon. Picks up moisture as it crosses the ocean. That's what brings the monsoon rain. And then in the winter things cool down. High pressure builds over India. And the whole system goes into reverse. So  the wind is now coming from the northeast out of India  across the Indian Ocean  this way towards Africa. Keep that in mind. Now  I'm a marine biologist  but I'm actually a bit of an old fashioned naturalist  I suppose. I'm interested in all sorts of things  almost everything that moves  including dragonflies. And I'm actually going to talk  this afternoon  about dragonflies. This is a very beautiful species  it's called the Oriental Scarlet. And one thing you need to know about dragonflies  one important thing  is that they lay their eggs in fresh water. They need fresh water to breed. They lay the eggs into fresh water. Little larvae hatch out in fresh water. They feed on other little things. They feed on mosquito larvae. So  they're very important. They control mosquito larvae  among other things. And they grow and grow by stages. And they climb out of the water  burst out  as the adult which we see. And typically  there is a lot of variation  but if you have a dragonfly with  say  a one year life cycle  which is quite typical  the larva  living in the fresh water  lives for    or    months. And then the adult  which comes after  lives for one or two months. So it's essentially a freshwater animal. It really does need fresh water. Now  the particular species of dragonfly I want to talk about is this one  because most dragonflies  like the one we've just seen  when the adult is there for its brief one or two months of life  it doesn't go very far. It can't travel very far. A few kilometers  maybe  is quite typical. They are very good fliers  but they don't go too far. But this guy is an exception. And this is called the Globe Skimmer  or Wandering Glider. And  as the name might suggest  it is found pretty much around the world. It lives throughout the tropics  the Americas  Africa  Asia  Australia  into the Pacific. And it wanders far and wide. We know that much about it. But it really hasn't been studied very much. It's a rather mediocre looking dragonfly. If you're going to study dragonflies  you want to study those really bright beautiful ones  like that red one. Or the really rare ones  the endemic endangered ones. This is  it seems a bit dull you know. It's sort of dull colored. And it's fairly common. And it occurs everywhere    you know  why bother  But if you take that attitude  you're actually missing something rather special. Because this dragonfly has a rather amazing story to tell. And I feel very privileged to have stumbled across it living in the Maldives. When I first went to the Maldives  dead keen on diving  spent as much of my time as I could in and under the water. Didn't notice any dragonflies  maybe they were there  maybe they weren't. Didn't notice them. But after some time  after some months  one day as I was going out and about  suddenly I noticed hundreds of dragonflies  hundreds of dragonflies. Something like this  these are all this species Globe Skimmer. I didn't know at the time  but I know now  they're Globe Skimmers  hundreds of them. And they were there for some time. And then they were gone. And I didn't think anything more of it until the following year  when it happened again  and then the year after that  and then the year after that. And I was a bit slow  I didn't really take too much notice. But I asked some Maldivian friends and colleagues  and yes they come every year. And I asked people about them and yes  they knew  but they didn't know anything  where they came from  or anything. And again I didn't think too much of it. But slowly it began to dawn on me that something rather special was happening. Because dragonflies need fresh water to breed. And the Maldives  and I'm sure some of you have been there    so here is home. So  Maldives  beautiful place. It's built entirely of coral reefs. And on top of the coral reefs are sand banks. Average height  about that much above sea level. So  global warming  sea level rise  it's a real serious issue. But I'm not going to talk about that. Another important point of these sand banks is that when it rains  the rainwater soaks down into the soil. So  it's gone. So  it stays under the soil. The trees can put their roots into it. Humans can dig holes and make a well. But dragonflies    a bit tricky. There is no surface fresh water. There are no ponds  streams  rivers  lakes  nothing like that. So  why is it that every year millions of dragonflies  millions  millions of dragonflies turn up  I got a little bit curious. In fact I'll stop here  because I want to ask  and there is a lot of people who  from India of course  people who grew up spending your childhood here. Those of you who are Indian or spent your childhood here  let me have a show of hands  who of you    not yet  not yet  You're too keen. You're too keen. No. Hang on. Hang on. Wait for the go. I'll say go. Those of you who grew up in India  do you remember in your childhood  dragonflies  swarms of dragonflies  Maybe at school  maybe tying little bits of string onto them  Maybe pulling bits off  I'm not asking about that. You've only got to say  do you remember seeing lots of dragonflies. Any hands  Any hands  Yes. Thank you. Thank you. It's a widespread phenomenon throughout South Asia  including the Maldives. And I got a bit curious about it. In the Maldives    now  in India there is plenty of water  so  dragonflies  yeah  of course. Why not  But in Maldives  no fresh water. So  what on Earth is going on  And the first thing I did was started recording when they turned up in the Maldives. And there is the answer    st of October. Not every year  that's the average date. So  I've been writing it down for    years now. You'd think they're coming from India. It's the closest place. But in October  remember  we're still in southwest monsoon  Maldives is still in the southwest monsoon. But wind is  invariably  every time  is from the west. It's going towards India  not from India. So  are these things  how are these things getting here  Are they coming from India against the wind  Seemed a bit unlikely. So  next thing I did is I got on the phone. Maldives is a long archipelago. It stretches about     miles  of course it's India here. I got on the phone and emailed to friends and colleagues. When do you see the dragonflies appear  And pretty soon  a picture started emerging. In Bangalore  a colleague there sent me information for three years  average    th of September  so late September. Down in Trivandrum  a bit later. Far north of Maldives  a bit later. Then Mal   then further south. And then the southernmost Maldives. It's pretty obvious  they're coming from India. But they are coming     miles across the ocean  against the wind. How on Earth are they doing that  I didn't know. The next thing I did was I started counting dragonflies. I wanted to know about their seasonality  what time of year  this is when they first arrive  but how long are they around for  Does that give any clues  So  I started a very rigorous scientific process. I had a rigorous scientific transect. I got on my bicycle  and I cycled around the island of Mal . It's about five kilometers around  counting the dragonflies as I go  trying not to bump into people as I'm looking in the trees. And they're here for a very short time  October  November  December. That's it. And then they tail off  there's a few  but that's it. October  November  December. That is not the northeast monsoon season. That's not the southwest season. That's the inter monsoon  the time when the monsoon changes. Now  what I said was  you get the southwest monsoon going one way  and then it changes and you get the northeast monsoon going the other way. And that sort of gives the impression you've got one air mass going up and down  up and down. It doesn't work like that. What happens  actually  is there is two air masses. And there is a front between them  and the front moves. So  if you've got India here  when the front is up above India you're into the southwest monsoon. Then the front moves into the northeast monsoon. And that front in the middle is not vertical  it's at an angle. So  as it comes over towards Mal  I'm standing in Mal  underneath the front. I can be in the southwest monsoon. But the wind above is from the northeast monsoon. So  the dragonflies are actually coming from India on the northeast monsoon  but at an altitude at       to       meters up in the air. Incredible. These little insects  it's the same ones we see out here  in India   two inches long  five centimeters long  flying in their millions      miles across the ocean  at       meters up. Quite incredible. So  I was quite pleased with myself. I thought wow  I've tracked this one  I know how they come here. Then I scratched my head a bit  and that's okay  I know how they come here  but why do they come here  What are millions of dragonflies doing  flying out over the ocean every year to their apparent doom  It doesn't make sense. There is nothing for them in Maldives. What on Earth are they doing  Well  to cut a long story short  they're actually flying right across the ocean. They're making it all the way across to East Africa. I know that because I have friends who work on fisheries' research vessels who have sent to me reports from boats out in the ocean. I know because we have reports from Seychelles  which fit in as well  down here. And I know because when you look at the rainfall  these particular insects  these Globe Skimmers breed in temporary rain water pools. Okay  they lay their eggs where the seasonal rains are  the monsoon rains. The larvae have to develop very quickly. They only take six weeks. Instead of    months  they're six weeks. They're up  and they're off. Now  here we have  in case you can't read at the back  the top is rainfall for India. And we're starting in June. So this is the monsoon rain. By September  October  it's drying out. Nothing for these dragonflies. There is no more seasonal rain. They've got to go hunting for seasonal rain. And they fly south. As the monsoon withdraws to the south they come down through Karnataka  into Kerala. And then they run out of land. But they are incredibly good fliers. This particular species  it can fly for thousands of kilometers. And it just keeps going. And the wind  the northeast wind swooshes it around and carries it off across the ocean to Africa  where it's raining. And they are breeding in the rains of Africa. Now  this is southeast Africa. It makes it look like there are sort of two breeding periods here. It's slightly more complicated than that. What's happening is they are breeding in the monsoon rains here. And the dragonflies you can see today outside here  on the campus  are the young of this generation. They hatched out in India. They're looking for somewhere to breed. If it rains here they'll breed. But most of them are going to carry on. And next stop  perhaps only four or five days away is going to be East Africa. The wind will swoosh them out across here. If they pass the Maldives they might go and have a look  nothing there  they'll carry on. Here  here  Kenya  East Africa  they've actually just come out of a long drought. Just last week the rains broke. The short rains broke and it's raining there now. And the dragonflies are there. I have reports from my various contacts. The dragonflies are here now. They're breeding there. When those guys  they'll lay their eggs now. They'll hatch out in six weeks. By that time the seasonal rains have moved on. It's not there  it's down here. They'll fly down here. And the clever thing is the wind is always converging to where the rain is. The rain occurs  these are summer rains. This is a summer monsoon. The sun is overhead there. Summer rains in southern Africa. The sun is overhead  maximum heating  maximum evaporation  maximum clouds  maximum rainfall  maximum opportunities for reproduction. Not only that  because you have this convection  you have this rising of the air where it's hot  air is drawn in. There's a convergence. So  wherever the rain is falling  the air is drawn towards it to replace the air that's rising. So  the little fellow that hatches out here  he gets up into the air  he is automatically carried to where the rain is falling. Lay their eggs  next generation  they come up  automatically carried to where the rain is falling. It's now back there. They come out  it's time to come back. So  in four generations  one  two  three  four and then back. A complete circuit of the Indian Ocean. This is a circuit of about        kilometers.        kilometers  four generations  mind you  for a two inch long insect. It's quite incredible. Those of you from North America will be familiar with the Monarch butterfly. Which  up until now has had the longest known insect migration. It's only half the length of this one. And this crossing here  of the ocean  is the only truly regular transoceanic crossing of any insect. A quite incredible feat. And I only stumbled on this because I was living in Mal   in Maldives for long enough for it to percolate into my brain that something rather special was going on. But dragonflies are not the only creatures that make the crossing. There is more to the story. I'm also interested in birds. And I'm familiar with this fellow. This is a rather special bird. It's a falcon. It's called the eastern red footed falcon  obviously. But it's also called the Amur Falcon. And it's called the Amur Falcon because it breeds in Amurland. Which is an area along the Amur River  which is up here. It's the border  much of it is the border between China and Russia  up here in the far east. So  Siberia  Manchuria. And that's where it breeds. And if you're a falcon it's quite a nice place to be in the summer. But it's a pretty miserable place to be in the winter. It's  well  you can imagine. So  as any sensible bird would do  he moves south. They move south. The whole population moves south. But then the being sensible stopped. So  now they don't stop here  or even down here. No  they turn across here. They have a little refueling stop in northeastern India. They come to the latitude of about Mumbai or Goa. And then they strike out across the ocean  down to Kenya. And down here  and they winter down here  in southern Africa . Incredible. This is the most extraordinary migration of any bird of prey. A quite incredible migration. And they are not the only one that makes the crossing. They have the most incredible journey  but several make the crossing from India to Africa. Includes this one  the hobby. This fellow is a very nice bird  this is the Pied cuckoo. Those of you from northern India will be familiar with this. It comes with the monsoons. This time of year they cross back to Africa. And this guy  the roller  a rather beautiful bird. It's known as the Eurasian Roller. In India it occurs in the northwest  so it's known as the Kashmir Roller. And these birds  what I've done is I've complied all the records  all the available records of these birds  put them together  and found out they migrate at exactly the same time as the dragonflies. They make use of exactly the same winds. They travel at exactly the same time with the same winds to make the crossing. I know they travel at the same altitude. It's known about the Amur Falcon. This guy  unfortunately  one of these met an unfortunate end. He was flying off the coast of Goa     years ago      . October      . An Indian Navy jet was flying off Goa  bang  In the middle of the night. Fortunately  a two engine jet got back to base  and they pulled the remains of one of these  Eurasian Rollers  out. Flying at night over the Indian Ocean       meters. Same height as the dragonflies go. So  they are using the same winds. And the other thing  the other important factor for all these birds  all medium sized fellows  and this includes the next slide as well  which is a bee eater. Bee eaters eat bees. This one has a nice blue cheek. It's a Blue cheeked Bee eater. And every one of these birds that makes the crossing from India to East Africa eats insects  large insects  the size of dragonflies. Thank you very much. Metaphor lives a secret life all around us. We utter about six metaphors a minute. Metaphorical thinking is essential to how we understand ourselves and others  how we communicate  learn  discover and invent. But metaphor is a way of thought before it is a way with words. Now  to assist me in explaining this  I've enlisted the help of one of our greatest philosophers  the reigning king of the metaphorians  a man whose contributions to the field are so great that he himself has become a metaphor. I am  of course  referring to none other than Elvis Presley. Now   All Shook Up  is a great love song. It's also a great example of how whenever we deal with anything abstract    ideas  emotions  feelings  concepts  thoughts    we inevitably resort to metaphor. In  All Shook Up   a touch is not a touch  but a chill. Lips are not lips  but volcanoes. She is not she  but a buttercup. And love is not love  but being all shook up. In this  Elvis is following Aristotle's classic definition of metaphor as the process of giving the thing a name that belongs to something else. This is the mathematics of metaphor. And fortunately it's very simple. X equals Y. This formula works wherever metaphor is present. Elvis uses it  but so does Shakespeare in this famous line from  Romeo and Juliet   Juliet is the sun. Now  here  Shakespeare gives the thing  Juliet  a name that belongs to something else  the sun. But whenever we give a thing a name that belongs to something else  we give it a whole network of analogies too. We mix and match what we know about the metaphor's source  in this case the sun  with what we know about its target  Juliet. And metaphor gives us a much more vivid understanding of Juliet than if Shakespeare had literally described what she looks like. So  how do we make and understand metaphors  This might look familiar. The first step is pattern recognition. Look at this image. What do you see  Three wayward Pac Men  and three pointy brackets are actually present. What we see  however  are two overlapping triangles. Metaphor is not just the detection of patterns  it is the creation of patterns. Second step  conceptual synesthesia. Now  synesthesia is the experience of a stimulus in once sense organ in another sense organ as well  such as colored hearing. People with colored hearing actually see colors when they hear the sounds of words or letters. We all have synesthetic abilities. This is the Bouba Kiki test. What you have to do is identify which of these shapes is called Bouba  and which is called Kiki. If you are like    percent of other people  you will identify the round  amoeboid shape as Bouba  and the sharp  spiky one as Kiki. Can we do a quick show of hands  Does that correspond  Okay  I think   .  would about cover it. Why do we do that  Because we instinctively find  or create  a pattern between the round shape and the round sound of Bouba  and the spiky shape and the spiky sound of Kiki. And many of the metaphors we use everyday are synesthetic. Silence is sweet. Neckties are loud. Sexually attractive people are hot. Sexually unattractive people leave us cold. Metaphor creates a kind of conceptual synesthesia  in which we understand one concept in the context of another. Third step is cognitive dissonance. This is the Stroop test. What you need to do here is identify as quickly as possible the color of the ink in which these words are printed. You can take the test now. If you're like most people  you will experience a moment of cognitive dissonance when the name of the color is printed in a differently colored ink. The test shows that we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words even when the literal meaning gives the wrong answer. Stroop tests have been done with metaphor as well. The participants had to identify  as quickly as possible  the literally false sentences. They took longer to reject metaphors as false than they did to reject literally false sentences. Why  Because we cannot ignore the metaphorical meaning of words either. One of the sentences was   Some jobs are jails.  Now  unless you're a prison guard  the sentence  Some jobs are jails  is literally false. Sadly  it's metaphorically true. And the metaphorical truth interferes with our ability to identify it as literally false. Metaphor matters because it's around us every day  all the time. Metaphor matters because it creates expectations. Pay careful attention the next time you read the financial news. Agent metaphors describe price movements as the deliberate action of a living thing  as in   The NASDAQ climbed higher.  Object metaphors describe price movements as non living things  as in   The Dow fell like a brick.  Researchers asked a group of people to read a clutch of market commentaries  and then predict the next day's price trend. Those exposed to agent metaphors had higher expectations that price trends would continue. And they had those expectations because agent metaphors imply the deliberate action of a living thing pursuing a goal. If  for example  house prices are routinely described as climbing and climbing  higher and higher  people might naturally assume that that rise is unstoppable. They may feel confident  say  in taking out mortgages they really can't afford. That's a hypothetical example of course. But this is how metaphor misleads. Metaphor also matters because it influences decisions by activating analogies. A group of students was told that a small democratic country had been invaded and had asked the U.S. for help. And they had to make a decision. What should they do  Intervene  appeal to the U.N.  or do nothing  They were each then given one of three descriptions of this hypothetical crisis. Each of which was designed to trigger a different historical analogy  World War II  Vietnam  and the third was historically neutral. Those exposed to the World War II scenario made more interventionist recommendations than the others. Just as we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words  we cannot ignore the analogies that are triggered by metaphor. Metaphor matters because it opens the door to discovery. Whenever we solve a problem  or make a discovery  we compare what we know with what we don't know. And the only way to find out about the latter is to investigate the ways it might be like the former. Einstein described his scientific method as combinatory play. He famously used thought experiments  which are essentially elaborate analogies  to come up with some of his greatest discoveries. By bringing together what we know and what we don't know through analogy  metaphorical thinking strikes the spark that ignites discovery. Now metaphor is ubiquitous  yet it's hidden. But you just have to look at the words around you and you'll find it. Ralph Waldo Emerson described language as  fossil poetry.  But before it was fossil poetry language was fossil metaphor. And these fossils still breathe. Take the three most famous words in all of Western philosophy   Cogito ergo sum.  That's routinely translated as   I think  therefore I am.  But there is a better translation. The Latin word  cogito  is derived from the prefix  co   meaning  together   and the verb  agitare   meaning  to shake.  So  the original meaning of  cogito  is to shake together. And the proper translation of  cogito ergo sum  is  I shake things up  therefore I am.  Metaphor shakes things up  giving us everything from Shakespeare to scientific discovery in the process. The mind is a plastic snow dome  the most beautiful  most interesting  and most itself  when  as Elvis put it  it's all shook up. And metaphor keeps the mind shaking  rattling and rolling  long after Elvis has left the building. Thank you very much. The anger in me against corruption made me to make a big career change last year  becoming a full time practicing lawyer. My experiences over the last    months  as a lawyer  has seeded in me a new entrepreneurial idea  which I believe is indeed worth spreading. So  I share it with all of you here today  though the idea itself is getting crystallized and I'm still writing up the business plan. Of course it helps that fear of public failure diminishes as the number of ideas which have failed increases. I've been a huge fan of enterprise and entrepreneurship since     . I've explored  experienced  and experimented enterprise and capitalism to my heart's content. I built  along with my two brothers  the leading real estate company in my home state  Kerala  and then worked professionally with two of India's biggest businessmen  but in their startup enterprises. In       when I stepped out of the pure play capitalistic sector to work on so called social sector issues  I definitely did not have any grand strategy or plan to pursue and find for profit solutions to addressing pressing public issues. When life brought about a series of death and near death experiences within my close circle  which highlighted the need for an emergency medical response service in India  similar to     in USA. To address this  I  along with four friends  founded Ambulance Access for All  to promote life support ambulance services in India. For those from the developing world  there is nothing  absolutely nothing new in this idea. But as we envisioned it  we had three key goals  Providing world class life support ambulance service which is fully self sustainable from its own revenue streams  and universally accessible to anyone in a medical emergency  irrespective of the capability to pay. The service which grew out of this  Dial      for Ambulance  with one ambulance in       now has a hundred plus ambulances in three states  and has transported over         patients and victims since inception. The service is     Applause  fully self sustainable from its own revenues  without accessing any public funds  and the cross subsidy model actually works  where the rich pays higher  poor pays lower  and the accident victim is getting the service free of charge. The service responded effectively and efficiently  during the unfortunate       Mumbai terror attacks. And as you can see from the visuals  the service was responding and rescuing victims from the incident locations even before the police could cordon off the incident locations and formally confirm it as a terror strike. We ended up being the first medical response team in every incident location and transported     victims  saving life. In tribute and remembrance of       attacks over the last one year  we have actually helped a Pakistani NGO  Aman Foundation  to set up a self sustainable life support ambulance service in Karachi  facilitated by Acumen Fund. It's a small message from us  in our own small way to the enemies of humanity  of Islam  of South Asia  of India  and of Pakistan  that humanity will continue to bloom  irrespective of such dastardly attacks. Since then I've also co founded two other social enterprises. One is Education Access for All  setting up schools in small town India. And the other is Moksha Yug Access  which is integrating rural supply chain on the foundations of self help group based microfinance. I guess we seem to be doing at least a few things right. Because diligent investors and venture funds have committed over  .  million dollars in funding. With the significance being these funds have come in as a QT capital  not as grant or as philanthropy. Now I come back to the idea of the new social enterprise that I'm exploring. Corruption  bribes  and lack of transparency. You may be surprised to know that eight speakers yesterday actually mentioned these terms in their talks. Bribes and corruption have both a demand and a supply side  with the supply side being mostly of greedy corporate unethical businesses and hapless common man. And the demand side being mostly politicians  bureaucrats and those who have discretionary power vested with them. According to World Bank estimate  one trillion dollars is paid in bribes every year  worsening the condition of the already worse off. Yet  if you analyze the common man  he or she does not wake up every day and say   Hmm  let me see who I can pay a bribe to today.  or   Let me see who I can corrupt today.  Often it is the constraining or the back to the wall situation that the hapless common man finds himself or herself in that leads him to pay a bribe. In the modern day world  where time is premium and battle for subsistence is unimaginably tough  the hapless common man simply gives in and pays the bribe just to get on with life. Now  let me ask you another question. Imagine you are being asked to pay a bribe in your day to day life to get something done. What do you do  Of course you can call the police. But what is the use if the police department is in itself steeped in corruption  Most definitely you don't want to pay the bribe. But you also don't have the time  resources  expertise or wherewithal to fight this. Unfortunately  many of us in this room are supporters of capitalist policies and market forces. Yet the market forces around the world have not yet thrown up a service where you can call in  pay a fee  and fight the demand for a bribe. Like a bribe buster service  or       Fight Bribes  or www.stopbribes.org or www.preventcorruption.org. Such a service simply do not exist. One image that has haunted me from my early business days is of a grandmother     plus years  being harassed by the bureaucrats in the town planning office. All she needed was permission to build three steps to her house  from ground level  making it easier for her to enter and exit her house. Yet the officer in charge would not simply give her the permit for want of a bribe. Even though it pricked my conscience then  I could not  or rather I did not tend to her or assist her  because I was busy building my real estate company. I don't want to be haunted by such images any more. A group of us have been working on a pilot basis to address individual instances of demands for bribes for common services or entitlement. And in all    cases where we have pushed back such demands using existing and legitimate tools like the Right to Information Act  video  audio  or peer pressure  we have successfully obtained whatever our clients set out to achieve without actually paying a bribe. And with the cost of these tools being substantially lower than the bribe demanded. I believe that these tools that worked in these    pilot cases can be consolidated in standard processes in a BPO kind of environment  and made available on web  call center and franchise physical offices  for a fee  to serve anyone confronted with a demand for a bribe. The target market is as tempting as it can get. It can be worth up to one trillion dollars  being paid in bribes every year  or equal to India's GDP. And it is an absolutely virgin market. I propose to explore this idea further  to examine the potential of creating a for profit  fee based BPO kind of service to stop bribes and prevent corruption. I do realize that the fight for justice against corruption is never easy. It never has been and it never will be. In my last    months as a lawyer  battling small  and large scale corruption  including the one perpetrated by India's biggest corporate scamster. Through his charities I have had three police cases filed against me alleging trespass  impersonation and intimidation. The battle against corruption exacts a toll on ourselves  our families  our friends  and even our kids. Yet I believe the price we pay is well worth holding on to our dignity and making the world a fairer place. What gives us the courage  As my close friend replied  when told during the seeding days of the ambulance project that it is an impossible task and the founders are insane to chalk up their blue chip jobs  I quote   Of course we cannot fail in this  at least in our own minds. For we are insane people  trying to do an impossible task. And an insane person does not know what an impossible task is.  Thank you. Chris Anderson  Shaffi  that is a really exciting business idea. Shaffi Mather  I just have to get through the initial days where I don't get eliminated. CA  What's on your mind  I mean  give us a sense of the numbers here    a typical bribe and a typical fee. I mean  what's in your head  SM  So let me ... Let me give you an example. Somebody who had applied for the passport. The officer was just sitting on it and was demanding around       rupees in bribes. And he did not want to pay. So we actually used the Right to Information Act  which is equal to the Freedom of Information Act in the United States  and pushed back the officers in this particular case. And in all these    cases  when we kept pushing them back  there was three kinds of reaction. A set of people actually say   Oh  let me just grant it to them  and run away from it.  Some people actually come back and say   Oh  you want to screw me. Let me show you what I can do.  And he will push us back. So you take the next step  or use the next tool available in what we are putting together  and then he relents. By the third time  in all    cases  we have achieved success. CA  But if it's a       rupee     dollar bribe  what fee would you have to charge  and can you actually make the business work  SM  Well  actually the cost that we incurred was less than     rupees. So  it actually works. CA  That's a high gross margin business. I like it. SM  I actually did not want to answer this on the TED stage. CA  OK  so these are provisional numbers  no pricing guarantee. If you can pull this off  you will be a global hero. I mean  this could be huge. Thank you so much for sharing this idea at TED. The key question is   When are we going to get fusion   It's really been a long time since we've known about fusion. We've known about fusion since       when Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington and the British Association for the Advancement of Science conjectured that that's why the sun shines. I've always been very worried about resource. I don't know about you  but when my mother gave me food  I always sorted the ones I disliked from the ones I liked. And I ate the disliked ones first  because the ones you like  you want to save. And as a child you're always worried about resource. And once it was sort of explained to me how fast we were using up the world's resources  I got very upset  about as upset as I did when I realized that the Earth will only last about five billion years before it's swallowed by the sun. Big events in my life  a strange child. Energy  at the moment  is dominated by resource. The countries that make a lot of money out of energy have something underneath them. Coal powered industrial revolution in this country    oil  gas  sorry. Gas  I'm probably the only person who really enjoys it when Mister Putin turns off the gas tap  because my budget goes up. We're really dominated now by those things that we're using up faster and faster and faster. And as we try to lift billions of people out of poverty in the Third World  in the developing world  we're using energy faster and faster. And those resources are going away. And the way we'll make energy in the future is not from resource  it's really from knowledge. If you look    years into the future  the way we probably will be making energy is probably one of these three  with some wind  with some other things  but these are going to be the base load energy drivers. Solar can do it  and we certainly have to develop solar. But we have a lot of knowledge to gain before we can make solar the base load energy supply for the world. Fission. Our government is going to put in six new nuclear power stations. They're going to put in six new nuclear power stations  and probably more after that. China is building nuclear power stations. Everybody is. Because they know that that is one sure way to do carbon free energy. But if you wanted to know what the perfect energy source is  the perfect energy source is one that doesn't take up much space  has a virtually inexhaustible supply  is safe  doesn't put any carbon into the atmosphere  doesn't leave any long lived radioactive waste  it's fusion. But there is a catch. Of course there is always a catch in these cases. Fusion is very hard to do. We've been trying for    years. Okay. What is fusion  Here comes the nuclear physics. And sorry about that  but this is what turns me on. I was a strange child. Nuclear energy comes for a simple reason. The most stable nucleus is iron  right in the middle of the periodic table. It's a medium sized nucleus. And you want to go towards iron if you want to get energy. So  uranium  which is very big  wants to split. But small atoms want to join together  small nuclei want to join together to make bigger ones to go towards iron. And you can get energy out this way. And indeed that's exactly what stars do. In the middle of stars  you're joining hydrogen together to make helium and then helium together to make carbon  to make oxygen  all the things that you're made of are made in the middle of stars. But it's a hard process to do because  as you know  the middle of a star is quite hot  almost by definition. And there is one reaction that's probably the easiest fusion reaction to do. It's between two isotopes of hydrogen  two kinds of hydrogen  deuterium  which is heavy hydrogen  which you can get from seawater  and tritium which is super heavy hydrogen. These two nuclei  when they're far apart  are charged. And you push them together and they repel. But when you get them close enough  something called the strong force starts to act and pulls them together. So  most of the time they repel. You get them closer and closer and closer and then at some point the strong force grips them together. For a moment they become helium    because they've got five particles inside them. So  that's that process there. Deuterium and tritium goes together makes helium  . Helium splits out  and a neutron comes out and lots of energy comes out. If you can get something to about     million degrees  things will be rattling around so fast that every time they collide in just the right configuration  this will happen  and it will release energy. And that energy is what powers fusion. And it's this reaction that we want to do. There is one trickiness about this reaction. Well  there is a trickiness that you have to make it     million degrees  but there is a trickiness about the reaction yet. It's pretty hot. The trickiness about the reaction is that tritium doesn't exist in nature. You have to make it from something else. And you make if from lithium. That reaction at the bottom  that's lithium    plus a neutron  will give you more helium  plus tritium. And that's the way you make your tritium. But fortunately  if you can do this fusion reaction  you've got a neutron  so you can make that happen. Now  why the hell would we bother to do this  This is basically why we would bother to do it. If you just plot how much fuel we've got left  in units of present world consumption. And as you go across there you see a few tens of years of oil    the blue line  by the way  is the lowest estimate of existing resources. And the yellow line is the most optimistic estimate. And as you go across there you will see that we've got a few tens of years  and perhaps     years of fossil fuels left. And god knows we don't really want to burn all of it  because it will make an awful lot of carbon in the air. And then we get to uranium. And with current reactor technology we really don't have very much uranium. And we will have to extract uranium from sea water  which is the yellow line  to make conventional nuclear power stations actually do very much for us. This is a bit shocking  because in fact our government is relying on that for us to meet Kyoto  and do all those kind of things. To go any further you would have to have breeder technology. And breeder technology is fast breeders. And that's pretty dangerous. The big thing  on the right  is the lithium we have in the world. And lithium is in sea water. That's the yellow line. And we have    million years worth of fusion fuel in sea water. Everybody can get it. That's why we want to do fusion. Is it cost competitive  We make estimates of what we think it would cost to actually make a fusion power plant. And we get within about the same price as current electricity. So  how would we make it  We have to hold something at     million degrees. And  in fact  we've done this. We hold it with a magnetic field. And inside it  right in the middle of this toroidal shape  doughnut shape  right in the middle is     million degrees. It boils away in the middle at     million degrees. And in fact we can make fusion happen. And just down the road  this is JET. It's the only machine in the world that's actually done fusion. When people say fusion is    years away  and always will be  I say   Yeah  but we've actually done it.  Right  We can do fusion. In the center of this device we made    megawatts of fusion power in     . And in      we're going to fire it up again and break all those records. But that's not really fusion power. That's just making some fusion happen. We've got to take that  we've got to make that into a fusion reactor. Because we want    million years worth of fusion power for the Earth. This is the device we're building now. It gets very expensive to do this research. It turns out you can't do fusion on a table top despite all that cold fusion nonsense. Right  You can't. You have to do it in a very big device. More than half the world's population is involved in building this device in southern France  which is a nice place to put an experiment. Seven nations are involved in building this. It's going to cost us    billion. And we'll produce half a gigawatt of fusion power. But that's not electricity yet. We have to get to this. We have to get to a power plant. We have to start putting electricity on the grid in this very complex technology. And I'd really like it to happen a lot faster than it is. But at the moment  all we can imagine is sometime in the     s. I wish this were different. We really need it now. We're going to have a problem with power in the next five years in this country. So      looks like an infinity away. But we can't abandon it now  we have to push forward  get fusion to happen. I wish we had more money  I wish we had more resources. But this is what we're aiming at  sometime in the     s    real electric power from fusion. Thank you very much. Namaste. Salaam. Shalom. Sat Sri Akal. Greetings to all of you from Pakistan. It is often said that we fear that which we do not know. And Pakistan  in this particular vein  is very similar. Because it has provoked  and does provoke  a visceral anxiety in the bellies of many a Western soul  especially when viewed through the monochromatic lens of turbulence and turmoil. But there are many other dimensions to Pakistan. And what follows is a stream of images  a series of images captured by some of Pakistan's most dynamic and young photographers  that aims to give you an alternative glimpse  a look inside the hearts and minds of some ordinary Pakistani citizens. Here are some of the stories they wanted us to share with you. My name is Abdul Khan. I come from Peshawar. I hope that you will be able to see not just my Taliban like beard  but also the richness and color of my perceptions  aspirations and dreams  as rich and colorful as the satchels that I sell. My name is Meher and this is my friend Irim. I hope to become a vet when I grow up so that I can take care of stray cats and dogs who wander around the streets of the village that I live near Gilgit  northern Pakistan. My name is Kailash. And I like to enrich lives through technicolored glass. Madame  would you like some of those orange bangles with the pink polka dots  My name is Zamin. And I'm an IDP  an internally displaced person  from Swat. Do you see me on the other side of this fence  Do I matter  or really exist for you  My name is Iman. I am a fashion model  an up and coming model from Lahore. Do you see me simply smothered in cloth  Or can you move beyond my veil and see me for who I truly am inside  My name is Ahmed. I am an Afghan refugee from the Khyber agency. I have come from a place of intense darkness. And that is why I want to illuminate the world. My name is Papusay. My heart and drum beat as one. If religion is the opium of the masses  then for me  music is my one and only ganja. A rising tide lifts all boats. And the rising tide of India's spectacular economic growth has lifted over     million Indians into a buoyant middle class. But there are still over     million Indians  Pakistanis  Sri Lankans  Bangladeshis  Nepalese  who remain washed up on the shores of poverty. Therefore as India and Pakistan  as you and I  it behooves us to transcend our differences  to celebrate our diversity  to leverage our common humanity. Our collective vision at Naya Jeevan  which for many of you  as you all recognize  means  new life  in Urdu and Hindi  is to rejuvenate the lives of millions of low income families by providing them with affordable access to catastrophic health care. Indeed it is the emerging world's first HMO for the urban working poor. Why should we do this as Indians and Pakistanis  We are but two threads cut from the same cloth. And if our fates are intertwined  then we believe that it is good karma  it is good fortune. And for many of us  our fortunes do indeed lie at the bottom of the pyramid. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Fantastic. Just stay up here. That was fantastic. I found that really moving. You know  we fought hard to get at least a small Pakistani contingent to come. It felt like it was really important. They went through a lot to get here. Would the Pakistanis please just stand up please  I just really wanted to acknowledge you. Thank you so much. Well  I learned a lot of things about ballooning  especially at the end of these balloon flights around the world I did with Brian Jones. When I took this picture  the window was frozen because of the moisture of the night. And on the other side there was a rising sun. So  you see that on the other side of ice you have the unknown  you have the non obvious  you have the non seen  for the people who don't dare to go through the ice. There are so many people who prefer to suffer in the ice they know instead of taking the risk of going through the ice to see what there is on the other side. And I think that's one of the main problems of our society. We learn  maybe not the famous TED audience  but so many other people learn  that the unknown  the doubts  the question marks are dangerous. And we have to resist to the changes. We have to keep everything under control. Well  the unknown is part of life. And in that sense  ballooning is a beautiful metaphor. Because in the balloon  like in life  we go very well in unforeseen directions. We want to go in a direction  but the winds push us in another direction  like in life. And as long as we fight horizontally  against life  against the winds  against what's happening to us  life is a nightmare. How do we steer a balloon  By understanding that the atmosphere is made out of several different layers of wind which all have different direction. So  then  we understand that if we want to change our trajectory  in life  or in the balloon  we have to change altitude. Changing altitude  in life  that means raising to another psychological  philosophical  spiritual level. But how do we do that  In ballooning  or in life  how do we change altitude  How do we go from the metaphor to something more practical that we can really use every day  Well  in a balloon it's easy  we have ballast. And when we drop the ballast overboard we climb. Sand  water  all the equipment we don't need anymore. And I think in life it should be exactly like this. You know  when people speak about pioneering spirit  very often they believe that pioneers are the ones who have new ideas. It's not true. The pioneers are not the ones who have new ideas  because new ideas are so easy to have. We just close our eyes for a minute we all come back with a lot of new ideas. No  the pioneer is the one who allows himself to throw overboard a lot of ballast. Habits  certainties  convictions  exclamation marks  paradigms  dogmas. And when we are able to do that  what happens  Life is not anymore just one line going in one direction in one dimension. No. Life is going to be made out of all the possible lines that go in all the possible directions in three dimensions. And pioneering spirit will be each time we allow ourselves to explore this vertical axis. Of course not just like the atmosphere in the balloon  but in life itself. Explore this vertical axis  that means explore all the different ways to do  all the different ways to behave  all the different ways to think  before we find the one that goes in the direction we wish. This is very practical. This can be in politics. This can be in spirituality. This can be in environment  in finance  in education of children. I deeply believe that life is a much greater adventure if we manage to do politics without the trench between the left and the right wing. Because we will throw away these political dogmas. I deeply believe that we can make much more protection of the environment if we get rid    if we throw overboard this fundamentalism that some of the greens have showed in the past. And that we can aim for much higher spirituality if we get rid of the religious dogmas. Throwing overboard  as ballast  to change our direction. Well  these basically are things I believed in such a long time. But actually I had to go around the world in a balloon to be invited to talk about it. It's clear that it's not easy to know which ballast to drop and which altitude to take. Sometime we need friends  family members or a psychiatrist. Well  in balloons we need weather men  the one who calculate the direction of each layer of wind  at which altitude  in order to help the balloonist. But sometimes it's very paradoxical. When Brian Jones and I were flying around the world  the weather man asked us  one day  to fly quite low  and very slow. And when we calculated we thought we're never going to make it around the world at that speed. So  we disobeyed. We flew much higher  and double the speed. And I was so proud to have found that jetstream that I called the weather man  and I told him   Hey  guy  don't you think we're good pilots up there  We fly twice the speed you predicted.  And he told me   Don't do that. Go down immediately in order to slow down.  And I started to argue. I said   I'm not going to do that. We don't have enough gas to fly so slow.  And he told me   Yes  but with the low pressure you have on your left if you fly too fast  in a couple of hours you will turn left and end up at the North Pole. And then he asked me    and this is something I will never forget in my life    he just asked me   You're the good pilot up there. What do you really want  You want to go very fast in the wrong direction  or slowly in the good direction  And this is why you need weathermen. This is why you need people with long term vision. And this is precisely what fails in the political visions we have now  in the political governments. We are burning  as you heard  so much energy  not understanding that such an unsustainable way of life cannot last for long. So  we went down actually. We slowed down. And we went through moments of fears because we had no idea how the little amount of gas we had in the balloon could allow us to travel        kilometers. But we were expected to have doubts  we're expected to have fears. And actually this is where the adventure really started. When we were flying over the Sahara and India it was nice holidays. We could land anytime and fly back home with an airplane. In the middle of the Pacific  when you don't have the good winds  you cannot land  you cannot go back. That's a crisis. That's the moment when you have to wake up from the automatic way of thinking. That's the moment when you have to motivate your inner potential  your creativity. That's when you throw out all the ballast  all the certainties  in order to adapt to the new situation. And actually  we changed completely our flight plan. We changed completely our strategy. And after    days we landed successfully in Egypt. But if I show you this picture it's not to tell you how happy we were. It's to show you how much gas was left in the last bottles. We took off with  .  tons of liquid propane. We landed with    kilos. When I saw that  I made a promise to myself. I made a promise that the next time I would fly around the world  it would be with no fuel  independent from fossil energies  in order to be safe  not to be threatened by the fuel gauge. I had no idea how it was possible. I just thought it's a dream and I want to do it. And when the capsule of my balloon was introduced officially in the Air and Space Museum in Washington  together with the airplane of Charles Lindbergh  with Apollo     with the Wright Brothers' Flyer  with Chuck Yeager's     I had really a thought then. I thought  well  the   th century  that was brilliant. It allowed to do all those things there. But it will not be possible in the future any more. It takes too much energy. It will cost too much. It will be prohibited because we'll have to save our natural resources in a few decades from now. So how can we perpetuate this pioneering spirit with something that will be independent from fossil energy  And this is when the project Solar Impulse really started to turn in my head. And I think it's a nice metaphor also for the   st century. Pioneering spirit should continue  but on another level. Not to conquer the planet or space  not anymore  it has been done  but rather to improve the quality of life. How can we go through the ice of certainty in order to make the most incredible a possible thing  What is today completely impossible    get rid of our dependency on fossil energy. If you tell to people  we want to be independent from fossil energy in our world  people will laugh at you  except here  where crazy people are invited to speak. So  the idea is that if we fly around the world in a solar powered airplane  using absolutely no fuel  nobody ever could say in the future that it's impossible to do it for cars  for heating systems  for computers  and so on and so on. Well  solar power airplanes are not new. They have flown in the past  but without saving capabilities  without batteries. Which means that they have more proven the limits of renewable energies than the potential of it. If we want to show the potential  we have to fly day and night. That means to load the batteries during the flight  in order to spend the night on the batteries  and fly the next day again. It has been made  already  on remote controlled little airplane models  without pilots. But it stays an anecdote because the public couldn't identify to it. I think you need a pilot in the plane that can talk to the universities  that can talk to students  talk to politicians during the flight  and really make it a human adventure. For that  unfortunately  four meters wingspan is not enough. You need    meter wingspan.    meter wingspan to carry one pilot  the batteries  flies slowly enough with the aerodynamic efficiency. Why that  Because fuel is not easy to replace. That's for sure. And with     square meters of solar power on our plane  we can produce the same energy than     little lightbulbs. That means a Christmas tree  a big Christmas tree. So the question is  how can you carry a pilot around the world with an airplane that uses the same amount of energy as a big Christmas tree  People will tell you it's impossible  and that's exactly why we try to do it. We launched the project with my colleague Andre Borschberg six years ago. We have now    people in the team working on it. We have gone through the stages of simulation  design  computing  preparing the construction of the first prototype. That has been achieved after two years of work. Cockpit  propeller  engine. Just the fuselage here  it's so light. It's not designed by an artist  but it could be.    kilos for the entire fuselage. Couple of kilos more for the wing spars. This is the complete structure of the airplane. And one month ago we have unveiled it. You cannot imagine how it is for a team who has been working six years on it to show that it's not only a dream and a vision  it's a real airplane. A real airplane that we could finally present. And what's the goal now  The goal is to take off  end of this year for the first test  but mainly next year  spring or summer  take off  on our own power  without additional help  without being towed  climb to       meters altitude. The same time we load the batteries  we run the engines  and when we get at the maximum height  we arrive at the beginning of the night. And there  there will be just one goal  just one  reach the next sunrise before the batteries are empty. And this is exactly the symbol of our world. If our airplane is too heavy  if the pilot wastes energy  we'll never make it through the night. And in our world  if we keep on spoiling  wasting our energy resources  if we keep on building things that consume so much energy that most of the companies now go bankrupt  it's clear that we'll never give the planet to the next generation without a major problem. So  you see that this airplane is more a symbol. I don't think it will transport     people in the next years. But when Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic  the payload was also just sufficient for one person and some fuel. And    years later there were     people in every airplane crossing the Atlantic. So  we have to start  and show the example. A little bit like on this picture here. This is a painting from Magritte  in the museum in Holland that I love so much. It's a pipe  and it's written   This is not a pipe.  This is not an airplane. This is a symbol of what we can achieve when we believe in the impossible  when we have a team  when we have pioneering spirit  and especially when we understand that all the certainties we have should be thrown overboard. What pleases me very much is that in the beginning I thought that we would have to fly around the world with no fuel in order to have our message been understood. And more and more  we're invited around the world with Andre to talk about that project  to talk about the symbol of it  invited by politicians  invited in energy forums  in order to show that it's not anymore completely stupid to think about getting rid of the dependency on fossil energies. So  through speeches like this one today  through interviews  through meetings  our goal is to get as many people possible on the team. The success will not come if we  just   quote  unquote  fly around the world in a solar powered airplane. No  the success will come if enough people are motivated to do exactly the same in their daily life  save energy  go to renewables. And this is possible. You know  with the technologies we have today  we can save between    and    percent of the energy of a country in Europe  and we can solve half of the rest with renewables. It leaves    or    percent for oil  gas  coal  nuclear  or whatever. This is acceptable. This is why all the people who believe in this type of spirit are welcome to be on that team. You can just go on SolarImpulse.com  subscribe to just be informed of what we're doing. But much more  to get advices  to give your comments  to spread the word that if it's possible in the air  of course it's possible in the ground. And each time we have some ice in the future  we have to know that life will be great  and the success will be brilliant if we dare to overcome our fear of the ice  to go through the obstacle  to go through the problem  in order to see what there is on the other side. So  you see  this is what we're doing on our side. Everyone has his goal  has his dreams  has his visions. The question I leave you with now is which is the ballast you would like to throw overboard  Which will be the altitude at which you would like to fly in your life  to get to the success that you wish to have  to get to the point that really belongs to you  with the potential you have  and the one you can really fulfill  Because the most renewable energy we have is our own potential  and our own passion. So  let's go for it  and I wish you an excellent adventure in the wings of the future. Thank you. I'd like to talk to you today about the human brain  which is what we do research on at the University of California. Just think about this problem for a second. Here is a lump of flesh  about three pounds  which you can hold in the palm of your hand. But it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space. It can contemplate the meaning of infinity  ask questions about the meaning of its own existence  about the nature of God. And this is truly the most amazing thing in the world. It's the greatest mystery confronting human beings  How does this all come about  Well  the brain  as you know  is made up of neurons. We're looking at neurons here. There are     billion neurons in the adult human brain. And each neuron makes something like       to        contacts with other neurons in the brain. And based on this  people have calculated that the number of permutations and combinations of brain activity exceeds the number of elementary particles in the universe. So  how do you go about studying the brain  One approach is to look at patients who had lesions in different part of the brain  and study changes in their behavior. This is what I spoke about in the last TED. Today I'll talk about a different approach  which is to put electrodes in different parts of the brain  and actually record the activity of individual nerve cells in the brain. Sort of eavesdrop on the activity of nerve cells in the brain. Now  one recent discovery that has been made by researchers in Italy  in Parma  by Giacomo Rizzolatti and his colleagues  is a group of neurons called mirror neurons  which are on the front of the brain in the frontal lobes. Now  it turns out there are neurons which are called ordinary motor command neurons in the front of the brain  which have been known for over    years. These neurons will fire when a person performs a specific action. For example  if I do that  and reach and grab an apple  a motor command neuron in the front of my brain will fire. If I reach out and pull an object  another neuron will fire  commanding me to pull that object. These are called motor command neurons that have been known for a long time. But what Rizzolatti found was a subset of these neurons  maybe about    percent of them  will also fire when I'm looking at somebody else performing the same action. So  here is a neuron that fires when I reach and grab something  but it also fires when I watch Joe reaching and grabbing something. And this is truly astonishing. Because it's as though this neuron is adopting the other person's point of view. It's almost as though it's performing a virtual reality simulation of the other person's action. Now  what is the significance of these mirror neurons  For one thing they must be involved in things like imitation and emulation. Because to imitate a complex act requires my brain to adopt the other person's point of view. So  this is important for imitation and emulation. Well  why is that important  Well  let's take a look at the next slide. So  how do you do imitation  Why is imitation important  Mirror neurons and imitation  emulation. Now  let's look at culture  the phenomenon of human culture. If you go back in time about          to         years ago  let's look at human evolution  it turns out that something very important happened around        years ago. And that is  there is a sudden emergence and rapid spread of a number of skills that are unique to human beings like tool use  the use of fire  the use of shelters  and  of course  language  and the ability to read somebody else's mind and interpret that person's behavior. All of that happened relatively quickly. Even though the human brain had achieved its present size almost three or four hundred thousand years ago          years ago all of this happened very  very quickly. And I claim that what happened was the sudden emergence of a sophisticated mirror neuron system  which allowed you to emulate and imitate other people's actions. So that when there was a sudden accidental discovery by one member of the group  say the use of fire  or a particular type of tool  instead of dying out  this spread rapidly  horizontally across the population  or was transmitted vertically  down the generations. So  this made evolution suddenly Lamarckian  instead of Darwinian. Darwinian evolution is slow  it takes hundreds of thousands of years. A polar bear  to evolve a coat  will take thousands of generations  maybe         years. A human being  a child  can just watch its parent kill another polar bear  and skin it and put the skin on its body  fur on the body  and learn it in one step. What the polar bear took         years to learn  it can learn in five minutes  maybe    minutes. And then once it's learned this it spreads in geometric proportion across a population. This is the basis. The imitation of complex skills is what we call culture and is the basis of civilization. Now there is another kind of mirror neuron  which is involved in something quite different. And that is  there are mirror neurons  just as there are mirror neurons for action  there are mirror neurons for touch. In other words  if somebody touches me  my hand  neuron in the somatosensory cortex in the sensory region of the brain fires. But the same neuron  in some cases  will fire when I simply watch another person being touched. So  it's empathizing the other person being touched. So  most of them will fire when I'm touched in different locations. Different neurons for different locations. But a subset of them will fire even when I watch somebody else being touched in the same location. So  here again you have neurons which are enrolled in empathy. Now  the question then arises  If I simply watch another person being touched  why do I not get confused and literally feel that touch sensation merely by watching somebody being touched  I mean  I empathize with that person but I don't literally feel the touch. Well  that's because you've got receptors in your skin  touch and pain receptors  going back into your brain and saying  Don't worry  you're not being touched. So  empathize  by all means  with the other person  but do not actually experience the touch  otherwise you'll get confused and muddled.  Okay  so there is a feedback signal that vetoes the signal of the mirror neuron preventing you from consciously experiencing that touch. But if you remove the arm  you simply anesthetize my arm  so you put an injection into my arm  anesthetize the brachial plexus  so the arm is numb  and there is no sensations coming in  if I now watch you being touched  I literally feel it in my hand. In other words  you have dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings. So  I call them Gandhi neurons  or empathy neurons. And this is not in some abstract metaphorical sense. All that's separating you from him  from the other person  is your skin. Remove the skin  you experience that person's touch in your mind. You've dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings. And this  of course  is the basis of much of Eastern philosophy  and that is there is no real independent self  aloof from other human beings  inspecting the world  inspecting other people. You are  in fact  connected not just via Facebook and Internet  you're actually quite literally connected by your neurons. And there is whole chains of neurons around this room  talking to each other. And there is no real distinctiveness of your consciousness from somebody else's consciousness. And this is not mumbo jumbo philosophy. It emerges from our understanding of basic neuroscience. So  you have a patient with a phantom limb. If the arm has been removed and you have a phantom  and you watch somebody else being touched  you feel it in your phantom. Now the astonishing thing is  if you have pain in your phantom limb  you squeeze the other person's hand  massage the other person's hand  that relieves the pain in your phantom hand  almost as though the neuron were obtaining relief from merely watching somebody else being massaged. So  here you have my last slide. For the longest time people have regarded science and humanities as being distinct. C.P. Snow spoke of the two cultures  science on the one hand  humanities on the other  never the twain shall meet. So  I'm saying the mirror neuron system underlies the interface allowing you to rethink about issues like consciousness  representation of self  what separates you from other human beings  what allows you to empathize with other human beings  and also even things like the emergence of culture and civilization  which is unique to human beings. Thank you. So      years ago  Dr. R ntgen X rayed his wife's hand. Quite why he had to pin her fingers to the floor with her brooch  I'm not sure. It seems a bit extreme to me. That image was the start of the X ray technology. And I'm still fundamentally using the same principles today. I'm interpreting it in a more contemporary manner. The first shot I ever did was of a soda can  which was to promote a brand that we all know  so I'm not going to do them any favors by showing you it. But the second shot I did was my shoes I was wearing on the day. And I do really like this shot  because it shows all the detritus that's sort of embedded in the sole of the sneakers. It was just one of those pot luck things where you get it right first time. Moving on to something a bit larger  this is an X ray of a bus. And the bus is full of people. It's actually the same person. It's just one skeleton. And back in the '  s  they used to teach student radiographers to take X rays  thankfully not on you and I  but on dead people. So  I've still got access to one of these dead people called Frieda  she's falling apart  I'm afraid  because she's very old and fragile. But everyone on that bus is Frieda. And the bus is taken with a cargo scanning X ray  which is the sort of machine you have on borders  which checks for contraband and drugs and bombs and things. Fairly obvious what that is. So  using large scale objects does sort of create drama because you just don't see X rays of big things that often. Technology is moving ahead  and these large cargo scanner X rays that work with the digital system are getting better and better and better. Again though  to make it come alive you need  somehow  to add the human element. And I think the reason this image works  again  is because Frieda is driving the bulldozer. Quite a difficult brief  make a pair of men's pants look beautiful. But I think the process  in itself  shows how exquisite they are. Fashion    now  I'm sort of anti fashion because I don't show the surface  I show what's within. So  the fashionistas don't really like me because it doesn't matter if Kate Moss is wearing it or if I'm wearing it  it looks the same. We all look the same inside  believe me. The creases in the material and the sort of nuances. And I show things for really what they are  what they're made of. I peel back the layers and expose it. And if it's well made I show it  if it's badly made I show it. And I'm sure Ross can associate that with design. The design comes from within. It's not just Topshop  I get some strange looks when I go out getting my props. Here I was fumbling around in the ladies' underwear department of a department store  almost got escorted from the premises. I live opposite a farm. And this was the runt of the litter  a piglet that died. And what's really interesting is  if you look at the legs  you'll notice that the bones haven't fused. And should that pig have grown  unfortunately it was dead  it would have certainly been dead after I X rayed it  with the amount of radiation I used anyway. But once the bones had fused together it would have been healthy. So  that's an empty parka jacket. But I quite love the way it's posed. Nature is my greatest inspiration. And to carry on with a theme that we've already touched with is how nature is related to architecture. If you look at the roof of the Eden Project  or the British library  it's all this honeycomb structure. And I'm sure those architects are inspired  as I am  by what surrounds us  by nature. This  in fact  is a Victoria water lily leaf that floats on the top of a pond. An amaryllis flower looking really three dimensional. Seaweed  ebbing in the tide. Now  how do I do this  and where do I do this  and all of that sort of thing. This is my new  purpose built  X ray shed. And the door to my X ray room is made of lead and steel. It weighs       kilograms and the only exercise I get is opening and closing it. The walls are     millimeters thick of solid dense concrete. So  I'm using quite a lot of radiation. A lot more than you'd get in a hospital or a vet's. And there I am. This is a quite high powered X ray machine. What's interesting really about X ray really is  if you think about it  is that that technology is used for looking for cancer or looking for drugs  or looking for contraband or whatever. And I use that sort of technology to create things that are quite beautiful. So  still working with film  I'm afraid. Technology in X ray where it's life size processed  apart from these large cargo scanning machines  hasn't moved on enough for the quality of the image and the resolution to be good enough for what I want to do with it  which is show my pictures big. So  I have to use a     s drum scanner  which was designed in the days when everyone shot photographs on film. They scan each individual X ray. And this shows how I do my process of same size X rays. So  this is  again  my daughter's dress. Still has the tag in it from me buying it  so I can take it back to the shop if she didn't like it. But there are four X ray plates. You can see them overlapping. So  when you move forward from something fairly small  a dress which is this size  onto something like that which is done in exactly the same process  you can see that that is a lot of work. In fact  that is three months solid X raying. There is over     separate components. Boeing sent me a     in containers. And I sent them back an X ray. Okay  so Frieda is my dead skeleton. This  unfortunately  is basically two pictures. One on the extreme right is a photograph of an American footballer. The one on the left is an x ray. But this time I had to use a real body. Because I needed all the skin tissue to make it look real  to make it look like it was a real athlete. So  here I had to use a recently deceased body. And getting a hold of that was extremely difficult and laborious. But people do donate their bodies to art and science. And when they do  I'm in the queue. So  I like to use them. The coloring  so coloring adds another level to the X rays. It makes it more organic  more natural. It's whatever takes my fancy  really. It's not accurately colored to how it is in real life. That flower doesn't come in bright orange  I don't think. But I just like it in bright orange. And also with something technical  like these are DJ decks  it sort of adds another level. It makes a two dimensional image look more three dimensional. The most difficult things to X ray  the most technically challenging things to X ray are the lightest things  the most delicate things. To get the detail in a feather  believe me  if there is anyone out here who knows anything about X rays  that's quite a challenge. I'm now going to show you a short film  I'll step to the side. Video   Music  The thing in there is very dangerous. If you touch that  you could possibly die through radiation poisoning. In my career I've had two exposures to radiation  which is two too many  because it stays with you for life. It's cumulative. It has human connotations. The fact that it's a child's toy that we all recognize  but also it looks like it's a robot  and it comes from a sci fi genus. It's a surprise that it has humanity  but also man made  future  alien associations. And it's just a bit spooky. The bus was done with a cargo scanning X ray machine  which is used on the borders between countries  looking for contraband and illegal immigrants. The lorry goes in front of it. And it takes slices of X rays through the lorry. And that's how this was done. It's actually slice  slice. It's a bit like a CT scanner in a hospital. Slices. And then if you look carefully  there is all little things. He's got headphones on  reading the newspaper  got a hat on  glasses  got a bag. So  these little details help to make it work  make it real. The problem with using living people is that to take an X ray  if I X ray you  you get exposed to radiation. So  to avoid that    I have to avoid it somehow    is I use dead people. Now  that's a variety of things  from recently deceased bodies  to a skeleton that was used by student radiographers to train in taking X rays of the human body  at different densities. I have very high tech equipment of gloves  scissors and a bucket. I will show how the capillary action works  how it feeds  I'll be able to get all the cells inside that stem. Because it transfers food from its roots to its leaves. Look at this monster. It's so basic. It just grows wild. That's what I really like about it  the fact that I haven't got to go and buy it  and it hasn't been genetically modified at all. It's just happening. And the X ray shows how beautiful nature can be. Not that that is particularly beautiful when you look at it with the human eye  the way the leaves form. They're curling back on each other. So the X ray will show the overlaps in these little corners. The thicker the object  the more radiation it needs  and the more time it needs. The lighter the object  the less radiation. Sometimes you keep the time up  because the time gives you detail. The longer the exposure goes on for  the more detail you get. If you look at this  just the tube  it is quite bright. But I could get a bit darker in the tube  but everything else would suffer. So  these leaves at the edge would start to disappear. What I like is how hard the edges are  how sharp. Yeah  I'm quite pleased with it. I travel beyond the surface and show something for what it's worth  for what it's really made of  how it really works. But also I find that I've got the benefit of taking away all the surface  which is things that people are used to seeing. And that's the sort of thing I've been doing. I've got the opportunity now to show you what I'm going to be doing in the future. This is a commercial application of my most recent work. And what's good about this  I think  is that it's like a moment in time  like you've turned around  you've got X ray vision and you've taken a picture with the X ray camera. Unfortunately I haven't got X ray vision. I do dream in X ray. I see my projects in my sleep. And I know what they're going to look like in X ray and I'm not far off. So  what am I doing in the future  Well  this year is the   th anniversary of Issigonis's Mini  which is one of my favorite cars. So  I've taken it apart  component by component  months and months and months of work. And with this image  I'm going to be displaying it in the Victoria and Albert Museum as a light box  which is actually attached to the car. So  I've got to saw the car in half  down the middle  not an easy task  in itself. And then  so you can get in the driver's side  sit down  and up against you is a wall. And if you get out and walk around to the other side of the car  you see a life sized light box of the car showing you how it works. And I'm going to take that idea and apply it to other sort of iconic things from my life. Like  my first computer was a big movement in my life. And I had a Mac Classic. And it's a little box. And I think that would look quite neat as an X ray. I'm also looking to take my work from the two dimensional form to a more three dimensional form. And this is quite a good way of doing it. I'm also working now with X ray video. So  if you can imagine  some of these flowers  and they're actually moving and growing and you can film that in X ray  should be quite stunning. But that's it. I'm done. Thank you very much. Something called the Danish Twin Study established that only about    percent of how long the average person lives  within certain biological limits  is dictated by our genes. The other    percent is dictated by our lifestyle. So the premise of Blue Zones  if we can find the optimal lifestyle of longevity we can come up with a de facto formula for longevity. But if you ask the average American what the optimal formula of longevity is  they probably couldn't tell you. They've probably heard of the South Beach Diet  or the Atkins Diet. You have the USDA food pyramid. There is what Oprah tells us. There is what Doctor Oz tells us. The fact of the matter is there is a lot of confusion around what really helps us live longer better. Should you be running marathons or doing yoga  Should you eat organic meats or should you be eating tofu  When it comes to supplements  should you be taking them  How about these hormones or resveratrol  And does purpose play into it  Spirituality  And how about how we socialize  Well  our approach to finding longevity was to team up with National Geographic  and the National Institute on Aging  to find the four demographically confirmed areas that are geographically defined. And then bring a team of experts in there to methodically go through exactly what these people do  to distill down the cross cultural distillation. And at the end of this I'm going to tell you what that distillation is. But first I'd like to debunk some common myths when it comes to longevity. And the first myth is if you try really hard you can live to be    . False. The problem is  only about one out of       people in America live to be    . Your chances are very low. Even though it's the fastest growing demographic in America  it's hard to reach    . The problem is that we're not programmed for longevity. We are programmed for something called procreative success. I love that word. It reminds me of my college days. Biologists term procreative success to mean the age where you have children and then another generation  the age when your children have children. After that the effect of evolution completely dissipates. If you're a mammal  if you're a rat or an elephant  or a human  in between  it's the same story. So to make it to age      you not only have to have had a very good lifestyle  you also have to have won the genetic lottery. The second myth is  there are treatments that can help slow  reverse  or even stop aging. False. When you think of it  there is    things that can age us. Deprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes  those brain cells die  they never come back. Play tennis too hard  on your knees  ruin your cartilage  the cartilage never comes back. Our arteries can clog. Our brains can gunk up with plaque  and we can get Alzheimer's. There is just too many things to go wrong. Our bodies have    trillion cells  trillion with a  T.  We're talking national debt numbers here. Those cells turn themselves over once every eight years. And every time they turn themselves over there is some damage. And that damage builds up. And it builds up exponentially. It's a little bit like the days when we all had Beatles albums or Eagles albums and we'd make a copy of that on a cassette tape  and let our friends copy that cassette tape  and pretty soon  with successive generations that tape sounds like garbage. Well  the same things happen to our cells. That's why a    year old person is aging at a rate of about     times faster than a    year old person. So  if there is nothing you can do to slow your aging or stop your aging  what am I doing here  Well  the fact of the matter is the best science tells us that the capacity of the human body  my body  your body  is about    years  a little bit more for women. But life expectancy in this country is only   . So somewhere along the line  we're leaving about    good years on the table. These are years that we could get. And research shows that they would be years largely free of chronic disease  heart disease  cancer and diabetes. We think the best way to get these missing years is to look at the cultures around the world that are actually experiencing them  areas where people are living to age     at rates up to    times greater than we are  areas where the life expectancy is an extra dozen years  the rate of middle age mortality is a fraction of what it is in this country. We found our first Blue Zone about     miles off the coast of Italy  on the island of Sardinia. And not the entire island  the island is about  .  million people  but only up in the highlands  an area called the Nuoro province. And here we have this area where men live the longest  about    times more centenarians than we have here in America. And this is a place where people not only reach age      they do so with extraordinary vigor. Places where     year olds still ride their bike to work  chop wood  and can beat a guy    years younger than them. Their history actually goes back to about the time of Christ. It's actually a Bronze Age culture that's been isolated. Because the land is so infertile  they largely are shepherds  which occasions regular  low intensity physical activity. Their diet is mostly plant based  accentuated with foods that they can carry into the fields. They came up with an unleavened whole wheat bread called carta musica made out of durum wheat  a type of cheese made from grass fed animals so the cheese is high in Omega   fatty acids instead of Omega   fatty acids from corn fed animals  and a type of wine that has three times the level of polyphenols than any known wine in the world. It's called Cannonau. But the real secret I think lies more in the way that they organize their society. And one of the most salient elements of the Sardinian society is how they treat older people. You ever notice here in America  social equity seems to peak at about age     Just look at the advertisements. Here in Sardinia  the older you get the more equity you have  the more wisdom you're celebrated for. You go into the bars in Sardinia  instead of seeing the Sports Illustrated swimsuit calendar  you see the centenarian of the month calendar. This  as it turns out  is not only good for your aging parents to keep them close to the family    it imparts about four to six years of extra life expectancy    research shows it's also good for the children of those families  who have lower rates of mortality and lower rates of disease. That's called the grandmother effect. We found our second Blue Zone on the other side of the planet  about     miles south of Tokyo  on the archipelago of Okinawa. Okinawa is actually     small islands. And in the northern part of the main island  this is ground zero for world longevity. This is a place where the oldest living female population is found. It's a place where people have the longest disability free life expectancy in the world. They have what we want. They live a long time  and tend to die in their sleep  very quickly  and often  I can tell you  after sex. They live about seven good years longer than the average American. Five times as many centenarians as we have in America. One fifth the rate of colon and breast cancer  big killers here in America. And one sixth the rate of cardiovascular disease. And the fact that this culture has yielded these numbers suggests strongly they have something to teach us. What do they do  Once again  a plant based diet  full of vegetables with lots of color in them. And they eat about eight times as much tofu as Americans do. More significant than what they eat is how they eat it. They have all kinds of little strategies to keep from overeating  which  as you know  is a big problem here in America. A few of the strategies we observed  they eat off of smaller plates  so they tend to eat fewer calories at every sitting. Instead of serving family style  where you can sort of mindlessly eat as you're talking  they serve at the counter  put the food away  and then bring it to the table. They also have a       year old adage  which I think is the greatest sort of diet suggestion ever invented. It was invented by Confucius. And that diet is known as the Hara  Hatchi  Bu diet. It's simply a little saying these people say before their meal to remind them to stop eating when their stomach is      percent full. It takes about a half hour for that full feeling to travel from your belly to your brain. And by remembering to stop at    percent it helps keep you from doing that very thing. But  like Sardinia  Okinawa has a few social constructs that we can associate with longevity. We know that isolation kills. Fifteen years ago  the average American had three good friends. We're down to one and half right now. If you were lucky enough to be born in Okinawa  you were born into a system where you automatically have a half a dozen friends with whom you travel through life. They call it a Moai. And if you're in a Moai you're expected to share the bounty if you encounter luck  and if things go bad  child gets sick  parent dies  you always have somebody who has your back. This particular Moai  these five ladies have been together for    years. Their average age is    . Typically in America we've divided our adult life up into two sections. There is our work life  where we're productive. And then one day  boom  we retire. And typically that has meant retiring to the easy chair  or going down to Arizona to play golf. In the Okinawan language there is not even a word for retirement. Instead there is one word that imbues your entire life  and that word is  ikigai.  And  roughly translated  it means  the reason for which you wake up in the morning.  For this     year old karate master  his ikigai was carrying forth this martial art. For this hundred year old fisherman it was continuing to catch fish for his family three times a week. And this is a question. The National Institute on Aging actually gave us a questionnaire to give these centenarians. And one of the questions  they were very culturally astute  the people who put the questionnaire. One of the questions was   What is your ikigai   They instantly knew why they woke up in the morning. For this     year old woman  her ikigai was simply her great great great granddaughter. Two girls separated in age by     and a half years. And I asked her what it felt like to hold a great great great granddaughter. And she put her head back and she said   It feels like leaping into heaven.  I thought that was a wonderful thought. My editor at Geographic wanted me to find America's Blue Zone. And for a while we looked on the prairies of Minnesota  where actually there is a very high proportion of centenarians. But that's because all the young people left. So  we turned to the data again. And we found America's longest lived population among the Seventh Day Adventists concentrated in and around Loma Linda  California. Adventists are conservative Methodists. They celebrate their Sabbath from sunset on Friday till sunset on Saturday. A     hour sanctuary in time   they call it. And they follow five little habits that conveys to them extraordinary longevity  comparatively speaking. In America here  life expectancy for the average woman is   . But for an Adventist woman  their life expectancy is   . And the difference is even more pronounced among men  who are expected to live about    years longer than their American counterparts. Now  this is a study that followed about        people for    years. Sterling study. And I think it supremely illustrates the premise of this Blue Zone project. This is a heterogeneous community. It's white  black  Hispanic  Asian. The only thing that they have in common are a set of very small lifestyle habits that they follow ritualistically for most of their lives. They take their diet directly from the Bible. Genesis  Chapter one  Verse       where God talks about legumes and seeds  and on one more stanza about green plants  ostensibly missing is meat. They take this sanctuary in time very serious. For    hours every week  no matter how busy they are  how stressed out they are at work  where the kids need to be driven  they stop everything and they focus on their God  their social network  and then  hardwired right in the religion  are nature walks. And the power of this is not that it's done occasionally  the power is it's done every week for a lifetime. None of it's hard. None of it costs money. Adventists also tend to hang out with other Adventists. So  if you go to an Adventist's party you don't see people swilling Jim Beam or rolling a joint. Instead they're talking about their next nature walk  exchanging recipes  and yes  they pray. But they influence each other in profound and measurable ways. This is a culture that has yielded Ellsworth Whareham. Ellsworth Whareham is    years old. He's a multimillionaire  yet when a contractor wanted       dollars to build a privacy fence  he said   For that kind of money I'll do it myself.  So for the next three days he was out shoveling cement  and hauling poles around. And predictably  perhaps  on the fourth day he ended up in the operating room. But not as the guy on the table  the guy doing open heart surgery. At    he still does    open heart surgeries every month. Ed Rawlings      years old now  an active cowboy  starts his morning with a swim. And on weekends he likes to put on the boards  throw up rooster tails. And then Marge Deton. Marge is    . Her grandson actually lives in the Twin Cities here. She starts her day with lifting weights. She rides her bicycle. And then she gets in her root beer colored      Cadillac Seville  and tears down the San Bernardino freeway  where she still volunteers for seven different organizations. I've been on    hardcore expeditions. I'm probably the only person you'll ever meet who rode his bicycle across the Sahara desert without sunscreen. But I'll tell you  there is no adventure more harrowing than riding shotgun with Marge Deton.  A stranger is a friend I haven't met yet   she'd say to me. So  what are the common denominators in these three cultures  What are the things that they all do  And we managed to boil it down to nine. In fact we've done two more Blue Zone expeditions since this and these common denominators hold true. And the first one  and I'm about to utter a heresy here  none of them exercise  at least the way we think of exercise. Instead  they set up their lives so that they are constantly nudged into physical activity. These     year old Okinawan women are getting up and down off the ground  they sit on the floor     or    times a day. Sardinians live in vertical houses  up and down the stairs. Every trip to the store  or to church or to a friend's house occasions a walk. They don't have any conveniences. There is not a button to push to do yard work or house work. If they want to mix up a cake  they're doing it by hand. That's physical activity. That burns calories just as much as going on the treadmill does. When they do do intentional physical activity  it's the things they enjoy. They tend to walk  the only proven way to stave off cognitive decline  and they all tend to have a garden. They know how to set up their life in the right way so they have the right outlook. Each of these cultures take time to downshift. The Sardinians pray. The Seventh Day Adventists pray. The Okinawans have this ancestor veneration. But when you're in a hurry or stressed out  that triggers something called the inflammatory response  which is associated with everything from Alzheimer's disease to cardiovascular disease. When you slow down for    minutes a day you turn that inflammatory state into a more anti inflammatory state. They have vocabulary for sense of purpose  ikigai  like the Okinawans. You know the two most dangerous years in your life are the year you're born  because of infant mortality  and the year you retire. These people know their sense of purpose  and they activate in their life  that's worth about seven years of extra life expectancy. There's no longevity diet. Instead  these people drink a little bit every day  not a hard sell to the American population. They tend to eat a plant based diet. Doesn't mean they don't eat meat  but lots of beans and nuts. And they have strategies to keep from overeating  little things that nudge them away from the table at the right time. And then the foundation of all this is how they connect. They put their families first  take care of their children and their aging parents. They all tend to belong to a faith based community  which is worth between four and    extra years of life expectancy if you do it four times a month. And the biggest thing here is they also belong to the right tribe. They were either born into or they proactively surrounded themselves with the right people. We know from the Framingham studies  that if your three best friends are obese there is a    percent better chance that you'll be overweight. So  if you hang out with unhealthy people  that's going to have a measurable impact over time. Instead  if your friend's idea of recreation is physical activity  bowling  or playing hockey  biking or gardening  if your friends drink a little  but not too much  and they eat right  and they're engaged  and they're trusting and trustworthy  that is going to have the biggest impact over time. Diets don't work. No diet in the history of the world has ever worked for more than two percent of the population. Exercise programs usually start in January  they're usually done by October. When it comes to longevity there is no short term fix in a pill or anything else. But when you think about it  your friends are long term adventures  and therefore  perhaps the most significant thing you can do to add more years to your life  and life to your years. Thank you very much. I want you to put off your preconceptions  your preconceived fears and thoughts about reptiles. Because that is the only way I'm going to get my story across to you. And by the way  if I come across as a sort of rabid  hippie conservationist  it's purely a figment of your imagination. Okay. We are actually the first species on Earth to be so prolific to actually threaten our own survival. And I know we've all seen images enough to make us numb  of the tragedies that we're perpetrating on the planet. We're kind of like greedy kids  using it all up  aren't we  And today is a time for me to talk to you about water. It's not only because we like to drink lots of it  and its marvelous derivatives  beer  wine  etc. And  of course  watch it fall from the sky and flow in our wonderful rivers  but for several other reasons as well. When I was a kid  growing up in New York  I was smitten by snakes  the same way most kids are smitten by tops  marbles  cars  trains  cricket balls. And my mother  brave lady  was partly to blame  taking me to the New York Natural History Museum  buying me books on snakes  and then starting this infamous career of mine  which has culminated in of course  arriving in India    years ago  brought by my mother  Doris Norden  and my stepfather  Rama Chattopadhyaya. It's been a roller coaster ride. Two animals  two iconic reptiles really captivated me very early on. One of them was the remarkable gharial. This crocodile  which grows to almost    feet long in the northern rivers  and this charismatic snake  the king cobra. What my purpose of the talk today really is  is to sort of indelibly scar your minds with these charismatic and majestic creatures. Because this is what you will take away from here  a reconnection with nature  I hope. The king cobra is quite remarkable for several reasons. What you're seeing here is very recently shot images in a forest nearby here  of a female king cobra making her nest. Here is a limbless animal  capable of gathering a huge mound of leaves  and then laying her eggs inside  to withstand   to     meters of rainfall   in order that the eggs can incubate over the next    days  and hatch into little baby king cobras. So  she protects her eggs  and after three months  the babies finally do hatch out. A majority of them will die  of course. There is very high mortality in little baby reptiles who are just    to    inches long. My first experience with king cobras was in '   at a magical place called Agumbe  in Karnataka  this state. And it is a marvelous rain forest. This first encounter was kind of like the Maasai boy who kills the lion to become a warrior. It really changed my life totally. And it brought me straight into the conservation fray. I ended up starting this research and education station in Agumbe  which you are all of course invited to visit. This is basically a base wherein we are trying to gather and learn virtually everything about the biodiversity of this incredibly complex forest system  and try to hang on to what's there  make sure the water sources are protected and kept clean  and of course  having a good time too. You can almost hear the drums throbbing back in that little cottage where we stay when we're there. It was very important for us to get through to the people. And through the children is usually the way to go. They are fascinated with snakes. They haven't got that steely thing that you end up either fearing or hating or despising or loathing them in some way. They are interested. And it really works to start with them. This gives you an idea of the size of some of these snakes. This is an average size king cobra  about    feet long. And it actually crawled into somebody's bathroom  and was hanging around there for two or three days. The people of this part of India worship the king cobra. And they didn't kill it. They called us to catch it. Now we've caught more than     king cobras over the last three years  and relocated them in nearby forests. But in order to find out the real secrets of these creatures  it was necessary  for us to actually insert a small radio transmitter inside  each  snake. Now we are able to follow them and find out their secrets  where the babies go after they hatch  and remarkable things like this you're about to see. This was just a few days ago in Agumbe. I had the pleasure of being close to this large king cobra who had caught a venomous pit viper. And it does it in such a way that it doesn't get bitten itself. And king cobras feed only on snakes. This  little snake  was kind of a tid bit for it  what we'd call a  vadai  or a donut or something like that. Usually they eat something a bit larger. In this case a rather strange and inexplicable activity happened over the last breeding season  wherein a large male king cobra actually grabbed a female king cobra  didn't mate with it  actually killed it and swallowed it. We're still trying to explain and come to terms with what is the evolutionary advantage of this. But they do also a lot of other remarkable things. This is again  something  we were able to see  by virtue of the fact that we had a radio transmitter in one of the snakes. This male snake     feet long  met another male king cobra. And they did this incredible ritual combat dance. It's very much like the rutting of mammals  including humans  you know  sorting out our differences  but gentler  no biting allowed. It's just a wresting match  but a remarkable activity. Now  what are we doing with all this information  What's the point of all this  Well  the king cobra is literally a keystone species in these rainforests. And our job is to convince the authorities that these forests have to be protected. And this is one of the ways we do it  by learning as much as we can about something so remarkable and so iconic in the rainforests there  in order to help protect trees  animals and of course the water sources. You've all heard  perhaps  of Project Tiger which started back in the early '  s  which was  in fact  a very dynamic time for conservation. We were piloted  I could say  by a highly autocratic stateswoman  but who also had an incredible passion for environment. And this is the time when Project Tiger emerged. And  just like Project Tiger  our activities with the king cobra is to look at a species of animal so that we protect its habitat and everything within it. So  the tiger is the icon. And now the king cobra is a new one. All the major rivers in south India are sourced in the Western Ghats  the chain of hills running along the west coast of India. It pours out millions of gallons every hour  and supplies drinking water to at least     million people  and washes many  many babies  and of course feeds many  many animals  both domestic and wild  produces thousands of tons of rice. And what do we do  How do we respond to this  Well  basically  we dam it  we pollute it  we pour in pesticides  weedicides  fungicides. You drink it in peril of your life. And the thing is  it's not just big industry. It's not misguided river engineers who are doing all this  it's us. It seems that our citizens find the best way to dispose of garbage are in water sources. Okay. Now we're going north  very far north. North central India  the Chambal River is where we have our base. This is the home of the gharial  this incredible crocodile. It is an animal which has been on the Earth for just about     million years. It survived even during the time that the dinosaurs died off. It has remarkable features. Even though it grows to    feet long  since it eats only fish it's not dangerous to human beings. It does have big teeth  however  and it's kind of hard to convince people if an animal has big teeth  that it's a harmless creature. But we  actually  back in the early '  s  did surveys  and found that gharial were extremely rare. In fact  if you see the map  the range of their original habitat was all the way from the Indus in Pakistan to the Irrawaddy in Burma. And now it's just limited to a couple of spots in Nepal and India. So  in fact at this point there are only     breeding gharial left in the wild. So  starting in the mid '  s when conservation was at the fore  we were actually able to start projects which were basically government supported to collect eggs from the wild from the few remaining nests and release       baby gharial back to the wild. And pretty soon we were seeing sights like this. I mean  just incredible to see bunches of gharial basking on the river again. But complacency does have a tendency to breed contempt. And  sure enough  with all the other pressures on the river  like sand mining  for example  very  very heavy cultivation all the way down to the river's edge  not allowing the animals to breed anymore  we're looking at even more problems building up for the gharial  despite the early good intentions. Their nests hatching along the riverside producing hundreds of hatchlings. It's just an amazing sight. This was actually just taken last year. But then the monsoon arrives  and unfortunately downriver there is always a dam or there is always a barrage  and  shoop  they get washed down to their doom. Luckily there is still a lot of interest. My pals in the Crocodile Specialist Group of the IUCN  the  Madras Crocodile Bank   an NGO  the World Wildlife Fund  the Wildlife Institute of India  State Forest Departments  and the Ministry of Environment  we all work together on stuff. But it's possibly  and definitely not enough. For example  in the winter of      and       there was this incredible die off of gharial  in the Chambal River. Suddenly dozens of gharial appearing on the river  dead. Why  How could it happen  This is a relatively clean river. The Chambal  if you look at it  has clear water. People scoop water out of the Chambal and drink it  something you wouldn't do in most north Indian rivers. So  in order to try to find out the answer to this  we got veterinarians from all over the world working with Indian vets to try to figure out what was happening. I was there for a lot of the necropsies on the riverside. And we actually looked through all their organs and tried to figure out what was going on. And it came down to something called gout  which  as a result of kidney breakdown is actually uric acid crystals throughout the body  and worse in the joints  which made the gharial unable to swim. And it's a horribly painful death. Just downriver from the Chambal is the filthy Yamuna river  the sacred Yamuna river. And I hate to be so ironic and sarcastic about it but it's the truth. It's just one of the filthiest cesspools you can imagine. It flows down through Delhi  Mathura  Agra  and gets just about every bit of effluent you can imagine. So  it seemed that the toxin that was killing the gharial was something in the food chain  something in the fish they were eating. And  you know  once a toxin is in the food chain everything is affected  including us. Because these rivers are the lifeblood of people all along their course. In order to try to answer some of these questions  we again turn to technology  to biological technology  in this case  again  telemetry  putting radios on    gharial  and actually following their movements. They're being watched everyday as we speak  to try to find out what this mysterious toxin is. The Chambal river is an absolutely incredible place. It's a place that's famous to a lot of you who know about the bandits  the dacoits who used to work up there. And there still are quite a few around. But Poolan Devi was one  of them . Which actually Shekhar Kapur made an incredible movie   The Bandit Queen   which I urge you to see. You'll get to see the incredible  Chambal  landscape as well. But  again  heavy fishing pressures. This is one of the last repositories of the Ganges river dolphin  various species of turtles  thousands of migratory birds  and fishing is causing problems like this. And now  these  new elements of human intolerance for river creatures like the gharial means that if they don't drown in the net  then they simply cut their beaks off. Animals like the Ganges river dolphin which is just down to a few left  and it is also critically endangered. So  who is next  Us  Because we are all dependent on these water sources. So  we all know about the Narmada river  the tragedies of dams  the tragedies of huge projects which displace people and wreck river systems without providing livelihoods. And development just basically going berserk  for a double figure growth index  basically. So  we're not sure where this story is going to end  whether it's got a happy or sad ending. And climate change is certainly going to turn all of our theories and predictions on their heads. We're still working hard at it. We've got a lot of a good team of people working up there. And the thing is  you know  the decision makers  the folks in power  they're up in their bungalows and so on in Delhi  in the city capitals. They are all supplied with plenty of water. It's cool. But out on the rivers there are still millions of people who are in really bad shape. And it's a bleak future for them. So  we have our Ganges and Yamuna cleanup project. We've spent hundreds of millions of dollars on it  and nothing to show for it. Incredible. So  people talk about political will. During the die off of the gharial we did galvanize a lot of action. Government cut through all the red tape  we got foreign vets on it. It was great. So  we can do it. But if you stroll down to the Yamuna or to the Gomati in Lucknow  or to the Adyar river in Chennai  or the Mula Mutha river in Pune  just see what we're capable of doing to a river. It's sad. But I think the final note really is that we can do it. The corporates  the artists  the wildlife nuts  the good old everyday folks can actually bring these rivers back. And the final word is that there is a king cobra looking over our shoulders. And there is a gharial looking at us from the river. And these are powerful water totems. And they are going to disturb our dreams until we do the right thing. Namaste. Chris Anderson  Thanks  Rom. Thanks a lot. You know  most people are terrified of snakes. And there might be quite a few people here who would be very glad to see the last king cobra bite the dust. Do you have those conversations with people  How do you really get them to care  Romulus Whitaker  I take the sort of humble approach  I guess you could say. I don't say that snakes are huggable exactly. It's not like the teddy bear. But I sort of    there is an innocence in these animals. And when the average person looks at a cobra going  Ssssss   like that  they say   My god  look at that angry  dangerous creature.  I look at it as a creature who is totally frightened of something so dangerous as a human being. And that is the truth. And that's what I try to get out. CA  Now  incredible footage you showed of the viper being killed. You were saying that that hasn't been filmed before. RW  Yes  this is actually the first time anyone of us knew about it  for one thing. As I said  it's just like a little snack for him  you know  Usually they eat larger snakes like rat snakes  or even cobras. But this guy who we're following right now is in the deep jungle. Whereas other king cobras very often come into the human interface  you know  the plantations  to find big rat snakes and stuff. This guy specializes in pit vipers. And the guy who is working there with them  he's from Maharashtra  he said   I think he's after the nusha.  Now  the nusha means the high. Whenever he eats the pit viper he gets this little venom rush. CA  Thanks Rom. Thank you. Hi. For those of you who haven't seen dancing bears  these are the dancing bears. In       we started working on a two year investigative research project to try and find out what was going on. Because the sloth bears in the wild were obviously getting depleted because of this. This is the Qalandar community. They are a marginalized Islamic community who live across India  and have been in India since the   th century. We went about getting evidence of what was going on. And this is footage from a hidden camera in a button. And we went in  pretending to be buyers. And we found this right in this very state  in Karnataka. And the bear cubs were being harvested from across the country and being sold and traded. These were being sold for about       dollars each  and they are used for bear paw soup  and also being trained  later on  to become dancing bears like the one you just saw. Sadly  the family of Qalandars depended on this bear. The couple are barely    years old. They already have four children beside them. You can see them. And the economy of the family and their livelihood depended on those animals. So  we had to deal with it in a very practical and sustainable manner. Now  when we started working deeper and digging deeper  we found that it's an illegal act. These guys could go to jail for up to seven years if they were caught by authorities. And what they were doing to the bears was really appalling. It was unacceptable. The mother bears are usually killed. The cubs  which are taken  are separated. Their teeth are basically bashed out with a metal rod. And they use a red hot iron needle to make a hole through the muzzle. Now we had to start changing these people and converting them from using that for a livelihood  to getting something else. So  this is Bitu Qalandar  who was our first experiment. And we were so unsure that this would work. We weren't sure at all. And we managed to convince him. And we said   Okay  here is some seed fund. Let's see if you can get something else.  And we got the bear surrendered to    we set up a sanctuary. We have four sanctuaries in India. And now he sells cool drinks  he's by the highway. He has a telephone booth. And then it started  there was no turning back after that. This is Sadua who came and surrendered his bear. And now he runs a cattle fodder store and a grain store near Agra. Then there was no looking back at all for us. We gave cycle rickshaws. We set up carpet weaving units  vocational training for the women. The women were just not allowed to come out of the community and work with mainstream society. So  we were able to address that. Education. The kids never went to school. They only had Islamic education  very little of it. And they were never allowed to go to school because they were an extra earning hand at home. So we managed to get education. So  we sponsor     children education programs today. We were able to ensure brighter futures for these people. Of course we also had to get the bears in. This is what happens to the bears when they come in. And this is what we turn them into. We have a veterinary facility in our rescue centers. So  basically in      there were       dancing bears. We rescued over     dancing bears. We've been able to ensure better futures for the people and the bears. The big news that I want to announce today is that next month we will be bringing in the very last bear of India  into our rescue center. And India will no longer have to witness this cruel barbaric practice which has been here for centuries. And the people can hold their heads up high. And the Qalandar people will rise above all this cruel barbaric past that they've lived all their lives. And the beautiful bears can of course live in the wild again. And there will be no more removing of these bears. And the children  both humans and bear cubs can live peacefully. Thank you. Contagious is a good word. Even in the times of H N   I like the word. Laughter is contagious. Passion is contagious. Inspiration is contagious. We've heard some remarkable stories from some remarkable speakers. But for me  what was contagious about all of them was that they were infected by something I call the  I Can  bug. So  the question is  why only them  In a country of a billion people and some  why so few  Is it luck  Is it chance  Can we all not systematically and consciously get infected  So  in the next eight minutes I would like to share with you my story. I got infected when I was     when  as a student of the design college  I encountered adults who actually believed in my ideas  challenged me and had lots of cups of chai with me. And I was struck by just how wonderful it felt  and how contagious that feeling was. I also realized I should have got infected when I was seven. So  when I started Riverside school    years ago it became a lab  a lab to prototype and refine a design process that could consciously infect the mind with the  I Can  bug. And I uncovered that if learning is embedded in real world context  that if you blur the boundaries between school and life  then children go through a journey of  aware   where they can see the change   enable   be changed  and then  empower   lead the change. And that directly increased student wellbeing. Children became more competent  and less helpless. But this was all common sense. So  I'd like to show you a little glimpse of what common practice looks like at Riverside. A little background  when my grade five was learning about child rights  they were made to roll incense sticks  agarbattis  for eight hours to experience what it means to be a child laborer. It transformed them. What you will see is their journey  and then their utter conviction that they could go out and change the world. That's them rolling. And in two hours  after their backs were broke  they were changed. And once that happened  they were out in the city convincing everybody that child labor just had to be abolished. And look at Ragav  that moment when his face changes because he's been able to understand that he has shifted that man's mindset. And that can't happen in a classroom. So  when Ragav experienced that he went from  teacher told me   to  I am doing it.  And that's the  I Can  mindshift. And it is a process that can be energized and nurtured. But we had parents who said   Okay  making our children good human beings is all very well  but what about math and science and English  Show us the grades.  And we did. The data was conclusive. When children are empowered  not only do they do good  they do well  in fact very well  as you can see in this national benchmarking assessment taken by over       schools in India  Riverside children were outperforming the top    schools in India in math  English and science. So  it worked. It was now time to take it outside Riverside. So  on August   th  Independence Day        the children of Riverside set out to infect Ahmedabad. Now it was not about Riverside school. It was about all children. So  we were shameless. We walked into the offices of the municipal corporation  the police  the press  businesses  and basically said   When are you going to wake up and recognize the potential that resides in every child  When will you include the child in the city  Basically  open your hearts and your minds to the child.  So  how did the city respond  Since      every other month the city closes down the busiest streets for traffic and converts it into a playground for children and childhood. Here was a city telling its child   You can.  A glimpse of infection in Ahmedabad. Video   Unclear  So  the busiest streets closed down. We have the traffic police and municipal corporation helping us. It gets taken over by children. They are skating. They are doing street plays. They are playing  all free  for all children. Atul Karwal  aProCh is an organization which has been doing things for kids earlier. And we plan to extend this to other parts of the city. Kiran Bir Sethi  And the city will give free time. And Ahmedabad got the first child friendly zebra crossing in the world. Geet Sethi  When a city gives to the children  in the future the children will give back to the city. KBS  And because of that  Ahmedabad is known as India's first child friendly city. So  you're getting the pattern. First     children at Riverside. Then        children in Ahmedabad  and growing. It was time now to infect India. So  on August   th  again  Independence Day        empowered with the same process  we empowered         children to say   I can.  How  We designed a simple toolkit  converted it into eight languages  and reached        schools. We basically gave children a very simple challenge. We said  take one idea  anything that bothers you  choose one week  and change a billion lives. And they did. Stories of change poured in from all over India  from Nagaland in the east  to Jhunjhunu in the west  from Sikkim in the north  to Krishnagiri in the south. Children were designing solutions for a diverse range of problems. Right from loneliness to filling potholes in the street to alcoholism  and    children who stopped    child marriages in Rajasthan. I mean  it was incredible. Basically again reaffirming that when adults believe in children and say   You can   then they will. Infection in India. This is in Rajasthan  a rural village. Child  Our parents are illiterate and we want to teach them how to read and write. KBS  First time  a rally and a street play in a rural school    unheard of    to tell their parents why literacy is important. Look at what their parents says. Man  This program is wonderful. We feel so nice that our children can teach us how to read and write. Woman  I am so happy that my students did this campaign. In the future  I will never doubt my students' abilities. See  They have done it. KBS  An inner city school in Hyderabad. Girl     . This house is     ... We have to start collecting from    . KBS  Girls and boys in Hyderabad  going out  pretty difficult  but they did it. Woman  Even though they are so young  they have done such good work. First they have cleaned the society  then it will be Hyderabad  and soon India. Woman  It was a revelation for me. It doesn't strike me that they had so much inside them. Girl  Thank you  ladies and gentlemen. For our auction we have some wonderful paintings for you  for a very good cause  the money you give us will be used to buy hearing aids. Are you ready  ladies and gentlemen  Audience  Yes  Girl  Are you ready  Audience  Yes  Girl  Are you ready  Audience  Yes  KBS  So  the charter of compassion starts right here. Street plays  auctions  petitions. I mean  they were changing lives. It was incredible. So  how can we still stay immune  How can we stay immune to that passion  that energy  that excitement  I know it's obvious  but I have to end with the most powerful symbol of change  Gandhiji.    years ago  it took one man to infect an entire nation with the power of  We can.  So  today who is it going to take to spread the infection from         children to the     million children in India  Last I heard  the preamble still said   We  the people of India   right  So  if not us  then who  If not now  then when  Like I said  contagious is a good word. Thank you. I am going to be talking about secrets. Obviously the best way to divulge a secret is to tell someone to not say anything about it. Secrets. I'm using PowerPoint this year just because  you know  I'm into the TED thing. And when you use these things you don't have to go like that. You just press it. Oh  man. Um  yes. Yes. I'm sure  Just change it  Is Bill Gates here  Change it  Come on  What  Ah  Okay. That's not my slides  but it's okay. As you can see  these are all maps. And maps are important devices for transferring information  especially if you have human cognitive ability. We can see that all formulas are really maps. Now  as humans  we make maps of places that we seldom even go  which seems a little wasteful of time. This  of course  is a map of the moon. There're some very delightful names. Tranquilacalitis   unclear . My favorite is Frigoris. What are these people thinking  Frigoris  What the Frigoris you doing  Names are important. Frigoris  This is the Moon. People could live there one day. I'll meet you at Frigoris. No. I don't think so. There we see Mars  again with various names. And this is all done  by the way  by the International Astronomical Union. This is an actual group of people that sit around naming planetary objects. This is from their actual book. These are some of the names that they have chosen  ladies and gentlemen. I'll go through a little of them. Bolotnitsa. That  of course  is the Slavic swamp mermaid. Now I think the whole concept of a mermaid doesn't really blend into the swamp feel.  Oh look  Mermaid come out of swamp. Oh boy  It's time for Bolotnitsa   Djabran Fluctus. If that don't flow off the tongue  what does  I mean kids are studying this stuff and they've got the word  fluctus  up there. That's wrong. One dyslexic kid and he could be ruining his life.  It fluctus up  Mama.  Hikuleo Fluctus. That's a little more flowing. Hikuleo sounds like a kind of a Leonardo DiCaprio    syllable thing. And that's the Tonga underworld. And one of my favorites is the Itoki Fluctus  who is the Nicaraguan goddess of insects  stars  and planets. Now  if you're a goddess of stars and planets wouldn't you relegate insects to somebody else   No  no  really  I'm so busy with the stars. Would you mind taking the insects  Thank you darling. Oh take the spiders too. I know they're not insects  but I don't care. Monkeys  chimps  just get rid of the hairy creatures.  Now  we're going to be going to Mars one day. And when we do  it's going to be unfair for the people that are living there to have to live with these ridiculous names. So  you'll be on Mars  and you're at Hellespointica Depressio which has got to be a really  up  place. Yeah  I'm at the Depressio  and I want to get over to Amazonis so I plug it into the Mars map  and click the button and there's my directions. I go to Chrysokeras. Then to Niliacus Lacus  which is not a bad name. Niliacus Lacus  try to get the practice  slick a tick a bacus. That's a cool name. I will say that. So  I hold back a little of my venom for these astronomical misnomers. And then of course Arnon to Thoth. And of course there will be advertisements. This is from their rule book  the International Astronomical Union. And you know they're international because they put it  en Francais  as well. L'Union Astronomique Internationale  for those of you who don't speak French. I thought I'd translate for you. From the rulebook  Nomenclature is a tool. The first consideration  make it clear  simple and unambiguous. And I think that Djabran Fluctus  that fits that mode. That's simple  the goddess of goats  very simple. Djabran Fluctus.  Now  Frank is this clear to you  Djabran Fluctus    Yeah  that's the goat goddess right  The Abacazanian  It's clear to me.   Listen  I'm going back to the swamp mermaid. Can you call me in a little while   Also  from the actual document I highlighted a part I thought may be of interest. Anyone can suggest changing a name. So  I look to you  fellow member of the Earth community. We've got to change this stuff up fast. So  these are actual names of people that work there. I did some more investigation. These are more people working for this group. And  as you can see  they don't use their first names. These are people naming planets  and they won't use their first names. Something is askew here. Is it because his name is really Jupiter Blunck  Is that Ganymede Andromeda Burba  Is that Mars Ya Marov  I don't know. But it's investigative material  no doubt. There are some mapping people who do use their names. Witness please  Eugene Shoemaker  who  diligently  from a young boy decided he wanted to make maps of celestial bodies. Must have been a very interesting day in the Shoemaker house.  Mom  I want to make maps.   That's wonderful Eugene. You could make maps of Toronto.   No  I want to make maps of planets.   Yeah  go to your room.  Martians  Venusians  Jovians. We have names for places where people don't exist. That seems a little silly to me. There are no Jovians. Getting back to my premise  I used stamps  by the way  because you don't have to pay anybody for the rights. There is obviously Einstein  Niels Bohr  de Fermat's last theorem  and I'm not sure whether that's James Coburn or Richard Harris. It's definitely one of the two. I'm not really clear which one. But obviously the point is that numbers are maps. And within numbers  is there an underlying secret to the universe  That is the premise of this particular presentation. By the way  that's a natural picture of Saturn  no adjustments. I mean that's just beautiful. So beautiful that I will even give up a laugh to explain my love of this particular planet  and the day Saturday  named after it  wonderfully. So  formulas relate number to form. That's Euler  his formula was one of the inspirations that lead to the beginning of string theory which is kind of cool  not that funny  but it is cool. He was also famous for having no body. Which a lot of you are like   How did he figure that out   He's got no body  no man  just a head floating high. Here comes Euler. And that's an icosahedron  which is one of the five sacred solids  very important shapes. You see the icosahedron again. The dodecahedron  it's dual. There is a dodecahedron which I had to do in my room last night. The five sacred solids  as you can see there. Which is not to be confused with the five sacred salads. Blue cheese  ranch  oil and vinegar  thousand islands and house. I suggest the house. The reality  now here is something important. What's important about this is these shapes are duals of each other. And you can see how the icosahedron withdraws into the dodecahedron and then they just merge into each other. So  the whole concept of branes in the universe  if the universe is shaped like a dodecahedron this is a very good map of what could possibly be. And that is  of course  what we are here to talk about. What a coincidence  October  th  in France  Jean Pierre Luminet said that the universe is probably shaped like a dodecahedron  based on information that they got from this probe. This would be a normal wave pattern. But what they're seeing  way out there in the far reaches of the microwave background  is this kind of odd undulation. It doesn't plug in to what they suspected a flat universe would be. So  you can kind of get an idea from this extrapolating that back under this huge picture  so we get this idea of what the primal universe looked like. And judging from this  it looks a little like a cheeseburger. So  I'm thinking the universe is either a dodecahedron or a cheeseburger. And for me  that's a win win. Everybody goes  I'm happy. Better really hurry up. I just threw this in because as important as all of our intellectual abilities are  without heart and without love it's just    it's all meaningless. And that  to me  is really beautiful. Except for that creepy guy in the background. Getting back to the point of my particular presentation  Kepler  one of my great heroes  who realized that these five solids  which I spoke of earlier  were related somehow to the planets  but he couldn't prove it. It freaked him out. But it did lead to Newton discovering gravity. So  maps of things leading to organized understandings of the universe in which we emerge. Now this is Isaac from a Vietnamese stamp. I am not suggesting at all that my Vietnamese brothers and sisters could maybe use a little art class here and there. But ... that's not a good picture. Not a good picture. Now  my friends in the island of Nevis are a little better. Look at that  That's Isaac Newton. That guy is rockin'. What a handsome cat. Once again  Nicaragua let me down. And Copernicus looks like Johnny Carson  which is really weird. I don't get that at all. Once again  these guys rock it out. Isaac is kickin' ass. Man  he looks like a rock star. This is freaky is a major way. This is Sierra Leone. They got little babies in there  floating in there. Man. I don't really need to comment on this. But I didn't know that Isaac Newton was in the Moody Blues. Did you  When did this happen  It's a different kind of course. And they've got five apples  I mean these guys are extrapolating in realms that are not necessarily valid. Although five is a good number  of course. Ecuador  my friend Kepler  as you can see  they call him Juan. Juan  No  Johannes  not Juan. It wasn't Carlos Chaplain. It's wrong. Ren  Descartes  of course. Once again these Grenada people  this is like way too sick for anybody's imagination. He's all murky. There is little kids leaning on his leg  little ghosts flying around. We gotta clean this stuff up fast  ladies and gentlemen. This is  of course  the Cartesian coordinates. Once again  that's Sierra Leone. This is again  indicating how numbers relate to space relate to form  maps of the universe. Because that's why we're here  really  I think to figure stuff out and to love each other. Descartes.  Laughter  Before the horse.  Laughter  Now  Monaco took Descartes  and just flipped him around. Now  Monaco is problematic for me  and I'll show you why. Here is a map. All they have is a casino on it. And why Franklin Delano Roosevelt is on their map I don't even want to hazard a guess. But I'd say he'd been to Hellespointica Depressio recently. This is the flag of Monaco. Ladies and gentlemen  the flag of Indonesia. Please examine. Not sure how this came to be  but it's not right. In Monaco   No  what are you talking about  They are so different. Look  ours is more red  it's longer. They stole our flag  They stole our flag   Bode's law wasn't even his law. It was a guy named Titus. And the reason I just bring this up because it is a law that doesn't really work. That's Jude Law and some of his films recently didn't work. Just a correlation that indicates how things are misinterpreted. And I wonder if the photographer said   Okay  Jude  could you touch your tooth  That's good.  Just a tip  if you're being photographed for press pictures  don't touch your teeth. Prime numbers  Gauss  one of my favorites. Golden section  I've been obsessed with this thing since before I was born. I know that scares a lot of you  but that was my purpose entirely. There we can see Fibonacci numbers related to the Golden Section  because Fibonacci and Golden Section relate to the unfolding of the measured meter of matter  as I refer to it. If Fibonacci had been on Paxil  that would be the Fibonacci series.  Ten milligram     milligram.   Leonardo  dinner's ready  put down those books and take your pills.   Yes  Mama.  Alright where is this going  That's a good question. Here is the premise that I began    years ago. If numbers can express the laws of this incredible universe that we live  I reason  through some sort of reverse engineering  we could extrapolate from them some basic structural element of this universe. And that's what I did. Twenty seven years ago I started working on this. And I tried to build a particle accelerator. And that didn't work out well. So  then I thought a calculator is a metaphor. I can just divide numbers  that's like atom smashing. That's what I did. That's how I found Moleeds. Moleeds are what I believe the thing that will allow string theory to be proved. They are the nodes on the string  patterns and relationships        . That was the first chart I came up with. You can see  even if you don't go for the numbers  the beauty of the symmetry. The numbers from one to     divided into six groups. Symmetry  pairs. Every top adds up to   . Bottom  all   . There is so many intricate relationships that I'm not going to go there now  because you would say   Hey  go back to the Fluctus part.  Circle of Fifths  acoustic harmony  geometric symmetry. I knew those two were related. Once again  the Cartesian kind of cross over. So  I said if I'm going to put a circle  see what kind of patterns I get  boom  the Red System. Look at that. You can't just make this stuff up  ladies and gentlemen. You can't just go around going   Oh  I'm going to put some triangles in a circle and they're going to be symmetrical. And they're all going to add up  and it's going to be  oh yeah  I figured that out.  This is beyond anything anybody could just make up. There is the Orange System. And you'll see over here  these are multiples of the number   . And they recapitulate that shape  even though that's a circle of nine and that's a circle of   . It's nuts. That's the Green System. It all folds in half on the Green System  right between    and   . The Blue System. The Violet. It's all there. Look at that  I mean you cannot make that stuff up. That just doesn't fall out of a tree  ladies and gentlemen. Twenty seven years of my life  And I'm presenting it here at TED. Why  Because this is the place if aliens land  I hope they come here.  We are going to destroy the Earth. Hmmm ... maybe not.  In this last year I have found these subsequent systems which allow for the mathematic possibilities of the Calabi Yau manifolds in a way that doesn't necessitate these little hidden dimensions. Which works mathematically  but it just doesn't seem God like to me. It just seems like it's not sexy and elegant  it's hidden. I don't want hidden  I want to see it. I found other pairs all have symmetry  even though  unlike the master one  their symmetry is split. Unbelievable. This is like crazy. Am I the only one that sees this  You know  I didn't just draw this in a day  by the way. You know  try making some charts like this at home. You gotta be accurate  There's measurement involved  increments. These are maps  by the way. Not stamps  but one day. Okay  I'm getting to the punch. Golden Ratio  it's crazy. And look at this  built within it is the Golden Ratio. I start looking at that  and look at them again. They start looking like planets. I go to JPL. I look at the orbits of the planets. I find    examples of it in our solar system. I never told anybody. This is the first thing. This could be history. Kepler was right. Eighteen and     the middle of the Moleeds   .    is the golden section. Multiply them together    .    x   .    is    .   . Which is .    different from the number of days in a year. Hey  you can't make this up. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. As a magician  I try to create images that make people stop and think. I also try to challenge myself to do things that doctors say are not possible. I was buried alive in New York City in a coffin  buried alive in a coffin in April        for a week. I lived there with nothing but water. And it ended up being so much fun that I decided I could pursue doing more of these things. The next one is I froze myself in a block of ice for three days and three nights in New York City. That one was way more difficult than I had expected. The one after that  I stood on top of a hundred foot pillar for    hours. I began to hallucinate so hard that the buildings that were behind me started to look like big animal heads. So  next I went to London. In London I lived in a glass box for    days with nothing but water. It was  for me  one of the most difficult things I'd ever done  but it was also the most beautiful. There was so many skeptics  especially the press in London  that they started flying cheeseburgers on helicopters around my box to tempt me. So  I felt very validated when the New England Journal of Medicine actually used the research for science. My next pursuit was I wanted to see how long I could go without breathing  like how long I could survive with nothing  not even air. I didn't realize that it would become the most amazing journey of my life. As a young magician  I was obsessed with Houdini and his underwater challenges. So  I began  early on  competing against the other kids  seeing how long I could stay underwater while they went up and down to breathe  you know  five times  while I stayed under on one breath. By the time I was a teenager  I was able to hold my breath for three minutes and    seconds. I would later find out that was Houdini's personal record. In      I heard of a story about a boy that fell through ice and was trapped under a river. He was underneath  not breathing for    minutes. When the rescue workers came  they resuscitated him and there was no brain damage. His core temperature had dropped to    degrees. As a magician  I think everything is possible. And I think if something is done by one person  it can be done by others. I started to think  if the boy could survive without breathing for that long  there must be a way that I could do it. So  I met with a top neurosurgeon. And I asked him  how long is it possible to go without breathing  like how long could I go without air  And he said to me that anything over six minutes you have a serious risk of hypoxic brain damage. So  I took that as a challenge  basically. My first try  I figured that I could do something similar  and I created a water tank  and I filled it with ice and freezing cold water. And I stayed inside of that water tank hoping my core temperature would start to drop. And I was shivering. In my first attempt to hold my breath  I couldn't even last a minute. So  I realized that was completely not going to work. I went to talk to a doctor friend    and I asked him   How could I do that    I want to hold my breath for a really long time. How could it be done   And he said   David  you're a magician  create the illusion of not breathing  it will be much easier.  So  he came up with this idea of creating a rebreather  with a CO  scrubber  which was basically a tube from Home Depot  with a balloon duct taped to it  that he thought we could put inside of me  and somehow be able to circulate the air and rebreathe with this thing in me. This is a little hard to watch. But this is that attempt. So  that clearly wasn't going to work. Then I actually started thinking about liquid breathing. There is a chemical that's called perflubron. And it's so high in oxygen levels that in theory you could breathe it. So  I got my hands on that chemical  filled the sink up with it  and stuck my face in the sink and tried to breathe that in  which was really impossible. It's basically like trying to breathe  as a doctor said  while having an elephant standing on your chest. So  that idea disappeared. Then I started thinking  would it be possible to hook up a heart lung bypass machine and have a surgery where it was a tube going into my artery  and then appear to not breathe while they were oxygenating my blood  Which was another insane idea  obviously. Then I thought about the craziest idea of all the ideas  to actually do it. To actually try to hold my breath past the point that doctors would consider you brain dead. So  I started researching into pearl divers. You know  because they go down for four minutes on one breath. And when I was researching pearl divers  I found the world of free diving. It was the most amazing thing that I ever discovered  pretty much. There is many different aspects to free diving. There is depth records  where people go as deep as they can. And then there is static apnea. That's holding your breath as long as you can in one place without moving. That was the one that I studied. The first thing that I learned is when you're holding your breath  you should never move at all  that wastes energy. And that depletes oxygen  and it builds up CO  in your blood. So  I learned never to move. And I learned how to slow my heart rate down. I had to remain perfectly still and just relax and think that I wasn't in my body  and just control that. And then I learned how to purge. Purging is basically hyperventilating. You blow in and out    You do that  you get lightheaded  you get tingling. And you're really ridding your body of CO . So  when you hold your breath  it's infinitely easier. Then I learned that you have to take a huge breath  and just hold and relax and never let any air out  and just hold and relax through all the pain. Every morning  this is for months  I would wake up and the first thing that I would do is I would hold my breath for  out of    minutes  I would hold my breath for    minutes. So  basically what that means is I would purge  I'd breathe really hard for a minute. And I would hold  immediately after  for five and a half minutes. Then I would breathe again for a minute  purging as hard as I can  then immediately after that I would hold again for five and a half minutes. I would repeat this process eight times in a row. Out of    minutes  you're only breathing for eight minutes. At the end of that you're completely fried  your brain. You feel like you're walking around in a daze. And you have these awful headaches. Basically  I'm not the best person to talk to when I'm doing that stuff. I started learning about the world record holder. His name is Tom Sietas. And this guy is perfectly built for holding his breath. He's six foot four. He's     pounds. And his total lung capacity is twice the size of an average person. I'm six foot one  and fat. We'll say big boned. I had to drop    pounds in three months. So  everything that I put into my body  I considered as medicine. Every bit of food was exactly what it was for its nutritional value. I ate really small controlled portions throughout the day. And I started to really adapt my body.  Individual results may vary  The thinner I was  the longer I was able to hold my breath. And by eating so well and training so hard  my resting heart rate dropped to    beats per minute. Which is lower than most Olympic athletes. In four months of training  I was able to hold my breath for over seven minutes. I wanted to try holding my breath everywhere. I wanted to try it in the most extreme situations to see if I could slow my heart rate down under duress. I decided that I was going to break the world record live on prime time television. The world record was eight minutes and    seconds  held by Tom Sietas  that guy with the whale lungs I told you about. I assumed that I could put a water tank at Lincoln Center and if I stayed there a week not eating  I would get comfortable in that situation and I would slow my metabolism  which I was sure would help me hold my breath longer than I had been able to do it. I was completely wrong. I entered the sphere a week before the scheduled air date. And I thought everything seemed to be on track. Two days before my big breath hold attempt  for the record  the producers of my television special thought that just watching somebody holding their breath  and almost drowning  is too boring for television. So  I had to add handcuffs  while holding my breath  to escape from. This was a critical mistake. Because of the movement  I was wasting oxygen. And by seven minutes I had gone into these awful convulsions. By       I started to black out. And by seven minutes and    seconds  they had to pull my body out and bring me back. I had failed on every level. So  naturally  the only way out of the slump that I could think of was  I decided to call Oprah. I told her that I wanted to up the ante and hold my breath longer than any human being ever had. This was a different record. This was a pure O  static apnea record that Guinness had set the world record at    minutes. So  basically you breathe pure O  first  oxygenating your body  flushing out CO   and you are able to hold much longer. I realized that my real competition was the beaver. In January of '    Oprah gave me four months to prepare and train. So  I would sleep in a hypoxic tent every night. A hypoxic tent is a tent that simulates altitude at        feet. So  it's like base camp  Everest. What that does is  you start building up the red bloodcell count in your body  which helps you carry oxygen better. Every morning  again  after getting out of that tent  your brain is completely wiped out. My first attempt on pure O   I was able to go up to    minutes. So  it was a pretty big success. The neurosurgeon pulled me out of the water because in his mind  at    minutes your brain is done  you're brain dead. So  he pulled me up  and I was fine. There was one person there that was definitely not impressed. It was my ex girlfriend. While I was breaking the record underwater for the first time  she was sifting through my Blackberry  checking all my messages. My brother had a picture of it. It is really    I then announced that I was going to go for Sietas' record  publicly. And what he did in response  is he went on Regis and Kelly  and broke his old record. Then his main competitor went out and broke his record. So  he suddenly pushed the record up to    minutes and    seconds. Which was three minutes longer than I had prepared. It was longer than the record. I wanted to get the Science Times to document this. I wanted to get them to do a piece on it. So  I did what any person seriously pursuing scientific advancement would do. I walked into the New York Times offices and did card tricks to everybody. So  I don't know if it was the magic or the lure of the Cayman Islands  but John Tierney flew down and did a piece on the seriousness of breath holding. While he was there  I tried to impress him  of course. And I did a dive down to     feet  which is basically the height of a    story building  and as I was coming up  I blacked out underwater  which is really dangerous  that's how you drown. Luckily  Kirk had seen me and he swam over and pulled me up. So  I started full focus. I completely trained to get my breath hold time up for what I needed to do. But there was no way to prepare for the live television aspect of it  being on Oprah. But in practice  I would do it face down  floating on the pool. But for TV they wanted me to be upright so they could see my face  basically. The other problem was the suit was so buoyant that they had to strap my feet in to keep me from floating up. So  I had to use my legs to hold my feet into the straps that were loose  which was a real problem for me. That made me extremely nervous  raising the heart rate. Then  what they also did was  which we never did before  is there was a heart rate monitor. And it was right next to the sphere. So  every time my heart would beat  I'd hear the beep beep beep beep  you know  the ticking  really loud. Which was making me more nervous. And there was no way to slow my heart rate down. Normally  I would start at    beats per minute  and while holding my breath  it would drop to    beats per minute  which is pretty unusual. This time it started at     beats  and it never went down. I spent the first five minutes underwater desperately trying to slow my heart rate down. I was just sitting there thinking   I've got to slow this down. I'm going to fail.  And I was getting more nervous. And the heart rate just kept going up and up  all the way up to     beats. Basically it's the same thing that created my downfall at Lincoln Center. It was a waste of O . When I made it to the halfway mark  at eight minutes  I was     percent certain that I was not going to be able to make this. There was no way for me to do it. I figured  Oprah had dedicated an hour to doing this breath hold thing  if I had cracked early  it would be a whole show about how depressed I am. So  I figured I'm better off just fighting and staying there until I black out  at least then they can pull me out and take care of me and all that. I kept pushing to    minutes. At    minutes you start getting all these really strong tingling sensations in your fingers and toes. And I knew that that was blood shunting  when the blood rushes away from your extremities to provide oxygen to your vital organs. At    minutes I started feeling throbbing sensations in my legs  and my lips started to feel really strange. At minute    I started to have ringing in my ears  and I started to feel my arm going numb. And I'm a hypochondriac  and I remember arm numb means heart attack. So  I started to really get really paranoid. Then at    minutes  maybe because of the hypochondria  I started feeling pains all over my chest. It was awful. At    minutes  I had these awful contractions  like this urge to breathe. At    minutes I was suffering major O  deprivation to the heart. And I started having ischemia to the heart. My heartbeat would go from     to     to      to     to     to     again. It would skip a beat. It would start. It would stop. And I felt all this. And I was sure that I was going to have a heart attack. So  at    minutes what I did is I slid my feet out because I knew that if I did go out  if I did have a heart attack  they'd have to jump into the binding and take my feet out before pulling me up. I was really nervous. I let my feet out  and I started floating to the top. And I didn't take my head out. But I was just floating there waiting for my heart to stop  just waiting. They had doctors with the  Pst   you know  sitting there waiting. And then suddenly I hear screaming. And I think that there is some weird thing    that I had died or something had happened. And then I realized that I had made it to      . So  with the energy of everybody that was there  I decided to keep pushing. And I went to    minutes and four seconds. As though that wasn't enough  what I did immediately after is I went to Quest Labs and had them take every blood sample that they could to test for everything and to see where my levels were  so the doctors could use it  once again. I also didn't want anybody to question it. I had the world record and I wanted to make sure it was legitimate. So  I get to New York City the next day  I'm walking out of the Apple store  and this kid walks up to me he's like   Yo  D   I'm like  Yeah   He said   If you really held your breath that long  why'd you come out of the water dry   I was like  What   And that's my life. So    As a magician  I try to show things to people that seem impossible. And I think magic  whether I'm holding my breath or shuffling a deck of cards  is pretty simple. It's practice  it's training  and it's     Sobs  It's practice  it's training and experimenting  while pushing through the pain to be the best that I can be. And that's what magic is to me  so  thank you. Right now is the most exciting time to see new Indian art. Contemporary artists in India are having a conversation with the world like never before. I thought it might be interesting  even for the many long time collectors here with us at TED  local collectors  to have an outside view of    young Indian artists I wish everyone at TED to know. The first is Bharti Kher. The central motif of Bharti's practice is the ready made store bought bindi that untold millions of Indian women apply to their foreheads  every day  in an act closely associated with the institution of marriage. But originally the significance of the bindi is to symbolize the third eye between the spiritual world and the religious world. Bharti seeks to liberate this everyday cliche  as she calls it  by exploding it into something spectacular. She also creates life size fiberglass sculptures  often of animals  which she then completely covers in bindis  often with potent symbolism. She says she first got started with    packets of bindis  and then wondered what she could do with    thousand. Our next artist  Balasubramaniam  really stands at the crossroads of sculpture  painting and installation  working wonders with fiberglass. Since Bala himself will be speaking at TED I won't spend too much time on him here today  except to say that he really succeeds at making the invisible visible. Brooklyn based Chitra Ganesh is known for her digital collages  using Indian comic books called amar chitra kathas as her primary source material. These comics are a fundamental way that children  especially in the diaspora  learn their religious and mythological folk tales. I  for one  was steeped in these. Chitra basically remixes and re titles these iconic images to tease out some of the sexual and gender politics embedded in these deeply influential comics. And she uses this vocabulary in her installation work as well. Jitish Kallat successfully practices across photography  sculpture  painting and installation. As you can see  he's heavily influenced by graffiti and street art  and his home city of Mumbai is an ever present element in his work. He really captures that sense of density and energy which really characterizes modern urban Bombay. He also creates phantasmagoric sculptures made of bones from cast resin. Here he envisions the carcass of an autorickshaw he once witnessed burning in a riot. This next artist  N.S. Harsha  actually has a studio right here in Mysore. He's putting a contemporary spin on the miniature tradition. He creates these fine  delicate images which he then repeats on a massive scale. He uses scale to more and more spectacular effect  whether on the roof of a temple in Singapore  or in his increasingly ambitious installation work  here with     functioning sewing machines  fabricating the flags of every member of the United Nations. Mumbai based Dhruvi Acharya builds on her love of comic books and street art to comment on the roles and expectations of modern Indian women. She too mines the rich source material of amar chitra kathas  but in a very different way than Chitra Ganesh. In this particular work  she actually strips out the images and leaves the actual text to reveal something previously unseen  and provocative. Raqib Shaw is Kolkata born  Kashmir raised  and London trained. He too is reinventing the miniature tradition. He creates these opulent tableaus inspired by Hieronymus Bosch  but also by the Kashmiri textiles of his youth. He actually applies metallic industrial paints to his work using porcupine quills to get this rich detailed effect. I'm kind of cheating with this next artist since Raqs Media Collective are really three artists working together. Raqs are probably the foremost practitioners of multimedia art in India today  working across photography  video and installation. They frequently explore themes of globalization and urbanization  and their home of Delhi is a frequent element in their work. Here  they invite the viewer to analyze a crime looking at evidence and clues embedded in five narratives on these five different screens  in which the city itself may have been the culprit. This next artist is probably the alpha male of contemporary Indian art  Subodh Gupta. He was first known for creating giant photo realistic canvases  paintings of everyday objects  the stainless steel kitchen vessels and tiffin containers known to every Indian. He celebrates these local and mundane objects globally  and on a grander and grander scale  by incorporating them into ever more colossal sculptures and installations. And finally number     last and certainly not least  Ranjani Shettar  who lives and works here in the state of Karnataka  creates ethereal sculptures and installations that really marry the organic to the industrial  and brings  like Subodh  the local global. These are actually wires wrapped in muslin and steeped in vegetable dye. And she arranges them so that the viewer actually has to navigate through the space  and interact with the objects. And light and shadow are a very important part of her work. She also explores themes of consumerism  and the environment  such as in this work  where these basket like objects look organic and woven  and are woven  but with the strips of steel  salvaged from cars that she found in a Bangalore junkyard.    artists  six minutes  I know that was a lot to take in. But I can only hope I've whet your appetite to go out and see and learn more about the amazing things that are happening in art in India today. Thank you very much for looking and listening. This is actually a painting that hangs at the Countway Library at Harvard Medical School. And it shows the first time an organ was ever transplanted. In the front  you see  actually  Joe Murray getting the patient ready for the transplant  while in the back room you see Hartwell Harrison  the Chief of Urology at Harvard  actually harvesting the kidney. The kidney was indeed the first organ ever to be transplanted to the human. That was back in          years ago. Yet we're still dealing with a lot of the same challenges as many decades ago. Certainly many advances  many lives saved. But we have a major shortage of organs. In the last decade the number of patients waiting for a transplant has doubled. While  at the same time  the actual number of transplants has remained almost entirely flat. That really has to do with our aging population. We're just getting older. Medicine is doing a better job of keeping us alive. But as we age  our organs tend to fail more. So  that's a challenge  not just for organs but also for tissues. Trying to replace pancreas  trying to replace nerves that can help us with Parkinson's. These are major issues. This is actually a very stunning statistic. Every    seconds a patient dies from diseases that could be treated with tissue regeneration or replacement. So  what can we do about it  We've talked about stem cells tonight. That's a way to do it. But still ways to go to get stem cells into patients  in terms of actual therapies for organs. Wouldn't it be great if our bodies could regenerate  Wouldn't it be great if we could actually harness the power of our bodies  to actually heal ourselves  It's not really that foreign of a concept  actually  it happens on the Earth every day. This is actually a picture of a salamander. Salamanders have this amazing capacity to regenerate. You see here a little video. This is actually a limb injury in this salamander. And this is actually real photography  timed photography  showing how that limb regenerates in a period of days. You see the scar form. And that scar actually grows out a new limb. So  salamanders can do it. Why can't we  Why can't humans regenerate  Actually  we can regenerate. Your body has many organs and every single organ in your body has a cell population that's ready to take over at the time of injury. It happens every day. As you age  as you get older. Your bones regenerate every    years. Your skin regenerates every two weeks. So  your body is constantly regenerating. The challenge occurs when there is an injury. At the time of injury or disease  the body's first reaction is to seal itself off from the rest of the body. It basically wants to fight off infection  and seal itself  whether it's organs inside your body  or your skin  the first reaction is for scar tissue to move in  to seal itself off from the outside. So  how can we harness that power  One of the ways that we do that is actually by using smart biomaterials. How does this work  Well  on the left side here you see a urethra which was injured. This is the channel that connects the bladder to the outside of the body. And you see that it is injured. We basically found out that you can use these smart biomaterials that you can actually use as a bridge. If you build that bridge  and you close off from the outside environment  then you can create that bridge  and cells that regenerate in your body  can then cross that bridge  and take that path. That's exactly what you see here. It's actually a smart biomaterial that we used  to actually treat this patient. This was an injured urethra on the left side. We used that biomaterial in the middle. And then  six months later on the right hand side you see this reengineered urethra. Turns out your body can regenerate  but only for small distances. The maximum efficient distance for regeneration is only about one centimeter. So  we can use these smart biomaterials but only for about one centimeter to bridge those gaps. So  we do regenerate  but for limited distances. What do we do now  if you have injury for larger organs  What do we do when we have injuries for structures which are much larger than one centimeter  Then we can start to use cells. The strategy here  is if a patient comes in to us with a diseased or injured organ  you can take a very small piece of tissue from that organ  less than half the size of a postage stamp  you can then tease that tissue apart  and look at its basic components  the patient's own cells  you take those cells out  grow and expand those cells outside the body in large quantities  and then we then use scaffold materials. To the naked eye they look like a piece of your blouse  or your shirt  but actually these materials are fairly complex and they are designed to degrade once inside the body. It disintegrates a few months later. It's acting only as a cell delivery vehicle. It's bringing the cells into the body. It's allowing the cells to regenerate new tissue  and once the tissue is regenerated the scaffold goes away. And that's what we did for this piece of muscle. This is actually showing a piece of muscle and how we go through the structures to actually engineer the muscle. We take the cells  we expand them  we place the cells on the scaffold  and we then place the scaffold back into the patient. But actually  before placing the scaffold into the patient  we actually exercise it. We want to make sure that we condition this muscle  so that it knows what to do once we put it into the patient. That's what you're seeing here. You're seeing this muscle bio reactor actually exercising the muscle back and forth. Okay. These are flat structures that we see here  the muscle. What about other structures  This is actually an engineered blood vessel. Very similar to what we just did  but a little bit more complex. Here we take a scaffold  and we basically    scaffold can be like a piece of paper here. And we can then tubularize this scaffold. And what we do is we  to make a blood vessel  same strategy. A blood vessel is made up of two different cell types. We take muscle cells  we paste  or coat the outside with these muscle cells  very much like baking a layer cake  if you will. You place the muscle cells on the outside. You place the vascular blood vessel lining cells on the inside. You now have your fully seeded scaffold. You're going to place this in an oven like device. It has the same conditions as a human body     degrees centigrade     percent oxygen. You then exercise it  as what you saw on that tape. And on the right you actually see a carotid artery that was engineered. This is actually the artery that goes from your neck to your brain. And this is an X ray showing you the patent  functional blood vessel. More complex structures such as blood vessels  urethras  which I showed you  they're definitely more complex because you're introducing two different cell types. But they are really acting mostly as conduits. You're allowing fluid or air to go through at steady states. They are not nearly as complex as hollow organs. Hollow organs have a much higher degree of complexity  because you're asking these organs to act on demand. So  the bladder is one such organ. Same strategy  we take a very small piece of the bladder  less than half the size of a postage stamp. We then tease the tissue apart into its two individual cell components  muscle  and these bladder specialized cells. We grow the cells outside the body in large quantities. It takes about four weeks to grow these cells from the organ. We then take a scaffold that we shape like a bladder. We coat the inside with these bladder lining cells. We coat the outside with these muscle cells. We place it back into this oven like device. From the time you take that piece of tissue  six to eight weeks later you can put the organ right back into the patient. This actually shows the scaffold. The material is actually being coated with the cells. When we did the first clinical trial for these patients we actually created the scaffold specifically for each patient. We brought patients in  six to eight weeks prior to their scheduled surgery  did X rays  and we then composed a scaffold specifically for that patient's size pelvic cavity. For the second phase of the trials we just had different sizes  small  medium  large and extra large. It's true. And I'm sure everyone here wanted an extra large. Right  So  bladders are definitely a little bit more complex than the other structures. But there are other hollow organs that have added complexity to it. This is actually a heart valve  which we engineered. And the way you engineer this heart valve is the same strategy. We take the scaffold  we seed it with cells  and you can now see here  the valve leaflets opening and closing. We exercise these prior to implantation. Same strategy. And then the most complex are the solid organs. For solid organs  they're more complex because you're using a lot more cells per centimeter. This is actually a simple solid organ like the ear. It's now being seeded with cartilage. That's the oven like device  once it's coated it gets placed there. And then a few weeks later we can take out the cartilage scaffold. This is actually digits that we're engineering. These are being layered  one layer at a time  first the bone  we fill in the gaps with cartilage. We then start adding the muscle on top. And you start layering these solid structures. Again  fairly more complex organs  but by far  the most complex solid organs are actually the vascularized  highly vascularized  a lot of blood vessel supply  organs such as the heart  the liver  the kidneys. This is actually an example    several strategies to engineer solid organs. This is actually one of the strategies. We use a printer. And instead of using ink  we use    you just saw an inkjet cartridge    we just use cells. This is actually your typical desktop printer. It's actually printing this two chamber heart  one layer at a time. You see the heart coming out there. It takes about    minutes to print  and about four to six hours later you see the muscle cells contract. This technology was developed by Tao Ju  who worked at our institute. And this is actually still  of course  experimental  not for use in patients. Another strategy that we have followed is actually to use decellularized organs. We actually take donor organs  organs that are discarded  and we then can use very mild detergents to take all the cell elements out of these organs. So  for example on the left panel  top panel  you see a liver. We actually take the donor liver  we use very mild detergents  and we  by using these mild detergents  we take all the cells out of the liver. Two weeks later  we basically can lift this organ up  it feels like a liver  we can hold it like a liver  it looks like a liver  but it has no cells. All we are left with is the skeleton  if you will  of the liver  all made up of collagen  a material that's in our bodies  that will not reject. We can use it from one patient to the next. We then take this vascular structure and we can prove that we retain the blood vessel supply. You can see  actually that's a fluoroscopy. We're actually injecting contrast into the organ. Now you can see it start. We're injecting the contrast into the organ into this decellularized liver. And you can see the vascular tree that remains intact. We then take the cells  the vascular cells  blood vessel cells  we perfuse the vascular tree with the patient's own cells. We perfuse the outside of the liver with the patient's own liver cells. And we can then create functional livers. And that's actually what you're seeing. This is still experimental. But we are able to actually reproduce the functionality of the liver structure  experimentally. For the kidney  as I talked to you about the first painting that you saw  the first slide I showed you     percent of the patients on the transplant wait list are waiting for a kidney     percent. So  another strategy we're following is actually to create wafers that we stack together  like an accordion  if you will. So  we stack these wafers together  using the kidney cells. And then you can see these miniature kidneys that we've engineered. They are actually making urine. Again  small structures  our challenge is how to make them larger  and that is something we're working on right now at the institute. One of the things that I wanted to summarize for you then is what is a strategy that we're going for in regenerative medicine. If at all possible  we really would like to use smart biomaterials that we can just take off the shelf and regenerate your organs. We are limited with distances right now  but our goal is actually to increase those distances over time. If we cannot use smart biomaterials  then we'd rather use your very own cells. Why  Because they will not reject. We can take cells from you  create the structure  put it right back into you  they will not reject. And if possible  we'd rather use the cells from your very specific organ. If you present with a diseased wind pipe we'd like to take cells from your windpipe. If you present with a diseased pancreas we'd like to take cells from that organ. Why  Because we'd rather take those cells which already know that those are the cell types you want. A windpipe cell already knows it's a windpipe cell. We don't need to teach it to become another cell type. So  we prefer organ specific cells. And today we can obtain cells from most every organ in your body  except for several which we still need stem cells for  like heart  liver  nerve and pancreas. And for those we still need stem cells. If we cannot use stem cells from your body then we'd like to use donor stem cells. And we prefer cells that will not reject and will not form tumors. And we're working a lot with the stem cells that we published on two years ago  stem cells from the amniotic fluid  and the placenta  which have those properties. So  at this point  I do want to tell you that some of the major challenges we have. You know  I just showed you this presentation  everything looks so good  everything works. Actually no  these technologies really are not that easy. Some of the work you saw today was performed by over     researchers at our institute across a    year time span. So  these are very tough technologies. Once you get the formula right you can replicate it. But it takes a lot to get there. So  I always like to show this cartoon. This is how to stop a runaway stage. And there you see the stagecoach driver  and he goes  on the top panel  He goes A  B  C  D  E  F. He finally stops the runaway stage. And those are usually the basic scientists  The bottom is usually the surgeons. I'm a surgeon so that's not that funny. But actually method A is the correct approach. And what I mean by that is that anytime we've launched one of these technologies to the clinic  we've made absolutely sure that we do everything we can in the laboratory before we ever launch these technologies to patients. And when we launch these technologies to patients we want to make sure that we ask ourselves a very tough question. Are you ready to place this in your own loved one  your own child  your own family member  and then we proceed. Because our main goal  of course  is first  to do no harm. I'm going to show you now  a very short clip  It's a five second clip of a patient who received one of the engineered organs. We started implanting some of these structures over    years ago. So  we have patients now walking around with organs  engineered organs  for over    years  as well. I'm going to show a clip of one young lady. She had a spina bifida defect  a spinal cord abnormality. She did not have a normal bladder. This is a segment from CNN. We are just taking five seconds. This is a segment that Sanjay Gupta actually took care of. Video  Kaitlyn M  I'm happy. I was always afraid that I was going to have like  an accident or something. And now I can just go and go out with my friends  go do whatever I want. Anthony Atala  See  at the end of the day  the promise of regenerative medicine is a single promise. And that is really very simple  to make our patients better. Thank you for your attention. Can geographic information make you healthy  In      I got hit by a train. My train was a heart attack. I found myself in a hospital in an intensive care ward  recuperating from emergency surgery. And I suddenly realized something  that I was completely in the dark. I started asking my questions   Well  why me    Why now    Why here    Could my doctor have warned me   So  what I want to do here in the few minutes I have with you is really talk about what is the formula for life and good health. Genetics  lifestyle and environment. That's going to sort of contain our risks  and if we manage those risks we're going to live a good life and a good healthy life. Well  I understand the genetics and lifestyle part. And you know why I understand that  Because my physicians constantly ask me questions about this. Have you ever had to fill out those long  legal size forms in your doctor's office  I mean  if you're lucky enough you get to do it more than once  right  Do it over and over again. And they ask you questions about your lifestyle and your family history  your medication history  your surgical history  your allergy history ... did I forget any history  But this part of the equation I didn't really get  and I don't think my physicians really get this part of the equation. What does that mean  my environment  Well  it can mean a lot of things. This is my life. These are my life places. We all have these. While I'm talking I'd like you to also be thinking about  How many places have you lived  Just think about that  you know  wander through your life thinking about this. And you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places. You spend it at rest and you spend it at work. And if you're like me  you're in an airplane a good portion of your time traveling some place. So  it's not really simple when somebody asks you   Where do you live  where do you work  and where do you spend all your time  And where do you expose yourselves to risks that maybe perhaps you don't even see   Well  when I have done this on myself  I always come to the conclusion that I spend about    percent of my time relatively in a small number of places. And I don't wander far from that place for a majority of my time  even though I'm an extensive global trekker. Now  I'm going to take you on a little journey here. I started off in Scranton  Pennsylvania. I don't know if anybody might hail from northeastern Pennsylvania  but this is where I spent my first    years with my little young lungs. You know  breathing high concentrations here of sulfur dioxide  carbon dioxide and methane gas  in unequal quantities       years of this. And if you've been in that part of the country  this is what those piles of burning  smoldering coal waste look like. So then I decided to leave that part of the world  and I was going to go to the mid west. OK  so I ended up in Louisville  Kentucky. Well  I decided to be neighbors to a place called Rubbertown. They manufacture plastics. They use large quantities chloroprene and benzene. Okay  I spent    years  in my middle age lungs now  breathing various concentrations of that. And on a clear day it always looked like this  so you never saw it. It was insidious and it was really happening. Then I decided I had to get really smart  I would take this job in the West Coast. And I moved to Redlands California. Very nice  and there my older  senior lungs  as I like to call them  I filled with particulate matter  carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone. Okay  Almost like the highest in the nation. Alright  this is what it looks like on a good day. If you've been there  you know what I'm talking about. So  what's wrong with this picture  Well  the picture is  there is a huge gap here. The one thing that never happens in my doctor's office  They never ask me about my place history. No doctor  can I remember  ever asking me   Where have you lived   They haven't asked me what kind of the quality of the drinking water that I put in my mouth or the food that I ingest into my stomach. They really don't do that. It's missing. Look at the kind of data that's available. This data's from all over the world    countries spend billions of dollars investing in this kind of research. Now  I've circled the places where I've been. Well  by design  if I wanted to have a heart attack I'd been in the right places. Right  So  how many people are in the white  How many people in the room have spent the majority of their life in the white space  Anybody  Boy you're lucky. How many have spent it in the red places  Oh  not so lucky. There are thousands of these kinds of maps that are displayed in atlases all over the world. They give us some sense of what's going to be our train wreck. But none of that's in my medical record. And it's not in yours either. So  here's my friend Paul. He's a colleague. He allowed his cell phone to be tracked every two hours            days out of the year for the last two years  everywhere he went. And you can see he's been to a few places around the United States. And this is where he has spent most of his time. If you really studied that you might have some clues as to what Paul likes to do. Anybody got any clues  Ski. Right. We can zoom in here  and we suddenly see that now we see where Paul has really spent a majority of his time. And all of those black dots are all of the toxic release inventories that are monitored by the EPA. Did you know that data existed  For every community in the United States  you could have your own personalized map of that. So  our cell phones can now build a place history. This is how Paul did it. He did it with his iPhone. This might be what we end up with. This is what the physician would have in front of him and her when we enter that exam room instead of just the pink slip that said I paid at the counter. Right  This could be my little assessment. And he looks at that and he says   Whoa Bill  I suggest that maybe you not decide  just because you're out here in beautiful California  and it's warm every day  that you get out and run at six o'clock at night. I'd suggest that that's a bad idea Bill  because of this report.  What I'd like to leave you for are two prescriptions. Okay  number one is  we must teach physicians about the value of geographical information. It's called geomedicine. There are about a half a dozen programs in the world right now that are focused on this. And they're in the early stages of development. These programs need to be supported  and we need to teach our future doctors of the world the importance of some of the information I've shared here with you today. The second thing we need to do is while we're spending billions and billions of dollars all over the world building an electronic health record  we make sure we put a place history inside that medical record. It not only will be important for the physician  it will be important for the researchers that now will have huge samples to draw upon. But it will also be useful for us. I could have made the decision  if I had this information  not to move to the ozone capital of the United States  couldn't I  I could make that decision. Or I could negotiate with my employer to make that decision in the best interest of myself and my company. With that  I would like to just say that Jack Lord said this almost    years ago. Just look at that for a minute. That was what the conclusion of the Dartmouth Atlas of Healthcare was about  was saying that we can explain the geographic variations that occur in disease  in illness  in wellness  and how our healthcare system actually operates. That was what he was talking about on that quote. And I would say he got it right almost a decade ago. So  I'd very much like to see us begin to really seize this as an opportunity to get this into our medical records. So with that  I'll leave you that in my particular view of view of health  Geography always matters. And I believe that geographic information can make both you and me very healthy. Thank you. I'm going to speak to you today about architectural agency. What I mean by that is that it's time for architecture to do things again  not just represent things. This is a construction helmet that I received two years ago at the groundbreaking of the largest project I  and my firm  have ever been involved in. I was thrilled to get it. I was thrilled to be the only person standing on the stage with a shiny silver helmet. I thought it represented the importance of the architect. I stayed thrilled until I got home  threw the helmet onto my bed  fell down onto my bed and realized inside there was an inscription. Now  I think that this is a great metaphor for the state of architecture and architects today. We are for decorative purposes only. Now  who do we have to blame  We can only blame ourselves. Over the last    years the design and construction industry has gotten much more complex and has gotten much more litigious. And we architects are cowards. So  as we have faced liability  we have stepped back and back  and unfortunately  where there is liability  guess what there is  power. So  eventually we have found ourselves in a totally marginalized position  way over here. Now  what did we do  We're cowards  but we're smart cowards. And so we redefined this marginalized position as the place of architecture. And we announced   Hey  architecture  it's over here  in this autonomous language we're going to seed control of processes.  And we were going to do something that was horrible for the profession. We actually created an artificial schism between creation and execution  as if you could actually create without knowing how to execute and as if you could actually execute without knowing how to create. Now  something else happened. And that's when we began to sell the world that architecture was created by individuals creating genius sketches. And that the incredible amount of effort to deliver those sketches for years and years and years is not only something to be derided  but we would merely write it off as merely execution. Now I'd argue that that is as absurd as stating that    minutes of copulation is the creative act  and nine months of gestation  and  God forbid     hours of child labor is merely execution. So  what do we architects need to do  We need to stitch back creation and execution. And we need to start authoring processes again instead of authoring objects. Now  if we do this  I believe we can go back    years and start reinjecting agency  social engineering  back into architecture. Now  there are all kinds of things that we architects need to learn how to do  like managing contracts  learning how to write contracts  understanding procurement processes  understanding the time value of money and cost estimation. But I'm going to reduce this to the beginning of the process  into three very pedantic statements. The first is  Take core positions with your client. I know it's shocking  right  that architecture would actually say that. The second position is  Actually take positions. Take joint positions with your client. This is the moment in which you as the architect and your client can begin to inject vision and agency. But it has to be done together. And then only after this is done are you allowed to do this  begin to put forward architectural manifestations that manifest those positions. And both owner and architect alike are empowered to critique those manifestations based on the positions that you've taken. Now  I believe that one really amazing thing will happen if you do this. I'd like to call it the lost art of productively losing control. You do not know what the end result is. But I promise you  with enough brain power and enough passion and enough commitment  you will arrive at conclusions that will transcend convention  and will simply be something that you could not have initially or individually conceived of. Alright  now I'm going to reduce all of this to a series of simple dumb sketches. This is the modus operandi that we have today. We roll     foot Spartan  i.e. our vision  up to our clients' gates of Troy. And we don't understand why they won't let us in. Right  Well  how about instead of doing that  we roll up to the gates something they want. Now this is a little bit of a dangerous metaphor  because of course we all know that inside of the Trojan Horse were a bunch of people with spears. So  we can change the metaphor. Let's call the Trojan Horse the vessel by which you get through the gate  get through the constraints of a project. At which point  you and your client have the ability to start considering what you're going to put inside that vessel  the agency  the vision. And if you do that  you do that responsibly  I believe that instead of delivering Spartans  you can deliver maidens. And if I could summarize that all up into one single sketch it would be this. If we are so good at our craft shouldn't we be able to conceive of an architectural manifestation that slides seamlessly through the project's and the client's constraints  Now  with that in mind  I'm going to show a project that's very dear to many people in this room   well  maybe not dear  but certainly close to many people in this room. And that's a project that is just about to open next week  the new home for the Dallas Theater Center  the Dee and Charles Wyly Theatre. Now  I'm going to present it on the same terms  issue  position and architectural manifestation. Now  the first issue that we faced was that the Dallas Theater Center had a notoriety that was beyond what you would expect of some place outside of the triumvirate of New York  Chicago and Seattle. And this had to do with the ambitions of the leadership. But it also had to do with something rather unusual  and that was this horrible little building that they'd been performing in. Why was this horrible little building so important to their renown and their innovation  Because they could do whatever they wanted to to this building. When you're on Broadway  you cannot tear the proscenium down. This building  when an artistic director wanted to do a  Cherry Orchard  and wanted people and wanted people to come out of a well on the stage  they brought a backhoe in  and they simply dug the hole. Well  that's exciting. And you can start to get the best artistic directors  scenic designers and actors from around the country to come to perform here because you can do things you can't do elsewhere. So  the first position we took was   Hey  we as architects had better not show up and do a pristine building that doesn't engender the same freedoms that this old dilapidated shed provided the company.  The second issue is a nuance of the first. And that's that the company and the building was multiform. That meant that they were able to perform  as long as they had labor they were able to go between proscenium  thrust  flat floor  arena  traverse  you name it. All they needed was labor. Well  something happened. In fact something happened to all institutions around the world. It started to become hard to raise operational costs  operational budgets. So  they stopped having inexpensive labor. And eventually they had to freeze their organization into something called a bastardized thruscenium. So  the second position we took is that the freedoms that we provided  the ability to move between stage configurations  had better be able to be done without relying on operational costs. Alright  Affordably. The architectural manifestation was frankly just dumb. It was to take all the things that are known as front of house and back of house and redefine them as above house and below house. At first blush you think   Hey it's crazy  what could you possibly gain   We created what we like to call superfly. Now  superfly  the concept is you take all the freedoms you normally associate with the flytower  and you smear them across flytower and auditorium. Suddenly the artistic director can move between different stage and audience configurations. And because that flytower has the ability to pick up all the pristine elements  suddenly the rest of the environment can be provisional. And you can drill  cut  nail  screw paint and replace  with a minimum of cost. But there was a third advantage that we got by doing this move that was unexpected. And that was that it freed up the perimeter of the auditorium in a most unusual way. And that provided the artistic director suddenly the ability to define suspension of disbelief. So  the building affords artistic directors the freedom to conceive of almost any kind of activity underneath this floating object. But also to challenge the notion of suspension of disbelief such that in the last act of Macbeth  if he or she wants you to associate the parable that you're seeing with Dallas  with your real life  he or she can do so. Now  in order to do this we and the clients had to do something fairly remarkable. In fact it really was the clients who had to do it. They had to make a decision  based on the positions we took to redefine the budget being from two thirds capital A architecture and one third infrastructure  to actually the inverse  two thirds infrastructure and one third capital A architecture. That's a lot for a client to commit to before you actually see the fruition of the concept. But based on the positions  they took the educated leap of faith to do so. And effectively we created what we like to call a theater machine. Now  that theater machine has ability to move between a whole series of configurations at the push of a button and a few stagehands in a short amount of time. But it also has the potential to not only provide multiform but multi processional sequences. Meaning  The artistic director doesn't necessarily need to go through our lobby. One of the things that we learned when we visited various theaters is they hate us architects  because they say the first thing they have to do  the first five minutes of any show  is they have to get our architecture out of the mind of their patron. Well now there are potentials of this building to allow the artistic director to actually move into the building without using our architecture. So  in fact  there is the building  there is what we call the draw. You're going down into our lobby  go through the lobby with our own little dangly bits  whether you like them or not  up through the stair that leads you into the auditorium. But there is also the potential to allow people to move directly from the outside  in this case suggesting kind of Wagnerian entrance  into the interior of the auditorium. And here is the fruition of that in actuality. These are the two large pivoting doors that allow people to move directly from the outside  in or from the inside  out  performers or audience alike. Now  imagine what that could be. I have to say honestly this is not something yet the building can do because it takes too long. But imagine the freedoms if you could take this further  that in fact you could consider a Wagnerian entry  a first act in thrust  an intermission in Greek  a second act in arena  and you leave through our lobby with dangly bits. Now that  I would say  is architecture performing. It is taking the hand of the architect to actually remove the hand of the architect in favor of the hand of the artistic director. I'll go through the three basic configurations. This is the flat floor configuration. You notice that there is no proscenium  the balconies have been raised up  there are no seats  the floor in the auditorium is flat. The first configuration is easy to understand. The balconies come down  you see that the orchestra begins to have a rake that's frontal towards the end stage  and the seats come in. The third configuration is a little harder to understand. Here you see that the balconies actually have to move out of the way in order to bring a thrust into the space. And some of the seats need to actually change their direction  and change their rake  to allow that to happen. I'll do it again so you can see it. There you see it's the side balconies for the proscenium. And there it is in the thrust configuration. In order to do that  again  we needed a client who was willing to take educational risks. And they told us one important thing   You shall not beta test.  Meaning  nothing that we do can we be the first ones to do it. But they were willing for us to apply technologies from other areas that already had failsafe mechanisms to this building. And the solution in terms of the balconies was to use something that we all know as a scoreboard lift. Now  if you were to take a scoreboard and drop it on dirt and whiskey  that would be bad. If you were not able to take the scoreboard out of the arena and be able to do the Ice Capades the next night  that would also be bad. And so this technology already had all the failsafe mechanisms and allowed the theater and our client to actually do this with confidence that they would be able to change over their configurations at will. The second technology that we applied was actually using things that you know from the stage side of an opera house. In this case what we're doing is we're taking the orchestra floor  lifting it up  spinning it  changing the rake  taking it back to flat floor  changing the rake again. In essence  you can begin to define rakes and viewing angles of people in the orchestra seating  at will. Here you see the chairs being spun around to go from proscenium or end stage to thrust configuration. The proscenium  also. As far as we know this is the first building in the world in which the proscenium can entirely fly out of the space. Here you see the various acoustic baffles as well as the flying mechanisms and catwalks over the auditorium. And ultimately  up in the flytower  the scene sets that allow the transformations to occur. As I said  all that was in service of creating a flexible yet affordable configuration. But we got this other benefit  and that was the ability of the perimeter to suddenly engage Dallas on the outside. Here you see the building in its current state with blinds closed. This is a trompe l'oeil. Actually this is not a curtain. These are vinyl blinds that are integrated into the windows themselves  again with failsafe mechanisms that can be lifted such that you can completely demystify  if you chose  the operations of the theater going on behind  rehearsals and so forth. But you also have the ability to allow the audience to see Dallas  to perform with Dallas as the backdrop of your performance. Now  if I'll take you through    this is an early concept sketch    take you through kind of a mixture of all these things together. Effectively you would have something like this. You would be allowed to bring objects or performers into the performing chamber   Aida   their elephants  you can bring the elephants in. You would be able to expose the auditorium to Dallas or vice versa  Dallas to the auditorium. You'd be able to open portions in order to change the procession  allow people to come in and out for an intermission  or to enter for the beginning or the end of a performance. As I said  all the balconies can move  but they can also be disappeared completely. The proscenium can fly. You can bring large objects into the chamber itself. But most convincingly when we had to confront the idea of changing costs from architecture to infrastructure  is something that is represented by this. And again  this is not all the flexibilities of the building that is actually built  but at least suggests the ideas. This building has the ability  in short order  to go back to a flat floor organization such that they can rent it out. Now  if there is anyone here from American Airlines  please consider doing your Christmas party here. That allows the company to raise operational budgets without having to compete with other venues with much larger auditoriums. That's an enormous benefit. So  the theater company has the ability to do totally hermetic  light controlled  sound controlled  great acoustics  great intimacy Shakespeare  but can also do Beckett with the skyline of Dallas sitting behind it. Here it is in a flat floor configuration. The theater has been going through its kind of paces. Here it is in an end stage configuration. It's actually beautiful. There was a rock band. We stood outside trying to see if the acoustics worked  and you could see the guys doing this but you couldn't hear them. It was very unusual. Here it is in a thrust configuration. And last but not least  you see this already has the ability to create events in order to generate operational budgets to overcome the building in fact performing to allow the company to overcome their biggest problem. I'm going to show you a brief time lapse. As I said  this can be done with only two people  and with a minimum amount of time. This is the first time that actually the changeover was done and so there is literally thousands of people because everyone was excited and wanted to be a part of it. So  in a way try to disregard all the thousands of ants running around. And think of it being done with just a few people. Again  just a couple people are required. I promise. Et voila. So  just in conclusion  a few shots. This is the AT T Performing Arts Center's Dee and Charles Wyly Theater. There it is at night. And last but not least the entire AT T Performing Arts Center. You can see the Winspear Opera House on the right and the Dee and Charles Wyly Theater on the left. And to remind you that here is an example in which architecture actually did something. But we got to that conclusion without understanding where we were going  what we knew were a series of issues that the company and the client was confronted with. And we took positions with them  and it was through those positions that we began to take architectural manifestations and we arrived at a conclusion that none of us  really none of us could ever have conceived of initially or individually. Thank you. Namaste. Good morning. I'm very happy to be here in India. And I've been thinking a lot about what I have learned over these last particularly    years with V Day and  The Vagina Monologues   traveling the world  essentially meeting with women and girls across the planet to stop violence against women. What I want to talk about today is this particular cell  or grouping of cells  that is in each and every one of us. And I want to call it the girl cell. And it's in men as well as in women. I want you to imagine that this particular grouping of cells is central to the evolution of our species and the continuation of the human race. And I want you imagine that at some point in history a group of powerful people invested in owning and controlling the world understood that the suppression of this particular cell  the oppression of these cells  the reinterpretation of these cells  the undermining of these cells  getting us to believe in the weakness of these cells and the crushing  eradicating  destroying  reducing these cells  basically began the process of killing off the girl cell  which was  by the way  patriarchy. I want you to imagine that the girl is a chip in the huge macrocosm of collective consciousness. And it is essential to balance  to wisdom and to actually the future of all of us. And then I want you to imagine that this girl cell is compassion  and it's empathy  and it's passion itself  and it's vulnerability  and it's openness  and it's intensity  and it's association  and it's relationship  and it is intuitive. And then let's think how compassion informs wisdom  and that vulnerability is our greatest strength  and that emotions have inherent logic  which lead to radical  appropriate  saving action. And then let's remember that we've been taught the exact opposite by the powers that be  that compassion clouds your thinking  that it gets in the way  that vulnerability is weakness  that emotions are not to be trusted  and you're not supposed to take things personally  which is one of my favorites. I think the whole world has essentially been brought up not to be a girl. How do we bring up boys  What does it mean to be a boy  To be a boy really means not to be a girl. To be a man means not to be a girl. To be a woman means not to be a girl. To be strong means not to be a girl. To be a leader means not to be a girl. I actually think that being a girl is so powerful that we've had to train everyone not to be that. And I'd also like to say that the irony of course  is that denying girl  suppressing girl  suppressing emotion  refusing feeling has lead thus here. Where we have now come to live in a world where the most extreme forms of violence  the most horrific poverty  genocide  mass rapes  the destruction of the Earth  is completely out of control. And because we have suppressed our girl cells and suppressed our girl ship  we do not feel what is going on. So  we are not being charged with the adequate response to what is happening. I want to talk a little bit about the Democratic Republic of Congo. For me  it was the turning point of my life. I have spent a lot of time there in the last three years. I feel up to that point I had seen a lot in the world  a lot of violence. I essentially lived in the rape mines of the world for the last    years. But the Democratic Republic of Congo really was the turning point in my soul. I went and I spent time in a place called Bukavu in a hospital called the Panzi Hospital  with a doctor who was as close to a saint as any person I've ever met. His name is Dr. Denis Mukwege. In the Congo  for those of you who don't know  there has been a war raging for the last    years  a war that has killed nearly six million people. It is estimated that somewhere between         and         women have been raped there. When I spent my first weeks at Panzi hospital I sat with women who sat and lined up every day to tell me their stories. Their stories were so horrific  and so mind blowing and so on the other side of human existence  that to be perfectly honest with you  I was shattered. And I will tell you that what happened is through that shattering  listening to the stories of eight year old girls who had their insides eviscerated  who had guns and bayonets and things shoved inside them so they had holes  literally  inside them where their pee and poop came out of them. Listening to the story of    year old women who were tied to chains and circled  and where groups of men would come and rape them periodically  all in the name of economic exploitation to steal the minerals so the West can have it and profit from them. My mind was so shattered. But what happened for me is that that shattering actually emboldened me in a way I have never been emboldened. That shattering  that opening of my girl cell  that kind of massive breakthrough of my heart allowed me to become more courageous  and braver  and actually more clever than I had been in the past in my life. I want to say that I think the powers that be know that empire building is actually    that feelings get in the way of empire building. Feelings get in the way of the mass acquisition of the Earth  and excavating the Earth  and destroying things. I remember  for example  when my father  who was very  very violent  used to beat me. And he would actually say  while he was beating me   Don't you cry. Don't you dare cry.  Because my crying somehow exposed his brutality to him. And even in the moment he didn't want to be reminded of what he was doing. I know that we have systematically annihilated the girl cell. And I want to say we've annihilated it in men as well as in women. And I think in some ways we've been much harsher to men in the annihilation of their girl cell. I see how boys have been brought up  and I see this across the planet  to be tough  to be hardened  to distance themselves from their tenderness  to not cry. I actually realized once in Kosovo  when I watched a man break down  that bullets are actually hardened tears  that when we don't allow men to have their girl self and have their vulnerability  and have their compassion  and have their hearts  that they become hardened and hurtful and violent. And I think we have taught men to be secure when they are insecure  to pretend they know things when they don't know things  or why would we be where we are  To pretend they're not a mess when they are a mess. And I will tell you a very funny story. On my way here on the airplane  I was walking up and down the aisle of the plane. And all these men  literally at least    men  were in their little seats watching chick flicks. And they were all alone  and I thought   This is the secret life of men.  I've traveled  as I said  to many  many countries  and I've seen  if we do what we do to the girl inside us then obviously it's horrific to think what we do to girls in the world. And we heard from Sunitha yesterday  and Kavita about what we do to girls. But I just want to say that I've met girls with knife wounds and cigarette burns  who are literally being treated like ashtrays. I've seen girls be treated like garbage cans. I've seen girls who were beaten by their mothers and brothers and fathers and uncles. I've seen girls starving themselves to death in America in institutions to look like some idealized version of themselves. I've seen that we cut girls and we control them and we keep them illiterate  or we make them feel bad about being too smart. We silence them. We make them feel guilty for being smart. We get them to behave  to tone it down  not to be too intense. We sell them  we kill them as embryos  we enslave them  we rape them. We are so accustomed to robbing girls of the subject of being the subjects of their lives that we have now actually objectified them and turned them into commodities. The selling of girls is rampant across the planet. And in many places they are worth less than goats and cows. But I also want to talk about the fact that if one in eight people on the planet are girls between the ages of    to     they are they key  really  in the developing world  as well as in the whole world  to the future of humanity. And if girls are in trouble because they face systematic disadvantages that keep them where society wants them to be  including lack of access to healthcare  education  healthy foods  labor force participation. The burden of all the household tasks usually falls on girls and younger siblings  which ensures that they will never overcome these barriers. The state of girls  the condition of girls  will  in my belief    and that's the girl inside us and the girl in the world    determine whether the species survives. And what I want to suggest is that  having talked to girls  because I just finished a new book called  I Am an Emotional Creature  The Secret Life of Girls Around the World   I've been talking to girls for five years  and one of the things that I've seen is true everywhere is that the verb that's been enforced on girl is the verb  to please.  Girls are trained to please. I want to change the verb. I want us all to change the verb. I want the verb to be  educate   or  activate   or  engage   or  confront   or  defy   or  create.  If we teach girls to change the verb we will actually enforce the girl inside us and the girl inside them. And I have to now share a few stories of girls I've seen across the planet who have engaged their girl  who have taken on their girl in spite of all the circumstances around them. I know a    year old girl in the Netherlands  for example  who is demanding that she take a boat and go around the entire world by herself. There is a teenage girl who just recently went out and knew that she needed    stars tattooed on the right side of her face. There is a girl  Julia Butterfly Hill  who lived for a year in a tree because she wanted to protect the wild oaks. There is a girl who I met    years ago in Afghanistan who I have adopted as my daughter because her mother was killed. Her mother was a revolutionary. And this girl  when she was    years old  wore a burqa in Afghanistan  and went into the stadiums and documented the atrocities that were going on towards women  underneath her burqa  with a video. And that video became the video that went out all over the world after      to show what was going on in Afghanistan. I want to talk about Rachel Corrie who was in her teens when she stood in front of an Israeli tank to say   End the occupation.  And she knew she risked death and she was literally gunned down and rolled over by that tank. And I want to talk about a girl that I just met recently in Bukavu  who was impregnated by her rapist. And she was holding her baby. And I asked her if she loved her baby. And she looked into her baby's eyes and she said   Of course I love my baby. How could I not love my baby  It's my baby and it's full of love.  The capacity for girls to overcome situations and to move on levels  to me  is mind blowing. There is a girl named Dorcas  and I just met her in Kenya. Dorcas is    years old  and she was trained in self defense. A few months ago she was picked up on the street by three older men. They kidnapped her  they put her in a car. And through her self defense  she grabbed their Adam's apples  she punched them in the eyes and she got herself free and out of the car. In Kenya  in August  I went to visit one of the V Day safe houses for girls  a house we opened seven years ago with an amazing woman named Agnes Pareyio. Agnes was a woman who was cut when she was a little girl  she was female genitally mutilated. And she made a decision as many women do across this planet  that what was done to her would not be enforced and done to other women and girls. So  for years Agnes walked through the Rift valley. She taught girls what a healthy vagina looked like  and what a mutilated vagina looked like. And in that time she saved many girls. And when we met her we asked her what we could do for her  and she said   Well  if you got me a Jeep I could get around a lot faster.  So  we got her a Jeep. And then she saved       girls. And then we asked her   Okay  what else do you need   And she said   Well  now  I need a house.  So  seven years ago Agnes built the first V Day safe house in Narok  Kenya  in the Masai land. And it was a house where girls could run away  they could save their clitoris  they wouldn't be cut  they could go to school. And in the years that Agnes has had the house  she has changed the situation there. She has literally become deputy mayor. She's changed the rules. The whole community has bought in to what she's doing. When we were there she was doing a ritual where she reconciles girls  who have run away  with their families. And there was a young girl named Jaclyn. Jaclyn was    years old and she was in her Masai family and there's a drought in Kenya. So cows are dying  and cows are the most valued possession. And Jaclyn overheard her father talking to an old man about how he was about to sell her for the cows. And she knew that meant she would be cut. She knew that meant she wouldn't go to school. She knew that meant she wouldn't have a future. She knew she would have to marry that old man  and she was   . So  one afternoon  she'd heard about the safe house  Jaclyn left her father's house and she walked for two days  two days through Masai land. She slept with the hyenas. She hid at night. She imagined her father killing her on one hand  and Mama Agnes greeting her  with the hope that she would greet her when she got to the house. And when she got to the house she was greeted. Agnes took her in  and Agnes loved her  and Agnes supported her for the year. She went to school and she found her voice  and she found her identity  and she found her heart. Then  her time was ready when she had to go back to talk to her father about the reconciliation  after a year. I had the privilege of being in the hut when she was reunited with her father and reconciled. In that hut  we walked in  and her father and his four wives were sitting there  and her sisters who had just returned because they had all fled when she had fled  and her primary mother  who had been beaten in standing up for her with the elders. When her father saw her and saw who she had become  in her full girl self  he threw his arms around her and broke down crying. He said   You are beautiful. You have grown into a gorgeous woman. We will not cut you. And I give you my word  here and now  that we will not cut your sisters either.  And what she said to him was   You were willing to sell me for four cows  and a calf and some blankets. But I promise you  now that I will be educated I will always take care of you  and I will come back and I will build you a house. And I will be in your corner for the rest of your life.  For me  that is the power of girls. And that is the power of transformation. I want to close today with a new piece from my book. And I want to do it tonight for the girl in everybody here. And I want to do it for Sunitha. And I want to do it for the girls that Sunitha talked about yesterday  the girls who survive  the girls who can become somebody else. But I really want to do it for each and every person here  to value the girl in us  to value the part that cries  to value the part that's emotional  to value the part that's vulnerable  to understand that's where the future lies. This is called  I'm An Emotional Creature.  And it happened because I met a girl in Watts  L.A. I was asking girls if they like being a girl  and all the girls were like   No  I hate it. I can't stand it. It's all bad. My brothers get everything.  And this girl just sat up and went   I love being a girl. I'm an emotional creature   This is for her  I love being a girl. I can feel what you're feeling as you're feeling inside the feeling before. I am an emotional creature. Things do not come to me as intellectual theories or hard pressed ideas. They pulse through my organs and legs and burn up my ears. Oh  I know when your girlfriend's really pissed off  even though she appears to give you what you want. I know when a storm is coming. I can feel the invisible stirrings in the air. I can tell you he won't call back. It's a vibe I share. I am an emotional creature. I love that I do not take things lightly. Everything is intense to me  the way I walk in the street  the way my momma wakes me up  the way it's unbearable when I lose  the way I hear bad news. I am an emotional creature. I am connected to everything and everyone. I was born like that. Don't you say all negative that it's only only a teenage thing  or it's only because I'm a girl. These feelings make me better. They make me present. They make me ready. They make me strong. I am an emotional creature. There is a particular way of knowing. It's like the older women somehow forgot. I rejoice that it's still in my body. Oh  I know when the coconut's about to fall. I know we have pushed the Earth too far. I know my father isn't coming back  and that no one's prepared for the fire. I know that lipstick means more than show  and boys are super insecure  and so called terrorists are made  not born. I know that one kiss could take away all my decision making ability. And you know what  Sometimes it should. This is not extreme. It's a girl thing  what we would all be if the big door inside us flew open. Don't tell me not to cry  to calm it down  not to be so extreme  to be reasonable. I am an emotional creature. It's how the earth got made  how the wind continues to pollinate. You don't tell the Atlantic Ocean to behave. I am an emotional creature. Why would you want to shut me down or turn me off  I am your remaining memory. I can take you back. Nothing's been diluted. Nothing's leaked out. I love  hear me  I love that I can feel the feelings inside you  even if they stop my life  even if they break my heart  even if they take me off track  they make me responsible. I am an emotional  I am an emotional  incondotional  devotional creature. And I love  hear me  I love  love  love being a girl. Can you say it with me  I love  I love  love  love being a girl  Thank you very much. Please close your eyes  and open your hands. Now imagine what you could place in your hands  an apple  maybe your wallet. Now open your eyes. What about a life  What you see here is a premature baby. He looks like he's resting peacefully  but in fact he's struggling to stay alive because he can't regulate his own body temperature. This baby is so tiny he doesn't have enough fat on his body to stay warm. Sadly     million babies like this are born every year around the world. Four million of these babies die annually. But the bigger problem is that the ones who do survive grow up with severe  long term health problems. The reason is because in the first month of a baby's life  its only job is to grow. If it's battling hypothermia  its organs can't develop normally  resulting in a range of health problems from diabetes  to heart disease  to low I.Q. Imagine  Many of these problems could be prevented if these babies were just kept warm. That is the primary function of an incubator. But traditional incubators require electricity and cost up to    thousand dollars. So  you're not going to find them in rural areas of developing countries. As a result  parents resort to local solutions like tying hot water bottles around their babies' bodies  or placing them under light bulbs like the ones you see here    methods that are both ineffective and unsafe. I've seen this firsthand over and over again. On one of my first trips to India  I met this young woman  Sevitha  who had just given birth to a tiny premature baby  Rani. She took her baby to the nearest village clinic  and the doctor advised her to take Rani to a city hospital so she could be placed in an incubator. But that hospital was over four hours away  and Sevitha didn't have the means to get there  so her baby died. Inspired by this story  and dozens of other similar stories like this  my team and I realized what was needed was a local solution  something that could work without electricity  that was simple enough for a mother or a midwife to use  given that the majority of births still take place in the home. We needed something that was portable  something that could be sterilized and reused across multiple babies and something ultra low cost  compared to the        dollars that an incubator in the U.S. costs. So  this is what we came up with. What you see here looks nothing like an incubator. It looks like a small sleeping bag for a baby. You can open it up completely. It's waterproof. There's no seams inside so you can sterilize it very easily. But the magic is in this pouch of wax. This is a phase change material. It's a wax like substance with a melting point of human body temperature     degrees Celsius. You can melt this simply using hot water and then when it melts it's able to maintain one constant temperature for four to six hours at a time  after which you simply reheat the pouch. So  you then place it into this little pocket back here  and it creates a warm micro environment for the baby. Looks simple  but we've reiterated this dozens of times by going into the field to talk to doctors  moms and clinicians to ensure that this really meets the needs of the local communities. We plan to launch this product in India in       and the target price point will be    dollars  less than  .  percent of the cost of a traditional incubator. Over the next five years we hope to save the lives of almost a million babies. But the longer term social impact is a reduction in population growth. This seems counterintuitive  but turns out that as infant mortality is reduced  population sizes also decrease  because parents don't need to anticipate that their babies are going to die. We hope that the Embrace infant warmer and other simple innovations like this represent a new trend for the future of technology  simple  localized  affordable solutions that have the potential to make huge social impact. In designing this we followed a few basic principles. We really tried to understand the end user  in this case  people like Sevitha. We tried to understand the root of the problem rather than being biased by what already exists. And then we thought of the most simple solution we could to address this problem. In doing this  I believe we can truly bring technology to the masses. And we can save millions of lives through the simple warmth of an Embrace. So  imagine you're standing on a street anywhere in America and a Japanese man comes up to you and says   Excuse me  what is the name of this block   And you say   I'm sorry  well  this is Oak Street  that's Elm Street. This is   th  that's   th.  He says   OK  but what is the name of that block   You say   Well  blocks don't have names. Streets have names  blocks are just the unnamed spaces in between streets.  He leaves  a little confused and disappointed. So  now imagine you're standing on a street  anywhere in Japan  you turn to a person next to you and say   Excuse me  what is the name of this street   They say   Oh  well that's Block    and this is Block   .  And you say   OK  but what is the name of this street   And they say   Well  streets don't have names. Blocks have names. Just look at Google Maps here. There's Block                       . All of these blocks have names  and the streets are just the unnamed spaces in between the blocks. And you say then   OK  then how do you know your home address   He said   Well  easy  this is District Eight. There's Block     house number one.  You say   OK  but walking around the neighborhood  I noticed that the house numbers don't go in order.  He says   Of course they do. They go in the order in which they were built. The first house ever built on a block is house number one. The second house ever built is house number two. Third is house number three. It's easy. It's obvious.  So  I love that sometimes we need to go to the opposite side of the world to realize assumptions we didn't even know we had  and realize that the opposite of them may also be true. So  for example  there are doctors in China who believe that it's their job to keep you healthy. So  any month you are healthy you pay them  and when you're sick you don't have to pay them because they failed at their job. They get rich when you're healthy  not sick. In most music  we think of the  one  as the downbeat  the beginning of the musical phrase  one  two  three  four. But in West African music  the  one  is thought of as the end of the phrase  like the period at the end of a sentence. So  you can hear it not just in the phrasing  but the way they count off their music  two  three  four  one. And this map is also accurate. There's a saying that whatever true thing you can say about India  the opposite is also true. So  let's never forget  whether at TED  or anywhere else  that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear  that the opposite may also be true. Domo arigato gozaimashita. As a researcher  every once in a while you encounter something a little disconcerting. And this is something that changes your understanding of the world around you  and teaches you that you're very wrong about something that you really believed firmly in. And these are unfortunate moments  because you go to sleep that night dumber than when you woke up. So  that's really the goal of my talk  is to A  communicate that moment to you and B  have you leave this session a little dumber than when you entered. So  I hope I can really accomplish that. So  this incident that I'm going to describe really began with some diarrhea. Now  we've known for a long time the cause of diarrhea. That's why there's a glass of water up there. For us  it's a problem  the people in this room. For babies  it's deadly. They lack nutrients  and diarrhea dehydrates them. And so  as a result  there is a lot of death  a lot of death. In India in       there was a    percent child mortality rate  lots of people didn't make it. This is incredibly unfortunate. One of the big reasons this happened was because of diarrhea. Now  there was a big effort to solve this problem  and there was actually a big solution. This solution has been called  by some   potentially the most important medical advance this century.  Now  the solution turned out to be simple. And what it was was oral rehydration salts. Many of you have probably used this. It's brilliant. It's a way to get sodium and glucose together so that when you add it to water the child is able to absorb it even during situations of diarrhea. Remarkable impact on mortality. Massive solution to the problem. Flash forward           percent child mortality has dropped to  .  percent today. Still a big number  but a big drop. It looks like the technological problem is solved. But if you look  even today there are about         diarrhea related deaths in India alone. What's going on here  Well the easy answer is  we just haven't gotten those salts to those people. That's actually not true. If you look in areas where these salts are completely available  the price is low or zero  these deaths still continue abated. Maybe there's a biological answer. Maybe these are the deaths that simple rehydration alone doesn't solve. That's not true either. Many of these deaths were completely preventable  and this what I want to think of as the disconcerting thing  what I want to call  the last mile  problem. See  we spent a lot of energy  in many domains    technological  scientific  hard work  creativity  human ingenuity    to crack important social problems with technology solutions. That's been the discoveries of the last       years  that's mankind moving forward. But in this case we cracked it  but a big part of the problem still remains. Nine hundred and ninety nine miles went well  the last mile's proving incredibly stubborn. Now  that's for oral rehydration therapy. Maybe this is something unique about diarrhea. Well  it turns out    and this is where things get really disconcerting    it's not unique to diarrhea. It's not even unique to poor people in India. Here's an example from a variety of contexts. I've put a bunch of examples up here. I'll start with insulin  diabetes medication in the U.S. OK  the American population. On Medicaid    if you're fairly poor you get Medicaid  or if you have health insurance    insulin is pretty straightforward. You get it  either in pill form or you get it as an injection  you have to take it every day to maintain your blood sugar levels. Massive technological advance  took an incredibly deadly disease  made it solvable. Adherence rates. How many people are taking their insulin every day  About on average  a typical person is taking it    percent of the time. As a result         people a year go blind  hundreds of thousands lose limbs  every year  for something that's solvable. Here I have a bunch of other examples  all suffer from the last mile problem. It's not just medicine. Here's another example from technology  agriculture. We think there's a food problem  so we create new seeds. We think there's an income problem  so we create new ways of farming that increase income. Well  look at some old ways  some ways that we'd already cracked. Intercropping. Intercropping really increases income. Sometimes in rice we found incredible increases in yield when you mix different varieties of rice side by side. Some people are doing that  many are not. What's going on  This is the last mile. The last mile is  everywhere  problematic. Alright  what's the problem  The problem is this little three pound machine that's behind your eyes and between your ears. This machine is really strange  and one of the consequences is that people are weird. They do lots of inconsistent things. They do lots of inconsistent things. And the inconsistencies create  fundamentally  this last mile problem. See  when we were dealing with our biology  bacteria  the genes  the things inside here  the blood  That's complex  but it's manageable. When we're dealing with people like this  The mind is more complex. That's not as manageable  and that's what we're struggling with. Let me go back to diarrhea for a second. Here's a question that was asked in the National Sample Survey  which is a survey asked of many Indian women   Your child has diarrhea. Should you increase  maintain or decrease the number of fluids   Just so you don't embarrass yourselves  I'll give you the right answer  It's increase. Now  diarrhea's interesting because it's been around for thousands of years  ever since humankind really lived side by side enough to have really polluted water. One Roman strategy that was very interesting was that    and it really gave them a comparative advantage    they made sure their soldiers didn't drink even remotely muddied waters. Because if some of your troops get diarrhea they're not that effective on the battlefield. So  if you think of Roman comparative advantage part of it was the breast shields  the breastplates  but part of it was drinking the right water. So  here are these women. They've seen their parents have struggled with diarrhea  they've struggled with diarrhea  they've seen lots of deaths. How do they answer this question  In India     to    percent say  Reduce.  Think about what that means for a second. Thirty five to    percent of women forget oral rehydration therapy  they are increasing    they are actually making their child more likely to die through their actions. How is that possible  Well  one possibility    I think that's how most people respond to this    is to say   That's just stupid.  I don't think that's stupid. I think there is something very profoundly right in what these women are doing. And that is  you don't put water into a leaky bucket. So  think of the mental model that goes behind reducing the intake. Just doesn't make sense. Now  the model is intuitively right. It just doesn't happen to be right about the world. But it makes a whole lot of sense at some deep level. And that  to me  is the fundamental challenge of the last mile. This first challenge is what I refer to as the persuasion challenge. Convincing people to do something    take oral rehydration therapy  intercrop  whatever it might be    is not an act of information   Let's give them the data  and when they have data they'll do the right thing.  It's more complex than that. And if you want to understand how it's more complex let me start with something kind of interesting. I'm going to give you a little math problem  and I want you to just yell out the answer as fast as possible. A bat and a ball together cost   .  . The bat costs a dollar more than the ball. How much does the ball cost  Quick. So  somebody out there says   Five.  A lot of you said   Ten.  Let's think about    for a second. If the ball costs     the bat costs... this is easy    .  . Yeah. So  together they would cost   .  . So  here you all are  ostensibly educated people. Most of you look smart. The combination of that produces something that is actually  you got this thing wrong. How is that possible  Let's go to something else. I know algebra can be complicated. So  let's dial this back. That's what  Fifth grade  Fourth grade  Let's go back to kindergarten. OK  There's a great show on American television that you have to watch. It's called  Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader   I think we've learned the answer to that here. Let's move to kindergarten. Let's see if we can beat five year olds. Here's what I'm going to do  I'm going to put objects on the screen. I just want you to name the color of the object. That's all it is. OK  I want you to do it fast  and say it out loud with me  and do it quickly. I'll make the first one easy for you. Ready  Black. Now the next ones I want you to do quickly and say it out loud. Ready  Go. Audience  Red. Green. Yellow. Blue. Red. Sendhil Mullainathan  That's pretty good. Almost out of kindergarten. What is all this telling us  You see  what's going on here  and in the bat and ball problem is that you have some intuitive ways of interacting with the world  some models that you use to understand the world. These models  like the leaky bucket  work well in most situations. I suspect most of you    I hope that's true for the rest of you    actually do pretty well with addition and subtraction in the real world. I found a problem  a specific problem that actually found an error with that. Diarrhea  and many last mile problems  are like that. They are situations where the mental model doesn't match the reality. Same thing here  You had an intuitive response to this that was very quick. You read  blue  and you wanted to say  blue   even though you knew your task was red. Now  I do this stuff because it's fun. But it's more profound than fun. I'll give you a good example of how it actually effects persuasion. BMW is a pretty safe car. And they are trying to figure out   Safety is good. I want to advertise safety. How am I going to advertise safety    I could give people numbers. We do well on crash tests.  But the truth of the matter is  you look at that car  it doesn't look like a Volvo  and it doesn't look like a Hummer. So  what I want you to think about for a few minutes is  How would you convey safety of the BMW  Okay  So now  while you're thinking about that let's move to a second task. The second task is fuel efficiency. Okay  Here's another puzzle for all of you. One person walks into a car lot  and they're thinking about buying this Toyota Yaris. They are saying   This is    miles per gallon. I'm going to do the environmentally right thing  I'm going to buy the Prius     miles per gallon.  Another person walks into the lot  and they're about to buy a Hummer  nine miles per gallon  fully loaded  luxury. And they say   You know what  Do I need turbo  Do I need this heavyweight car   I'm going to do something good for the environment. I'm going to take off some of that weight  and I'm going to buy a Hummer that's    miles per gallon.  Which one of these people has done more for the environment  See  you have a mental model. Fifty versus     that's a big move. Eleven versus nine  Come on. Turns out  go home and do the math  the nine to    is a bigger change. That person has saved more gallons. Why  Because we don't care about miles per gallon  we care about gallons per mile. Think about how powerful that is if you're trying to encourage fuel efficiency. Miles per gallon is the way we present things. If we want to encourage change of behavior  gallons per mile would have far more effectiveness. Researchers have found these type of anomalies. Okay  back to BMW. What should they do  The problem BMW faces is this car looks safe. This car  which is my Mini  doesn't look that safe. Here was BMW's brilliant insight  which they embodied into an ad campaign. They showed a BMW driving down the street. There's a truck on the right. Boxes fall out of the truck. The car swerves to avoid it  and therefore doesn't get into an accident. BWM realizes safety  in people's minds  has two components. You can be safe because when you're hit  you survive  or you can be safe because you avoid accidents. Remarkably successful campaign  but notice the power of it. It harnesses something you already believe. Now  even if I persuaded you to do something  it's hard sometimes to actually get action as a result. You all probably intended to wake up  I don't know          a.m. This is a battle we all fight every day  along with trying to get to the gym. Now  this is an example of that battle  and makes us realize intentions don't always translate into action  and so one of the fundamental challenges is how we would actually do that. OK  So  let me now talk about the last mile problem. So far  I've been pretty negative. I've been trying to show you the oddities of human behavior. And I think maybe I'm being too negative. Maybe it's the diarrhea. Maybe the last mile problem really should be thought of as the last mile opportunity. Let's go back to diabetes. This is a typical insulin injection. Now  carrying this thing around is complicated. You gotta carry the bottle  you gotta carry the syringe. It's also painful. Now  you may think to yourself   Well  if my eyes depended on it  you know  I would obviously use it every day.  But the pain  the discomfort  you know  paying attention  remembering to put it in your purse when you go on a long trip  These are the day to day of life  and they do pose problems. Here is an innovation  a design innovation. This is a pen  it's called an insulin pen  preloaded. The needle is particularly sharp. You just gotta carry this thing around. It's much easier to use  much less painful. Anywhere between five and    percent increase in adherence  just as a result of this. That's what I'm talking about as a last mile opportunity. You see  we tend to think the problem is solved when we solve the technology problem. But the human innovation  the human problem still remains  and that's a great frontier that we have left. This isn't about the biology of people  this is now about the brains  the psychology of people  and innovation needs to continue all the way through the last mile. Here's another example of this. This is from a company called Positive Energy. This is about energy efficiency. We're spending a lot of time on fuel cells right now. What this company does is they send a letter to households that say   Here's your energy use  here's your neighbor's energy use  You're doing well.  Smiley face.  You're doing worse.  Frown. And what they find is just this letter  nothing else  has a two to three percent reduction in electricity use. And you want to think about the social value of that in terms of carbon offsets  reduced electricity      million dollars per year. Why  Because for free  this isn't a new technology  this is a letter    we're getting a Big Bang in behavior. So  how do we tackle the last mile  I think this tells us there is an opportunity. And I think to tackle it  we need to combine psychology  marketing  art  we've seen that. But you know what we need to combine it with  We need to combine this with the scientific method. See what's really puzzling and frustrating about the last mile  to me  is that the first     miles are all about science. No one would say   Hey  I think this medicine works  go ahead and use it.  We have testing  we go to the lab  we try it again  we have refinement. But you know what we do on the last mile   Oh  this is a good idea. People will like this. Let's put it out there.  The amount of resources we put in are disparate. We put billions of dollars into fuel efficient technologies. How much are we putting into energy behavior change in a credible  systematic  testing way  Now  I think that we're on the verge of something big. We're on the verge of a whole new social science. It's a social science that recognizes    much like science recognizes the complexity of the body  biology recognizes the complexity of the body    we'll recognize the complexity of the human mind. The careful testing  retesting  design  are going to open up vistas of understanding  complexities  difficult things. And those vistas will both create new science  and fundamental change in the world as we see it  in the next hundred years. All right. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Sendhil  thank you so much. So  this whole area is so fascinating. I mean  it sometimes feels  listening to behavioral economists that they are kind of putting into place academically  what great marketers have sort of intuitively known for a long time. How much is your field talking to great marketers about their insights into human psychology  Because they've seen it on the ground. Sendhil Mullainathan  Yeah  we spend a lot of time talking to marketers  and I think    percent of it is exactly what you say  there are insights to be gleaned there. Forty percent of it is about what marketing is. Marketing is selling an ad to a firm. So  in some sense  a lot of marketing is about convincing a CEO   This is a good ad campaign.  So  there is a little bit of slippage there. That's just a caveat. That's different from actually having an effective ad campaign. And one of the new movements in marketing is  How do we actually measure effectiveness  Are we effective  CA  How you take your insights here and actually get them integrated into working business models on the ground  in Indian villages  for example  SM  So  the scientific method I alluded to is pretty important. We work closely with companies that have operational capacity  or nonprofits that have operational capacity. And then we say   Well  you want to get this behavior change. Let's come up with a few ideas  test them  see which is working  go back  synthesize  and try to come up with a thing that works   and then we're able to scale with partners. It's kind of the model that has worked in other contexts. If you have biological problems we try and fix it  see if it works  and then work the scale. CA  Alright Sendhil  thanks so much for coming to TED. Thank you. When my brother called me in December of       he said   The news does not look good.  This is him on the screen. He'd just been diagnosed with ALS  which is a disease that the average lifespan is three years. It paralyzes you. It starts by killing the motor neurons in your spinal cord. And you go from being a healthy  robust    year old male to someone that cannot breathe  cannot move  cannot speak. This has actually been  to me  a gift  because we began a journey to learn a new way of thinking about life. And even though Steven passed away three years ago we had an amazing journey as a family. We did not even    I think adversity is not even the right word. We looked at this and we said   We're going to do something with this in an incredibly positive way.  And I want to talk today about one of the things that we decided to do  which was to think about a new way of approaching healthcare. Because  as we all know here today  it doesn't work very well. I want to talk about it in the context of a story. This is the story of my brother. But it's just a story. And I want to go beyond the story  and go to something more.  Given my status  what is the best outcome I can hope to achieve  and how do I get there   is what we are here to do in medicine  is what everyone should do. And those questions all have variables to them. All of our statuses are different. All of our hopes and dreams  what we want to accomplish  is different  and our paths will be different  they are all stories. But it's a story until we convert it to data and so what we do  this concept we had  was to take Steven's status   What is my status   and go from this concept of walking  breathing  and then his hands  speak  and ultimately happiness and function. So  the first set of pathologies  they end up in the stick man on his icon  but the rest of them are really what's important here. Because Steven  despite the fact that he was paralyzed  as he was in that pool  he could not walk  he could not use his arms    that's why he had the little floaty things on them  did you see those     he was happy. We were at the beach  he was raising his son  and he was productive. And we took this  and we converted it into data. But it's not a data point at that one moment in time. It is a data point of Steven in a context. Here he is in the pool. But here he is healthy  as a builder  taller  stronger  got all the women  amazing guy. Here he is walking down the aisle  but he can barely walk now  so it's impaired. And he could still hold his wife's hand  but he couldn't do buttons on his clothes  can't feed himself. And here he is  paralyzed completely  unable to breathe and move  over this time journey. These stories of his life  converted to data. He renovated my carriage house when he was completely paralyzed  and unable to speak  and unable to breathe  and he won an award for a historic restoration. So  here's Steven alone  sharing this story in the world. And this is the insight  the thing that we are excited about  because we have gone away from the community that we are  the fact that we really do love each other and want to care for each other. We need to give to others to be successful. So  Steven is sharing this story  but he is not alone. There are so many other people sharing their stories. Not stories in words  but stories in data and words. And we convert that information into this structure  this understanding  this ability to convert those stories into something that is computable  to which we can begin to change the way medicine is done and delivered. We did this for ALS. We can do this for depression  Parkinson's disease  HIV. These are not simple  they are not internet scalable  they require thought and processes to find the meaningful information about the disease. So  this is what it looks like when you go to the website. And I'm going to show you what Patients Like Me  the company that myself  my youngest brother and a good friend from MIT started. Here are the actual patients  there are        of them now  sharing their stories as data. Here is an M.S. patient. His name is Mike  and he is uniformly impaired on cognition  vision  walking  sensation. Those are things that are different for each M.S. patient. Each of them can have a different characteristic. You can see fibromyalgia  HIV  ALS  depression. Look at this HIV patient down here  Zinny. It's two years of this disease. All of the symptoms are not there. But he is working to keep his CD  count high and his viral level low so he can make his life better. But you can aggregate this and you can discover things about treatments. Look at this        people almost  on Copaxone. These are patients currently on drugs  sharing data. I love some of these  physical exercise  prayer. Anyone want to run a comparative effectiveness study on prayer against something  Let's look at prayer. What I love about this  just sort of interesting design problems. These are why people pray. Here is the schedule of how frequently they    it's a dose. So  anyone want to see the    patients that pray for    minutes a day  and see if they're doing better  they probably are. Here they are. It's an open network  everybody is sharing. We can see it all. Or  I want to look at anxiety  because people are praying for anxiety. And here is data on        people's current anxiety  right now. How they treat it  the drugs  the components of it  their side effects  all of it in a rich environment  and you can drill down and see the individuals. This amazing data allows us to drill down and see what this drug is for          people on this drug  I think. Yes. I want to talk to the    patients down here who are taking four milligrams a day. And I want to talk to the ones of those that have been doing it for more than two years. So  you can see the duration. All open  all available. I'm going to log in. And this is my brother's profile. And this is a new version of our platform we're launching right now. This is the second generation. It's going to be in Flash. And you can see here  as this animates over  Steven's actual data against the background of all other patients  against this information. The blue band is the   th percentile. Steven is the   th percentile  that he has non genetic ALS. You scroll down in this profile and you can see all of his prescription drugs  but more than that  in the new version  I can look at this interactively. Wait  poor spinal capacity. Doesn't this remind you of a great stock program  Wouldn't it be great if the technology we used to take care of ourselves was as good as the technology we use to make money  Detrol. In the side effects for his drug  integrated into that  the stem cell transplant that he had  the first in the world  shared openly for anyone who wants to see it. I love here    the cyberkinetics implant  which was  again  the only patient's data that was online and available. You can adjust the time scale. You can adjust the symptoms. You can look at the interaction between how I treat my ALS. So  you click down on the ALS tab there. I'm taking three drugs to manage it. Some of them are experimental. I can look at my constipation  how to manage it. I can see magnesium citrate  and the side effects from that drug all integrated in the time in which they're meaningful. But I want more. I don't want to just look at this cool device  I want to take this data and make something even better. I want my brother's center of the universe and his symptoms and his drugs  and all of the things that interact among those  the side effects  to be in this beautiful data galaxy that we can look at in any way we want to understand it  so that we can take this information and go beyond just this simple model of what a record is. I don't even know what a medical record is. I want to solve a problem. I want an application. So  can I take this data    rearrange yourself  put the symptoms in the left  the drugs across the top  tell me everything we know about Steven and everyone else  and what interacts. Years after he's had these drugs  I learned that everything he did to manage his excess saliva  including some positive side effects that came from other drugs  were making his constipation worse. And if anyone's ever had severe constipation  and you don't understand how much of an impact that has on your life    yes  that was a pun. You're trying to manage these  and this grid is available here  and we want to understand it. No one's ever had this kind of information. So  patients have this. We're for patients. This is all about patient health care  there was no doctors on our network. This is about the patients. So  how can we take this and bring them a tool that they can go back and they can engage the medical system  And we worked hard  and we thought about it and we said   What's something we can use all the time  that we can use in the medical care system  that everyone will understand   So  the patients print it out  because hospitals usually block us because they believe we are a social network. It's actually the most used feature on the website. Doctors actually love this sheet  and they're actually really engaged. So  we went from this story of Steven and his history to data  and then back to paper  where we went back and engaged the medical care system. And here's another paper. This is a journal  PNAS    I think it's the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science of the United States of America. You've seen multiple of these today  when everyone's bragging about the amazing things they've done. This is a report about a drug called lithium. Lithium  that is a drug used to treat bipolar disorder  that a group in Italy found slowed ALS down in    patients  and published it. Now  we'll skip the critiques of the paper. But the short story is  If you're a patient  you want to be on the blue line. You don't want to be on the red line  you want to be on the blue line. Because the blue line is a better line. The red line is way downhill  the blue line is a good line. So  you know we said    we looked at this  and what I love also is that people always accuse these Internet sites of promoting bad medicine and having people do things irresponsibly. So  this is what happened when PNAS published this. Ten percent of the people in our system took lithium. Ten percent of the patients started taking lithium based on    patients of data in a bad publication. And they call the Internet irresponsible. Here's the implication of what happens. There's this one guy  named Humberto  from Brazil  who unfortunately passed away nine months ago  who said   Hey  listen. Can you help us answer this question  Because I don't want to wait for the next trial  it's going to be years. I want to know now. Can you help us   So  we launched some tools  we let them track their blood levels. We let them share the data and exchange it. You know  a data network. And they said  you know   Jamie  PLM  can you guys tell us whether this works or not   And we went around and we talked to people  and they said   You can't run a clinical trial like this. You know  You don't have the blinding  you don't have data  it doesn't follow the scientific method. It's never going to work. You can't do it.  So  I said   Okay well we can't do that. Then we can do something harder.  I can't say whether lithium works in all ALS patients  but I can say whether it works in Humberto. I bought a Mac about two years ago  I converted over  and I was so excited about this new feature of the time machine that came in Leopard. And we said    because it's really cool  you can go back and you can look at the entire history of your computer  and find everything you've lost  and I loved it. And I said   What if we built a time machine for patients  except instead of going backwards  we go forwards. Can we find out what's going to happen to you  so that you can maybe change it   So  we did. We took all the patients like Humberto  That's the Apple background  we stole that because we didn't have time to build our own. This is a real app by the way. This is not just graphics. And you take those data  and we find the patients like him  and we bring their data together. And we bring their histories into it. And then we say   Well how do we line them all up   So  we line them all up so they go together around the meaningful points  integrated across everything we know about the patient. Full information  the entire course of their disease. And that's what is going to happen to Humberto  unless he does something. And he took lithium  and he went down the line. And it works almost every time. Now  the ones that it doesn't work are interesting. But almost all the time it works. It's actually scary. It's beautiful. So  we couldn't run a clinical trial  we couldn't figure it out. But we could see whether it was going to work for Humberto. And yeah  all the clinicians in the audience will talk about power and all the standard deviation. We'll do that later. But here is the answer of the mean of the patients that actually decided to take lithium. These are all the patients that started lithium. It's the Intent to Treat Curve. You can see here  the blue dots on the top  the light ones  those are the people in the study in PNAS that you wanted to be on. And the red ones are the ones  the pink ones on the bottom are the ones you didn't want to be. And the ones in the middle are all of our patients from the start of lithium at time zero  going forward  and then going backward. So  you can see we matched them perfectly  perfectly. Terrifyingly accurate matching. And going forward  you actually don't want to be a lithium patient this time. You're actually doing slightly worse    not significantly  but slightly worse. You don't want to be a lithium patient this time. But you know  a lot of people dropped out  the trial  there is too much drop out. Can we do the even harder thing  Can we go to the patients that actually decided to stay on lithium  because they were so convinced they were getting better  We asked our control algorithm  are those    patients    by the way  you'll notice that's four times the number of patients in the clinical trial    can we look at those patients and say   Can we match them with our time machine to the other patients that are just like them  and what happens   Even the ones that believed they were getting better matched the controls exactly. Exactly. Those little lines  That's the power. So  we    I can't tell you lithium doesn't work. I can't tell you that if you did it at a higher dose or if you run the study proper    I can tell you that for those    people that took lithium  they didn't do any better than the people that were just like them  just like me  and that we had the power to detect that at about a quarter of the strengths reported in the initial study. We did that one year ahead of the time when the first clinical trial funded by the NIH for millions of dollars failed for futility last week  and announced it. So  remember I told you about my brother's stem cell transplant. I never really knew whether it worked. And I put     million cells in his cisterna magna  in his lumbar cord  and filled out the IRBs and did all this work  and I never really knew. How did I not know  I mean  I didn't know what was going to happen to him. I actually asked Tim  who is the quant in our group    we actually searched for about a year to find someone who could do the sort of math and statistics and modeling in healthcare  couldn't find anybody. So  we went to the finance industry. And there are these guys who used to model the future of interest rates  and all that kind of stuff. And some of them were available. So  we hired one. We hired them  set them up  assisting at lab. I I.M. him things. That's the way I communicate with him  is like a little guy in a box. I I.M.ed Tim. I said   Tim can you tell me whether my brother's stem cell transplant worked or not   And he sent me this two days ago. It was that little outliers there. You see that guy that lived a long time  We have to go talk to him. Because I'd like to know what happened. Because something went different. But my brother didn't. My brother went straight down the line. It only works about    months. It's the first version of the time machine. First time we ever tried it. We'll try to get it better later but    months so far. And  you know  I look at this  and I get really emotional. You look at the patients  you can drill in all the controls  you can look at them  you can ask them. And I found a woman that had    we found her  she was odd because she had data after she died. And her husband had come in and entered her last functional scores  because he knew how much she cared. And I am thankful. I can't believe that these people  years after my brother had died  helped me answer the question about whether an operation I did  and spent millions of dollars on years ago  worked or not. I wished it had been there when I'd done it the first time  and I'm really excited that it's here now  because the lab that I founded has some data on a drug that might work  and I'd like to show it. I'd like to show it in real time  now  and I want to do that for all of the diseases that we can do that for. I've got to thank the        people that are doing this social experiment with us. There is an amazing journey we are going on to become human again  to be part of community again  to share of ourselves  to be vulnerable  and it's very exciting. So  thank you. The problem that I want to talk with you about is really the problem of  How does one supply healthcare in a world in which cost is everything  How do you do that  And the basic paradigm we want to suggest to you  I want to suggest to you  is one in which you say that in order to treat disease you have to first know what you're treating    that's diagnostics    and then you have to do something. So  the program that we're involved in is something which we call Diagnostics for All  or zero cost diagnostics. How do you provide medically relevant information at as close as possible to zero cost  How do you do it  Let me just give you two examples. The rigors of military medicine are not so dissimilar from the third world    poor resources  a rigorous environment  a series of problems in lightweight  and things of this kind    and also not so different from the home healthcare and diagnostic system world. So  the technology that I want to talk about is for the third world  for the developing world  but it has  I think  much broader application  because information is so important in the healthcare system. So  you see two examples here. One is a lab that is actually a fairly high end laboratory in Africa. The second is basically an entrepreneur who is set up and doing who knows what in a table in a market. I don't know what kind of healthcare is delivered there. But it's not really what is probably most efficient. What is our approach  And the way in which one typically approaches a problem of lowering cost  starting from the perspective of the United States  is to take our solution  and then to try to cut cost out of it. No matter how you do that  you're not going to start with a         dollar instrument and bring it down to no cost. It isn't going to work. So  the approach that we took was the other way around. To ask   What is the cheapest possible stuff that you could make a diagnostic system out of  and get useful information  add function   And what we've chosen is paper. What you see here is a prototypic device. It's about a centimeter on the side. It's about the size of a fingernail. The lines around the edges are a polymer. It's made of paper and paper  of course  wicks fluid  as you know  paper  cloth    drop wine on the tablecloth  and the wine wicks all over everything. Put it on your shirt  it ruins the shirt. That's what a hydrophilic surface does. So  in this device the idea is that you drip the bottom end of it in a drop of  in this case  urine. The fluid wicks its way into those chambers at the top. The brown color indicates the amount of glucose in the urine  the blue color indicates the amount of protein in the urine. And the combination of those two is a first order shot at a number of useful things that you want. So  this is an example of a device made from a simple piece of paper. Now  how simple can you make the production  Why do we choose paper  There's an example of the same thing on a finger  showing you basically what it looks like. One reason for using paper is that it's everywhere. We have made these kinds of devices using napkins and toilet paper and wraps  and all kinds of stuff. So  the production capability is there. The second is  you can put lots and lots of tests in a very small place. I'll show you in a moment that the stack of paper there would probably hold something like         tests  something of that kind. And then finally  a point that you don't think of so much in developed world medicine  it eliminates sharps. And what sharps means is needles  things that stick. If you've taken a sample of someone's blood and the someone might have hepatitis C  you don't want to make a mistake and stick it in you. It just    you don't want to do that. So  how do you dispose of that  It's a problem everywhere. And here you simply burn it. So  it's a sort of a practical approach to starting on things. Now  you say   If paper is a good idea  other people have surely thought of it.  And the answer is  of course  yes. Those half of you  roughly  who are women  at some point may have had a pregnancy test. And the most common of these is in a device that looks like the thing on the left. It's something called a lateral flow immunoassay. In that particular test  urine either  containing a hormone called HCG  does or does not flow across a piece of paper. And there are two bars. One bar indicates that the test is working  and if the second bar shows up  you're pregnant. This is a terrific kind of test in a binary world  and the nice thing about pregnancy is either you are pregnant or you're not pregnant. You're not partially pregnant or thinking about being pregnant or something of that sort. So  it works very well there  but it doesn't work very well when you need more quantitative information. There are also dipsticks  but if you look at the dipsticks  they're for another kind of urine analysis. There are an awful lot of colors and things like that. What do you actually do about that in a difficult circumstance  So  the approach that we started with is to ask  Is it really practical to make things of this sort  And that problem is now  in a purely engineering way  solved. And the procedure that we have is simply to start with paper. You run it through a new kind of printer called a wax printer. The wax printer does what looks like printing. It is printing. You put that on  you warm it a little bit  the wax prints through so it absorbs into the paper  and you end up with the device that you want. The printers cost     bucks now. They'll make  we estimate that if you were to run them    hours a day they'd make about    million tests a year. So  it's a solved problem  that particular problem is solved. And there is an example of the kind of thing that you see. That's on a piece of   by    paper. That takes about two seconds to make. And so I regard that as done. There is a very important issue here  which is that because it's a printer  a color printer  it prints colors. That's what color printers do. I'll show you in a moment  that's actually quite useful. Now  the next question that you would like to ask is  What would you like to measure  What would you like to analyze  And the thing which you'd most like to analyze  we're a fair distance from. It's what's called  fever of undiagnosed origin.  Someone comes into the clinic  they have a fever  they feel bad. What do they have  Do they have T.B.  Do they have AIDS  Do they have a common cold  The triage problem. That's a hard problem for reasons that I won't go through. There are an awful lot of things that you'd like to distinguish among. But then there are a series of things  AIDS  hepatitis  malaria  TB  others and simpler ones  such as guidance of treatment. Now even that's more complicated than you think. A friend of mine works in transcultural psychiatry  and he is interested in the question of why people do and don't take their meds. So  Dapsone  or something like that  you have to take it for a while. He has a wonderful story of talking to a villager in India and saying   Have you taken your Dapsone    Yes.   Have you taken it every day    Yes.   Have you taken if for a month    Yes.  What the guy actually meant was that he'd fed a    day dose of Dapsone to his dog  that morning. He was telling the truth. Because in a different culture  the dog is a surrogate for you  you know   today    this month    since the rainy season     there are lots of opportunities for misunderstanding  and so an issue here is to  in some cases  to figure out how to deal with matters that seem uninteresting  like compliance. Now  take a look at what a typical test looks like. Prick a finger  you get some blood  about    microliters. That's about all you're going to get  because you can't use the usual sort of systems. You can't manipulate it very well  although I'll show something about that in a moment. So  you take the drop of blood  no further manipulations  you put it on a little device  the device filters out the blood cells  lets the serum go through  and you get a series of colors down in the bottom there. And the colors indicate  disease  or  normal.  But even that's complicated  because to you  to me  colors might indicate  normal   but  after all  we're all suffering from probably an excess of education. What you do about something which requires quantitative analysis  And so the solution that we and many other people are thinking about there  and at this point there is a dramatic flourish  and out comes the universal solution to everything these days  which is a cell phone. In this particular case  a camera phone. They're everywhere  six billion a month in India. And the idea is that what one does  is to take the device  you dip it  you develop the color  you take a picture  the picture goes to a central laboratory. You don't have to send out a doctor  you send out somebody who can just take the sample  and in the clinic either a doctor  or ideally a computer in this case  does the analysis. Turns out to work actually quite well  particularly when your color printer has printed the color bars that indicate how things work. So  my view of the health care worker of the future is not a doctor  but is an    year old  otherwise unemployed  who has two things  He has a backpack full of these tests  and a lancet to occasionally take a blood sample  and an AK   . And these are the things that get him through his day. There's another very interesting connection here  and that is that what one wants to do is to pass through useful information over what is generally a pretty awful telephone system. It turns out there's an enormous amount of information already available on that subject  which is the Mars rover problem. How do you get back an accurate view of the color on Mars if you have a really terrible bandwidth to do it with  And the answer is not complicated but it's one which I don't want to go through here  other than to say that the communication systems for doing this are really pretty well understood. Also  a fact which you may not know is that the compute capability of this thing is not so different from the compute capability of your desktop computer. This is a fantastic device which is only beginning to be tapped. I don't know whether the idea of one computer  one child makes any sense. Here's the computer of the future  because this screen is already there and they're ubiquitous. All right now let me show you just a little bit about advanced devices. And we'll start by posing a little problem. What you see here is another centimeter sized device  and the different colors are different colors of dye. And you notice something which might strike you as a little bit interesting  which is the yellow seems to disappear  get through the blue  and then get through the red. How does that happen  How do you make something flow through something  And  of course the answer is   You don't.  You make it flow under and over. But now the question is  How do you make it flow under and over in a piece of paper  The answer is that what you do  and the details are not terribly important here  is to make something more elaborate  You take several different layers of paper  each one containing its own little fluid system  and you separate them by pieces of  literally  double sided carpet tape  the stuff you use to stick the carpets onto the floor. And the fluid will flow from one layer into the next. It distributes itself  flows through further holes  distributes itself. And what you see  at the lower right hand side there  is a sample in which a single sample of blood has been put on the top  and it has gone through and distributed itself into these    holes on the bottom  in a piece of paper    basically it looks like a chip  two pieces of paper thick. And in this particular case we were just interested in the replicability of that. But that is  in principle  the way you solve the  fever of unexplained origin  problem  because each one of those spots then becomes a test for a particular set of markers of disease  and this will work in due course. Here is an example of a slightly more complicated device. There's the chip. You dip in a corner. The fluid goes into the center. It distributes itself out into these various wells or holes  and turns color  and all done with paper and carpet tape. So  I think it's as low cost as we're likely to be able to come up and make things. Now  I have one last  two last little stories to tell you  in finishing off this business. This is one  One of the things that one does occasionally need to do is to separate blood cells from serum. And the question was  here we do it by taking a sample  we put it in a centrifuge  we spin it  and you get blood cells out. Terrific. What happens if you don't have an electricity  and a centrifuge  and whatever  And we thought for a while of how you might do this and the way  in fact  you do it is what's shown here. You get an eggbeater  which is everywhere  and you saw off a blade  and then you take tubing  and you stick it on that. You put the blood in  you spin it    somebody sits there and spins it. It works really  really well. And we sat down  we did the physics of eggbeaters and self aligning tubes and all the rest of that kind of thing  sent it off to a journal. We were very proud of this  particularly the title  which was  Eggbeater as Centrifuge.  And we sent it off  and by return mail it came back. I called up the editor and I said   What's going on  How is this possible   The editor said  with enormous disdain   I read this. And we're not going to publish it  because we only publish science.  And it's an important issue because it means that we have to  as a society  think about what we value. And if it's just papers and phys. rev. letters  we've got a problem. Here is another example of something which is    this is a little spectrophotometer. It measures the absorption of light in a sample The neat thing about this is  you have light source that flickers on and off at about       hertz  another light source that detects that light at       hertz  and so you can run this system in broad daylight. It performs about equivalently to a system that's in the order of         dollars. It costs    dollars. We can probably make it for    cents  if we put our mind to it. Why doesn't somebody do it  And the answer is   How do you make a profit in a capitalist system  doing that   Interesting problem. So  let me finish by saying that we've thought about this as a kind of engineering problem. And we've asked  What is the scientific unifying idea here  And we've decided that we should think about this not so much in terms of cost  but in terms of simplicity. Simplicity is a neat word. And you've got to think about what simplicity means. I know what it is but I don't actually know what it means. So  I actually was interested enough in this to put together several groups of people. And the most recent involved a couple of people at MIT  one of them being an exceptionally bright kid who is one of the very few people I would think of who's an authentic genius. We all struggled for an entire day to think about simplicity. And I want to give you the answer of this deep scientific thought. So  in a sense  you get what you pay for. Thank you very much. I'm a cancer doctor  and I walked out of my office and walked by the pharmacy in the hospital three or four years ago  and this was the cover of Fortune magazine sitting in the window of the pharmacy. And so  as a cancer doctor  you look at this  and you get a little bit downhearted. But when you start to read the article by Cliff  who himself is a cancer survivor  who was saved by a clinical trial where his parents drove him from New York City to upstate New York to get an experimental therapy for    at the time    Hodgkin's disease  which saved his life  he makes remarkable points here. And the point of the article was that we have gotten reductionist in our view of biology  in our view of cancer. For the last    years  we have focused on treating the individual gene in understanding cancer  not in controlling cancer. So  this is an astounding table. And this is something that sobers us in our field everyday in that  obviously  we've made remarkable impacts on cardiovascular disease  but look at cancer. The death rate in cancer in over    years hasn't changed. We've made small wins in diseases like chronic myelogenous leukemia  where we have a pill that can put     percent of people in remission  but in general  we haven't made an impact at all in the war on cancer. So  what I'm going to tell you today  is a little bit of why I think that's the case  and then go out of my comfort zone and tell you where I think it's going  where a new approach    that we hope to push forward in terms of treating cancer. Because this is wrong. So  what is cancer  first of all  Well  if one has a mass or an abnormal blood value  you go to a doctor  they stick a needle in. They way we make the diagnosis today is by pattern recognition  Does it look normal  Does it look abnormal  So  that pathologist is just like looking at this plastic bottle. This is a normal cell. This is a cancer cell. That is the state of the art today in diagnosing cancer. There's no molecular test  there's no sequencing of genes that was referred to yesterday  there's no fancy looking at the chromosomes. This is the state of the art and how we do it. You know  I know very well  as a cancer doctor  I can't treat advanced cancer. So  as an aside  I firmly believe in the field of trying to identify cancer early. It is the only way you can start to fight cancer  is by catching it early. We can prevent most cancers. You know  the previous talk alluded to preventing heart disease. We could do the same in cancer. I co founded a company called Navigenics  where  if you spit into a tube    and we can look look at    or    genetic markers for disease  all of which are delayable in many of the cancers    you start to identify what you could get  and then we can start to work to prevent them. Because the problem is  when you have advanced cancer  we can't do that much today about it  as the statistics allude to. So  the thing about cancer is that it's a disease of the aged. Why is it a disease of the aged  Because evolution doesn't care about us after we've had our children. See  evolution protected us during our childbearing years and then  after age    or    or     it said  It doesn't matter anymore  because they've had their progeny.  So if you look at cancers  it is very rare    extremely rare    to have cancer in a child  on the order of thousands of cases a year. As one gets older  Very  very common. Why is it hard to treat  Because it's heterogeneous  and that's the perfect substrate for evolution within the cancer. It starts to select out for those bad  aggressive cells  what we call clonal selection. But  if we start to understand that cancer isn't just a molecular defect  it's something more  then we'll get to new ways of treating it  as I'll show you. So  one of the fundamental problems we have in cancer is that  right now  we describe it by a number of adjectives  symptoms   I'm tired  I'm bloated  I have pain  etc.  You then have some anatomic descriptions  you get that CT scan   There's a three centimeter mass in the liver.  You then have some body part descriptions   It's in the liver  in the breast  in the prostate.  And that's about it. So  our dictionary for describing cancer is very  very poor. It's basically symptoms. It's manifestations of a disease. What's exciting is that over the last two or three years  the government has spent     million dollars  and they've allocated another billion dollars  to what we call the Cancer Genome Atlas Project. So  it is the idea of sequencing all of the genes in the cancer  and giving us a new lexicon  a new dictionary to describe it. You know  in the mid     's in France  they started to describe cancer by body part. That hasn't changed in over     years. It is absolutely archaic that we call cancer by prostate  by breast  by muscle. It makes no sense  if you think about it. So  obviously  the technology is here today  and  over the next several years  that will change. You will no longer go to a breast cancer clinic. You will go to a HER  amplified clinic  or an EGFR activated clinic  and they will go to some of the pathogenic lesions that were involved in causing this individual cancer. So  hopefully  we will go from being the art of medicine more to the science of medicine  and be able to do what they do in infectious disease  which is look at that organism  that bacteria  and then say   This antibiotic makes sense  because you have a particular bacteria that will respond to it.  When one is exposed to H N   you take Tamiflu  and you can remarkably decrease the severity of symptoms and prevent many of the manifestations of the disease. Why  Because we know what you have  and we know how to treat it    although we can't make vaccine in this country  but that's a different story. The Cancer Genome Atlas is coming out now. The first cancer was done  which was brain cancer. In the next month  the end of December  you'll see ovarian cancer  and then lung cancer will come several months after. There's also a field of proteomics that I'll talk about in a few minutes  which I think is going to be the next level in terms of understanding and classifying disease. But remember  I'm not pushing genomics  proteomics  to be a reductionist. I'm doing it so we can identify what we're up against. And there's a very important distinction there that we'll get to. In health care today  we spend most of the dollars    in terms of treating disease    most of the dollars in the last two years of a person's life. We spend very little  if any  dollars in terms of identifying what we're up against. If you could start to move that  to identify what you're up against  you're going to do things a hell of a lot better. If we could even take it one step further and prevent disease  we can take it enormously the other direction  and obviously  that's where we need to go  going forward. So  this is the website of the National Cancer Institute. And I'm here to tell you  it's wrong. So  the website of the National Cancer Institute says that cancer is a genetic disease. The website says   If you look  there's an individual mutation  and maybe a second  and maybe a third  and that is cancer.  But  as a cancer doc  this is what I see. This isn't a genetic disease. So  there you see  it's a liver with colon cancer in it  and you see into the microscope a lymph node where cancer has invaded. You see a CT scan where cancer is in the liver. Cancer is an interaction of a cell that no longer is under growth control with the environment. It's not in the abstract  it's the interaction with the environment. It's what we call a system. The goal of me as a cancer doctor is not to understand cancer. And I think that's been the fundamental problem over the last five decades  is that we have strived to understand cancer. The goal is to control cancer. And that is a very different optimization scheme  a very different strategy for all of us. I got up at the American Association of Cancer Research  one of the big cancer research meetings  with        people there  and I said   We've made a mistake. We've all made a mistake  myself included  by focusing down  by being a reductionist. We need to take a step back.  And  believe it or not  there were hisses in the audience. People got upset  but this is the only way we're going to go forward. You know  I was very fortunate to meet Danny Hillis a few years ago. We were pushed together  and neither one of us really wanted to meet the other. I said   Do I really want to meet a guy from Disney  who designed computers   And he was saying  Does he really want to meet another doctor  But people prevailed on us  and we got together  and it's been transformative in what I do  absolutely transformative. We have designed  and we have worked on the modeling    and much of these ideas came from Danny and from his team    the modeling of cancer in the body as complex system. And I'll show you some data there where I really think it can make a difference and a new way to approach it. The key is  when you look at these variables and you look at this data  you have to understand the data inputs. You know  if I measured your temperature over    days  and I asked   What was the average temperature   and it came back at   .   I would say   Great.  But if during one of those days your temperature spiked to     for six hours  and you took Tylenol and got better  etc.  I would totally miss it. So  one of the problems  the fundamental problems in medicine is that you and I  and all of us  we go to our doctor once a year. We have discrete data elements  we don't have a time function on them. Earlier it was referred to this direct life device. You know  I've been using it for two and a half months. It's a staggering device  not because it tells me how many kilocalories I do every day  but because it looks  over    hours  what I've done in a day. And I didn't realize that for three hours I'm sitting at my desk  and I'm not moving at all. And a lot of the functions in the data that we have as input systems here are really different than we understand them  because we're not measuring them dynamically. And so  if you think of cancer as a system  there's an input and an output and a state in the middle. So  the states  are equivalent classes of history  and the cancer patient  the input  is the environment  the diet  the treatment  the genetic mutations. The output are our symptoms  Do we have pain  Is the cancer growing  Do we feel bloated  etc.  Most of that state is hidden. So what we do in our field is we change and input  we give aggressive chemotherapy  and we say   Did that output get better  Did that pain improve  etc.   And so  the problem is that it's not just one system  it's multiple systems on multiple scales. It's a system of systems. And so  when you start to look at emergent systems  you can look at a neuron under a microscope. A neuron under the microscope is very elegant with little things sticking out and little things over here  but when you start to put them together in a complex system  and you start to see that it becomes a brain  and that brain can create intelligence  what we're talking about in the body  and cancer is starting to model it like a complex system. Well  the bad news is that these robust    and robust is a key word    emergent systems are very hard to understand in detail. The good news is you can manipulate them. You can try to control them without that fundamental understanding of every component. One of the most fundamental clinical trials in cancer came out in February in the New England Journal of Medicine  where they took women who were pre menopausal with breast cancer. So  about the worst kind of breast cancer you can get. They had gotten their chemotherapy  and then they randomized them  where half got placebo  and half got a drug called Zoledronic acid that builds bone. It's used to treat osteoporosis  and they got that twice a year. They looked and  in these       women  given twice a year a drug that builds bone  you reduce the recurrence of cancer by    percent. Reduce occurrence of cancer by a drug that doesn't even touch the cancer. So the notion  you change the soil  the seed doesn't grow as well. You change that system  and you could have a marked effect on the cancer. Nobody has ever shown    and this will be shocking    nobody has ever shown that most chemotherapy actually touches a cancer cell. It's never been shown. There's all these elegant work in the tissue culture dishes  that if you give this cancer drug  you can do this effect to the cell  but the doses in those dishes are nowhere near the doses that happen in the body. If I give a woman with breast cancer a drug called Taxol every three weeks  which is the standard  about    percent of women with metastatic cancer have a great response to that drug. And a response is    percent shrinkage. Well  remember that's not even an order of magnitude  but that's a different story. They then recur  I give them that same drug every week. Another    percent will respond. They then recur  I give them that same drug over    hours by continuous infusion  another    or    percent will respond. So  you can't tell me it's working by the same mechanism in all three size. It's not. We have no idea the mechanism. So the idea that chemotherapy may just be disrupting that complex system  just like building bone disrupted that system and reduced recurrence  chemotherapy may work by that same exact way. The wild thing about that trial also  was that it reduced new primaries  so new cancers  by    percent also. So  the problem is  yours and mine  all of our systems are changing. They're dynamic. I mean  this is a scary slide  not to take an aside  but it looks at obesity in the world. And I'm sorry if you can't read the numbers  they're kind of small. But  if you start to look at it  that red  that dark color there  more than    percent of the population of those countries are obese. Look a decade ago  look two decades ago  markedly different. So  our systems today are dramatically different than our systems a decade or two ago. So the diseases we have today  which reflect patterns in the system over the last several decades  are going to change dramatically over the next decade or so based on things like this. So  this picture  although it is beautiful  is a    gigabyte picture of the whole proteome. So this is a drop of blood that has gone through a superconducting magnet  and we're able to get resolution where we can start to see all of the proteins in the body. We can start to see that system. Each of the red dots are where a protein has actually been identified. The power of these magnets  the power of what we can do here  is that we can see an individual neutron with this technology. So  again  this is stuff we're doing with Danny Hillis and a group called Applied Proteomics  where we can start to see individual neutron differences  and we can start to look at that system like we never have before. So  instead of a reductionist view  we're taking a step back. So this is a woman     years old  who had recurrent lung cancer. It was in her brain  in her lungs  in her liver. She had gotten Carboplatin Taxol  Carboplatin Taxotere  Gemcitabine  Navelbine  Every drug we have she had gotten  and that disease continued to grow. She had three kids under the age of     and this is her CT scan. And so what this is  is we're taking a cross section of her body here  and you can see in the middle there is her heart  and to the side of her heart on the left there is this large tumor that will invade and will kill her  untreated  in a matter of weeks. She goes on a pill a day that targets a pathway  and again  I'm not sure if this pathway was in the system  in the cancer  but it targeted a pathway  and a month later  pow  that cancer's gone. Six months later it's still gone. That cancer recurred  and she passed away three years later from lung cancer  but she got three years from a drug whose symptoms predominately were acne. That's about it. So  the problem is that the clinical trial was done  and we were a part of it  and in the fundamental clinical trial    the pivotal clinical trial we call the Phase Three  we refused to use a placebo. Would you want your mother  your brother  your sister to get a placebo if they had advanced lung cancer and had weeks to live  And the answer  obviously  is not. So  it was done on this group of patients. Ten percent of people in the trial had this dramatic response that was shown here  and the drug went to the FDA  and the FDA said   Without a placebo  how do I know patients actually benefited from the drug   So the morning the FDA was going to meet  this was the editorial in the Wall Street Journal. And so  what do you know  that drug was approved. The amazing thing is another company did the right scientific trial  where they gave half placebo and half the drug. And we learned something important there. What's interesting is they did it in South America and Canada  where it's  more ethical to give placebos.  They had to give it also in the U.S. to get approval  so I think there were three U.S. patients in upstate New York who were part of the trial. But they did that  and what they found is that    percent of the non responders lived much longer and did better than people who got placebo. So it challenged everything we knew in cancer  is that you don't need to get a response. You don't need to shrink the disease. If we slow the disease  we may have more of a benefit on patient survival  patient outcome  how they feel  than if we shrink the disease. The problem is that  if I'm this doc  and I get your CT scan today and you've got a two centimeter mass in your liver  and you come back to me in three months and it's three centimeters  did that drug help you or not  How do I know  Would it have been    centimeters  or am I giving you a drug with no benefit and significant cost  So  it's a fundamental problem. And  again  that's where these new technologies can come in. And so  the goal obviously is that you go into your doctor's office    well  the ultimate goal is that you prevent disease  right  The ultimate goal is that you prevent any of these things from happening. That is the most effective  cost effective  best way we can do things today. But if one is unfortunate to get a disease  you'll go into your doctor's office  he or she will take a drop of blood  and we will start to know how to treat your disease. The way we've approached it is the field of proteomics  again  this looking at the system. It's taking a big picture. The problem with technologies like this is that if one looks at proteins in the body  there are    orders of magnitude difference between the high abundant and the low abundant proteins. So  there's no technology in the world that can span    orders of magnitude. And so  a lot of what has been done with people like Danny Hillis and others is to try to bring in engineering principles  try to bring the software. We can start to look at different components along this spectrum. And so  earlier was talked about cross discipline  about collaboration. And I think one of the exciting things that is starting to happen now is that people from those fields are coming in. Yesterday  the National Cancer Institute announced a new program called the Physical Sciences and Oncology  where physicists  mathematicians  are brought in to think about cancer  people who never approached it before. Danny and I got    million dollars  they announced yesterday  to try to attach this problem. A whole new approach  instead of giving high doses of chemotherapy by different mechanisms  to try to bring technology to get a picture of what's actually happening in the body. So  just for two seconds  how these technologies work    because I think it's important to understand it. What happens is every protein in your body is charged  so the proteins are sprayed in  the magnet spins them around  and then there's a detector at the end. When it hit that detector is dependent on the mass and the charge. And so we can accurately    if the magnet is big enough  and your resolution is high enough    you can actually detect all of the proteins in the body and start to get an understanding of the individual system. And so  as a cancer doctor  instead of having paper in my chart  in your chart  and it being this thick  this is what data flow is starting to look like in our offices  where that drop of blood is creating gigabytes of data. Electronic data elements are describing every aspect of the disease. And certainly the goal is we can start to learn from every encounter and actually move forward  instead of just having encounter and encounter  without fundamental learning. So  to conclude  we need to get away from reductionist thinking. We need to start to think differently and radically. And so  I implore everyone here  Think differently. Come up with new ideas. Tell them to me or anyone else in our field  because over the last    years  nothing has changed. We need a radically different approach. You know  Andy Grove stepped down as chairman of the board at Intel    and Andy was one of my mentors  tough individual. When Andy stepped down  he said   No technology will win. Technology itself will win.  And I'm a firm believer  in the field of medicine and especially cancer  that it's going to be a broad platform of technologies that will help us move forward and hopefully help patients in the near term. Thank you very much. John Hockenberry  It's great to be here with you  Tom. And I want to start with a question that has just been consuming me since I first became familiar with your work. In you work there's always this kind of hybrid quality of a natural force in some sort of interplay with creative force. Are they ever in equilibrium in the way that you see your work  Tom Shannon  Yeah  the subject matter that I'm looking for  it's usually to solve a question. I had the question popped into my head  What does the cone that connects the sun and the Earth look like if you could connect the two spheres  And in proportion  what would the size of the sphere and the length  and what would the taper be to the Earth  And so I went about and made that sculpture  turning it out of solid bronze. And I did one that was about    feet long. The sun end was about four inches in diameter  and then it tapered over about    feet to about a millimeter at the Earth end. And so for me  it was really exciting just to see what it looks like if you could step outside and into a larger context  as though you were an astronaut  and see these two things as an object  because they are so intimately bound  and one is meaningless without the other. JH  Is there a relief in playing with these forces  And I'm wondering how much of a sense of discovery there is in playing with these forces. TS  Well  like the magnetically levitated objects    like that silver one there  that was the result of hundreds of experiments with magnets  trying to find a way to make something float with the least possible connection to the ground. So I got it down to just one tether to be able to support that. JH  Now is this electromagnetic here  or are these static  TS  Those are permanent magnets  yeah. JH  Because if the power went out  there would just be a big noise. TS  Yeah. It's really unsatisfactory having plug in art. JH  I agree. TS  The magnetic works are a combination of gravity and magnetism  so it's a kind of mixture of these ambient forces that influence everything. The sun has a tremendous field that extends way beyond the planets and the Earth's magnetic field protects us from the sun. So there's this huge invisible shape structures that magnetism takes in the universe. But with the pendulum  it allows me to manifest these invisible forces that are holding the magnets up. My sculptures are normally very simplified. I try to refine them down to very simple forms. But the paintings become very complex  because I think the fields that are supporting them  they're billowing  and they're interpenetrating  and they're interference patterns. JH  And they're non deterministic. I mean  you don't know necessarily where you're headed when you begin  even though the forces can be calculated. So the evolution of this    I gather this isn't your first pendulum. TS  No.  JH  No.  TS  The first one I did was in the late   's  and I just had a simple cone with a spigot at the bottom of it. I threw it into an orbit  and it only had one color  and when it got to the center  the paint kept running out  so I had to run in there  didn't have any control over the spigot remotely. So that told me right away  I need a remote control device. But then I started dreaming of having six colors. I sort of think about it as the DNA    these colors  the red  blue  yellow  the primary colors and white and black. And if you put them together in different combinations    just like printing in a sense  like how a magazine color is printed    and put them under certain forces  which is orbiting them or passing them back and forth or drawing with them  these amazing things started appearing. JH  It looks like we're loaded for bear here. TS  Yeah  well let's put a couple of canvases. I'll ask a couple of my sons to set up the canvases here. I want to just say    so this is Jack  Nick and Louie. JH  Thanks guys. TS  So here are the    JH  All right  I'll get out of the way here. TS  I'm just going to throw this into an orbit and see if I can paint everybody's shoes in the front. JH  Whoa. That is ... ooh  nice. TS  So something like this. I'm doing this as a demo  and it's more playful  but inevitably  all of this can be used. I can redeem this painting  just continuing on  doing layers upon layers. And I keep it around for a couple of weeks  and I'm contemplating it  and I'll do another session with it and bring it up to another level  where all of this becomes the background  the depth of it. JH  That's fantastic. So the valves at the bottom of those tubes there are like radio controlled airplane valves. TS  Yes  they're servos with cams that pinch these rubber tubes. And they can pinch them very tight and stop it  or you can have them wide open. And all of the colors come out one central port at the bottom. You can always be changing colors  put aluminum paint  or I could put anything into this. It could be tomato sauce  or anything could be dispensed    sand  powders or anything like that. JH  So many forces there. You've got gravity  you've got the centrifugal force  you've got the fluid dynamics. Each of these beautiful paintings  are they images in and of themselves  or are they records of a physical event called the pendulum approaching the canvas  TS  Well  this painting here  I wanted to do something very simple  a simple  iconic image of two ripples interfering. So the one on the right was done first  and then the one on the left was done over it. And then I left gaps so you could see the one that was done before. And then when I did the second one  it really disturbed the piece    these big blue lines crashing through the center of it    and so it created a kind of tension and an overlap. There are lines in front of the one on the right  and there are lines behind the one on the left  and so it takes it into different planes. What it's also about  just the little events  the events of the interpenetration of    JH  Two stars  or    TS  Two things that happened    there's an interference pattern  and then a third thing happens. There are shapes that come about just by the marriage of two events that are happening  and I'm very interested in that. Like the occurrence of moire patterns. Like this green one  this is a painting I did about    years ago  but it has some    see  in the upper third    there are these moires and interference patterns that are radio kind of imagery. And that's something that in painting I've never seen done. I've never seen a representation of a kind of radio interference patterns  which are so ubiquitous and such an important part of our lives. JH  Is that a literal part of the image  or is my eye making that interference pattern    is my eye completing that interference pattern  TS  It is the paint actually  makes it real. It's really manifested there. If I throw a very concentric circle  or concentric ellipse  it just dutifully makes these evenly spaced lines  which get closer and closer together  which describes how gravity works. There's something very appealing about the exactitude of science that I really enjoy. And I love the shapes that I see in scientific observations and apparatus  especially astronomical forms and the idea of the vastness of it  the scale  is very interesting to me. My focus in recent years has kind of shifted more toward biology. Some of these paintings  when you look at them very close  odd things appear that really look like horses or birds or crocodiles  elephants. There are lots of things that appear. When you look into it  it's sort of like looking at cloud patterns  but sometimes they're very modeled and highly rendered. And then there are all these forms that we don't know what they are  but they're equally well resolved and complex. So I think  conceivably  those could be predictive. Because since it has the ability to make forms that look like forms that we're familiar with in biology  it's also making other forms that we're not familiar with. And maybe it's the kind of forms we'll discover underneath the surface of Mars  where there are probably lakes with fish swimming under the surface. JH  Oh  let's hope so. Oh  my God  let's. Oh  please  yes. Oh  I'm so there. You know  it seems at this stage in your life  you also very personally are in this state of confrontation with a sort of dissonant    I suppose it's an electromagnetic force that somehow governs your Parkinson's and this creative force that is both the artist who is in the here and now and this sort of arc of your whole life. Is that relevant to your work  TS  As it turns out  this device kind of comes in handy  because I don't have to have the fine motor skills to do  that I can operate slides  which is more of a mental process. I'm looking at it and making decisions  It needs more red  it needs more blue  it needs a different shape. And so I make these creative decisions and can execute them in a much  much simpler way. I mean  I've got the symptoms. I guess Parkinson's kind of creeps up over the years  but at a certain point you start seeing the symptoms. In my case  my left hand has a significant tremor and my left leg also. I'm left handed  and so I draw. All my creations really start on small drawings  which I have thousands of  and it's my way of just thinking. I draw with a simple pencil  and at first  the Parkinson's was really upsetting  because I couldn't get the pencil to stand still. JH  So you're not a gatekeeper for these forces. You don't think of yourself as the master of these forces. You think of yourself as the servant. TS  Nature is    well  it's a godsend. It just has so much in it. And I think nature wants to express itself in the sense that we are nature  humans are of the universe. The universe is in our mind  and our minds are in the universe. And we are expressions of the universe  basically. As humans  ultimately being part of the universe  we're kind of the spokespeople or the observer part of the constituency of the universe. And to interface with it  with a device that lets these forces that are everywhere act and show what they can do  giving them pigment and paint just like an artist  it's a good ally. It's a terrific studio assistant. JH  Well  I love the idea that somewhere within this idea of fine motion and control with the traditional skills that you have with your hand  some sort of more elemental force gets revealed  and that's the beauty here. Tom  thank you so much. It's been really  really great. TS  Thank you  John. I am going to speak about corruption  but I would like to juxtapose two different things. One is the large global economy  the large globalized economy  and the other one is the small  and very limited  capacity of our traditional governments and their international institutions to govern  to shape  this economy. Because there is this asymmetry  which creates  basically  failing governance. Failing governance in many areas  in the area of corruption and the area of destruction of the environment  in the area of exploitation of women and children  in the area of climate change  in all the areas in which we really need a capacity to reintroduce the primacy of politics into the economy  which is operating in a worldwide arena. And I think corruption  and the fight against corruption  and the impact of corruption  is probably one of the most interesting ways to illustrate what I mean with this failure of governance. Let me talk about my own experience. I used to work as the director of the World Bank office in Nairobi for East Africa. At that time  I noticed that corruption  that grand corruption  that systematic corruption  was undermining everything we were trying to do. And therefore  I began to not only try to protect the work of the World Bank  our own projects  our own programs against corruption  but in general  I thought   We need a system to protect the people in this part of the world from the ravages of corruption.  And as soon as I started this work  I received a memorandum from the World Bank  from the legal department first  in which they said   You are not allowed to do this. You are meddling in the internal affairs of our partner countries. This is forbidden by the charter of the World Bank  so I want you to stop your doings.  In the meantime  I was chairing donor meetings  for instance  in which the various donors  and many of them like to be in Nairobi    it is true  it is one of the unsafest cities of the world  but they like to be there because the other cities are even less comfortable. And in these donor meetings  I noticed that many of the worst projects    which were put forward by our clients  by the governments  by promoters  many of them representing suppliers from the North    that the worst projects were realized first. Let me give you an example  a huge power project      million dollars  to be built smack into one of the most vulnerable  and one of the most beautiful  areas of western Kenya. And we all noticed immediately that this project had no economic benefits  It had no clients  nobody would buy the electricity there  nobody was interested in irrigation projects. To the contrary  we knew that this project would destroy the environment  It would destroy riparian forests  which were the basis for the survival of nomadic groups  the Samburu and the Turkana in this area. So everybody knew this is a  not a useless project  this is an absolute damaging  a terrible project    not to speak about the future indebtedness of the country for these hundreds of millions of dollars  and the siphoning off of the scarce resources of the economy from much more important activities like schools  like hospitals and so on. And yet  we all rejected this project  none of the donors was willing to have their name connected with it  and it was the first project to be implemented. The good projects  which we as a donor community would take under our wings  they took years  you know  you had too many studies  and very often they didn't succeed. But these bad projects  which were absolutely damaging    for the economy for many generations  for the environment  for thousands of families who had to be resettled    they were suddenly put together by consortia of banks  of supplier agencies  of insurance agencies    like in Germany  Hermes  and so on    and they came back very  very quickly  driven by an unholy alliance between the powerful elites in the countries there and the suppliers from the North. Now  these suppliers were our big companies. They were the actors of this global market  which I mentioned in the beginning. They were the Siemenses of this world  coming from France  from the UK  from Japan  from Canada  from Germany  and they were systematically driven by systematic  large scale corruption. We are not talking about        dollars here  or         dollars there  or one million dollars there. No  we are talking about    million     million dollars on the Swiss bank accounts  on the bank accounts of Liechtenstein  of the president's ministers  the high officials in the para statal sectors. This was the reality which I saw  and not only one project like that  I saw  I would say  over the years I worked in Africa  I saw hundreds of projects like this. And so  I became convinced that it is this systematic corruption which is perverting economic policy making in these countries  which is the main reason for the misery  for the poverty  for the conflicts  for the violence  for the desperation in many of these countries. That we have today more than a billion people below the absolute poverty line  that we have more than a billion people without proper drinking water in the world  twice that number  more than two billion people without sanitation and so on  and the consequent illnesses of mothers and children  still  child mortality of more than    million people every year  children dying before they are five years old  The cause of this is  to a large extent  grand corruption. Now  why did the World Bank not let me do this work  I found out afterwards  after I left  under a big fight  the World Bank. The reason was that the members of the World Bank thought that foreign bribery was okay  including Germany. In Germany  foreign bribery was allowed. It was even tax deductible. No wonder that most of the most important international operators in Germany  but also in France and the UK and Scandinavia  everywhere  systematically bribed. Not all of them  but most of them. And this is the phenomenon which I call failing governance  because when I then came to Germany and started this little NGO here in Berlin  at the Villa Borsig  we were told   You cannot stop our German exporters from bribing  because we will lose our contracts. We will lose to the French  we will lose to the Swedes  we'll lose to the Japanese.  And therefore  there was a indeed a prisoner's dilemma  which made it very difficult for an individual company  an individual exporting country to say   We are not going to continue this deadly  disastrous habit of large companies to bribe.  So this is what I mean with a failing governance structure  because even the powerful government  which we have in Germany  comparatively  was not able to say   We will not allow our companies to bribe abroad.  They needed help  and the large companies themselves have this dilemma. Many of them didn't want to bribe. Many of the German companies  for instance  believe that they are really producing a high quality product at a good price  so they are very competitive. They are not as good at bribing as many of their international competitors are  but they were not allowed to show their strengths  because the world was eaten up by grand corruption. And this is why I'm telling you this  Civil society rose to the occasion. We had this small NGO  Transparency International. They began to think of an escape route from this prisoner's dilemma  and we developed concepts of collective action  basically trying to bring various competitors together around the table  explaining to all of them how much it would be in their interests if they simultaneously would stop bribing  and to make a long story short  we managed to eventually get Germany to sign together with the other OECD countries and a few other exporters. In       a convention  under the auspices of the OECD  which obliged everybody to change their laws and criminalize foreign bribery. Well  thank you. I mean  it's interesting  in doing this  we had to sit together with the companies. We had here in Berlin  at the Aspen Institute on the Wannsee  we had sessions with about    captains of industry  and we discussed with them what to do about international bribery. In the first session    we had three sessions over the course of two years. And President von Weizs cker  by the way  chaired one of the sessions  the first one  to take the fear away from the entrepreneurs  who were not used to deal with non governmental organizations. And in the first session  they all said   This is not bribery  what we are doing.  This is customary there. This is what these other cultures demand. They even applaud it. In fact   unclear  still says this today. And so there are still a lot of people who are not convinced that you have to stop bribing. But in the second session  they admitted already that they would never do this  what they are doing in these other countries  here in Germany  or in the U.K.  and so on. Cabinet ministers would admit this. And in the final session  at the Aspen Institute  we had them all sign an open letter to the Kohl government  at the time  requesting that they participate in the OECD convention. And this is  in my opinion  an example of soft power  because we were able to convince them that they had to go with us. We had a longer term time perspective. We had a broader  geographically much wider  constituency we were trying to defend. And that's why the law has changed. That's why Siemens is now in the trouble they are in and that's why MIN is in the trouble they are in. In some other countries  the OECD convention is not yet properly enforced. And  again  civil societies breathing down the neck of the establishment. In London  for instance  where the BAE got away with a huge corruption case  which the Serious Fraud Office tried to prosecute      million British pounds  every year for ten years  to one particular official of one particular friendly country  who then bought for    billion pounds of military equipment. This case  they are not prosecuting in the UK. Why  Because they consider this as contrary to the security interest of the people of Great Britain. Civil society is pushing  civil society is trying to get a solution to this problem  also in the U.K.  and also in Japan  which is not properly enforcing  and so on. In Germany  we are pushing the ratification of the UN convention  which is a subsequent convention. We are  Germany  is not ratifying. Why  Because it would make it necessary to criminalize the corruption of deputies. In Germany  we have a system where you are not allowed to bribe a civil servant  but you are allowed to bribe a deputy. This is  under German law  allowed  and the members of our parliament don't want to change this  and this is why they can't sign the U.N. convention against foreign bribery    one of they very  very few countries which is preaching honesty and good governance everywhere in the world  but not able to ratify the convention  which we managed to get on the books with about     countries all over the world. I see my time is ticking. Let me just try to draw some conclusions from what has happened. I believe that what we managed to achieve in fighting corruption  one can also achieve in other areas of failing governance. By now  the United Nations is totally on our side. The World Bank has turned from Saulus to Paulus  under Wolfensohn  they became  I would say  the strongest anti corruption agency in the world. Most of the large companies are now totally convinced that they have to put in place very strong policies against bribery and so on. And this is possible because civil society joined the companies and joined the government in the analysis of the problem  in the development of remedies  in the implementation of reforms  and then later  in the monitoring of reforms. Of course  if civil society organizations want to play that role  they have to grow into this responsibility. Not all civil society organizations are good. The Ku Klux Klan is an NGO. So  we must be aware that civil society has to shape up itself. They have to have a much more transparent financial governance. They have to have a much more participatory governance in many civil society organizations. We also need much more competence of civil society leaders. This is why we have set up the governance school and the Center for Civil Society here in Berlin  because we believe most of our educational and research institutions in Germany and continental Europe in general  do not focus enough  yet  on empowering civil society and training the leadership of civil society. But what I'm saying from my very practical experience  If civil society does it right and joins the other actors    in particular  governments  governments and their international institutions  but also large international actors  in particular those which have committed themselves to corporate social responsibility    then in this magical triangle between civil society  government and private sector  there is a tremendous chance for all of us to create a better world. Thank you. Sadly  in the next    minutes when I do our chat  four Americans that are alive will be dead through the food that they eat. My name's Jamie Oliver. I'm    years old. I'm from Essex in England and for the last seven years I've worked fairly tirelessly to save lives in my own way. I'm not a doctor  I'm a chef  I don't have expensive equipment or medicine. I use information  education. I profoundly believe that the power of food has a primal place in our homes that binds us to the best bits of life. We have an awful  awful reality right now. America  you're at the top of your game. This is one of the most unhealthy countries in the world. Can I please just see a raise of hands for how many of you have children in this room today  Put your hands up. You can continue to put your hands up  aunties and uncles as well. Most of you. OK. We  the adults of the last four generations  have blessed our children with the destiny of a shorter lifespan than their own parents. Your child will live a life ten years younger than you because of the landscape of food that we've built around them. Two thirds of this room  today  in America  are statistically overweight or obese. You lot  you're all right  but we'll get you eventually  don't worry. The statistics of bad health are clear  very clear. We spend our lives being paranoid about death  murder  homicide  you name it  it's on the front page of every paper  CNN. Look at homicide at the bottom  for God's sake. Right  Every single one of those in the red is a diet related disease. Any doctor  any specialist will tell you that. Fact  diet related disease is the biggest killer in the United States  right now  here today. This is a global problem. It's a catastrophe. It's sweeping the world. England is right behind you  as usual. I know they were close  but not that close. We need a revolution. Mexico  Australia  Germany  India  China  all have massive problems of obesity and bad health. Think about smoking. It costs way less than obesity now. Obesity costs you Americans    percent of your health care bills      billion dollars a year. In    years  it's set to double      billion dollars a year. Let's be honest  guys  you haven't got that cash. I came here to start a food revolution that I so profoundly believe in. We need it. The time is now. We're in a tipping point moment. I've been doing this for seven years. I've been trying in America for seven years. Now is the time when it's ripe    ripe for the picking. I went to the eye of the storm. I went to West Virginia  the most unhealthy state in America. Or it was last year. We've got a new one this year  but we'll work on that next season. Huntington  West Virginia. Beautiful town. I wanted to put heart and soul and people  your public  around the statistics that we've become so used to. I want to introduce you to some of the people that I care about  your public  your children. I want to show a picture of my friend Brittany. She's    years old. She's got six years to live because of the food that she's eaten. She's the third generation of Americans that hasn't grown up within a food environment where they've been taught to cook at home or in school  or her mom  or her mom's mom. She has six years to live. She's eating her liver to death. Stacy  the Edwards family. This is a normal family  guys. Stacy does her best  but she's third generation as well  she was never taught to cook at home or at school. The family's obese. Justin here     years old  he's     pounds. He gets bullied  for God's sake. The daughter there  Katie  she's four years old. She's obese before she even gets to primary school. Marissa  she's all right  she's one of your lot. But you know what  Her father  who was obese  died in her arms  And then the second most important man in her life  her uncle  died of obesity  and now her step dad is obese. You see  the thing is  obesity and diet related disease doesn't just hurt the people that have it  it's all of their friends  families  brothers  sisters. Pastor Steve  an inspirational man  one of my early allies in Huntington  West Virginia. He's at the sharp knife edge of this problem. He has to bury the people  OK  And he's fed up with it. He's fed up with burying his friends  his family  his community. Come winter  three times as many people die. He's sick of it. This is preventable disease. Waste of life. By the way  this is what they get buried in. We're not geared up to do this. Can't even get them out the door  and I'm being serious. Can't even get them there. Forklift. OK  I see it as a triangle  OK  This is our landscape of food. I need you to understand it. You've probably heard all this before. Over the last    years  what's happened that's ripped the heart out of this country  Let's be frank and honest. Well  modern day life. Let's start with the Main Street. Fast food has taken over the whole country  we know that. The big brands are some of the most important powers  powerful powers  in this country. Supermarkets as well. Big companies. Big companies. Thirty years ago  most of the food was largely local and largely fresh. Now it's largely processed and full of all sorts of additives  extra ingredients  and you know the rest of the story. Portion size is obviously a massive  massive problem. Labeling is a massive problem. The labeling in this country is a disgrace. The industry wants to self police themselves. What  in this kind of climate  They don't deserve it. How can you say something is low fat when it's full of so much sugar  Home. The biggest problem with the home is that used to be the heart of passing on food culture  what made our society. That is not happening anymore. And you know  as we go to work and as life changes  and as life always evolves  we kind of have to look at it holistically    step back for a moment  and re address the balance. It hasn't happened for    years  OK  I want to show you a situation that is very normal right now  the Edwards family. This stuff goes through you and your family's body every week. And I need you to know that this is going to kill your children early. How are you feeling  Stacy  Just feeling really sad and depressed right now. But  you know  I want my kids to succeed in life and this isn't going to get them there. But I'm killing them. JO  Yes you are. You are. But we can stop that. Normal. Let's get on schools  something that I'm fairly much a specialist in. OK  school. What is school  Who invented it  What's the purpose of school  School was always invented to arm us with the tools to make us creative  do wonderful things  make us earn a living  etc.  etc. You know  it's been kind of in this sort of tight box for a long  long time  OK  But we haven't really evolved it to deal with the health catastrophes of America  OK  School food is something that most kids       million a day  actually    have twice a day  more than often  breakfast and lunch      days of the year. So you could say that school food is quite important  really  judging the circumstances. Before I crack into my rant  which I'm sure you're waiting for    I need to say one thing  and it's so important in  hopefully  the magic that happens and unfolds in the next three months. The lunch ladies  the lunch cooks of America    I offer myself as their ambassador. I'm not slagging them off. They're doing the best they can do. They're doing their best. But they're doing what they're told  and what they're being told to do is wrong. The system is highly run by accountants  there's not enough  or any  food knowledgeable people in the business. There's a problem  If you're not a food expert  and you've got tight budgets and it's getting tighter  then you can't be creative  you can't duck and dive and write different things around things. If you're an accountant  and a box ticker  the only thing you can do in these circumstances is buy cheaper shit. Now  the reality is  the food that your kids get every day is fast food  it's highly processed  there's not enough fresh food in there at all. You know  the amount of additives  E numbers  ingredients you wouldn't believe    there's not enough veggies at all. French fries are considered a vegetable. Pizza for breakfast. They don't even get crockery. Knives and forks  No  they're too dangerous. They have scissors in the classroom  but knives and forks  No. And the way I look at it is  If you don't have knives and forks in your school  you're purely endorsing  from a state level  fast food  because it's handheld. And yes  by the way  it is fast food  It's sloppy Joes  it's burgers  it's wieners  it's pizzas  it's all of that stuff. Ten percent of what we spend on health care  as I said earlier  is on obesity  and it's going to double. We're not teaching our kids. There's no statutory right to teach kids about food  elementary or secondary school  OK  We don't teach kids about food  right  And this is a little clip from an elementary school  which is very common in England. Child  Potatoes. Jamie Oliver  Potato  So  you think these are potatoes  Do you know what that is  Do you know what that is  Child  Broccoli  JO  What about this  Our good old friend. Child  Celery. JO  No. What do you think this is  Child  Onion. JO  Onion  No. JO  Immediately you get a really clear sense of  Do the kids know anything about where food comes from   Who knows what that is  Child  Uh  pear  JO  What do you think this is  Child  I don't know. JO  If the kids don't know what stuff is  then they will never eat it. JO  Normal. England and America  England and America. Guess what fixed that. Two one hour sessions. We've got to start teaching our kids about food in schools  period. I want to tell you about something that kind of epitomizes the trouble that we're in  guys  OK  I want to talk about something so basic as milk. Every kid has the right to milk at school. Your kids will be having milk at school  breakfast and lunch  right  They'll be having two bottles  OK  And most kids do. But milk ain't good enough anymore. Don't get me wrong  I support milk    but someone at the milk board probably paid a lot of money for some geezer to work out that if you put loads of flavorings  colorings and sugar in milk  more kids will drink it. Yeah. Obviously now that's going to catch on the apple board is going to work out that if they make toffee apples they'll eat more as well. Do you know what I mean  For me  there isn't any need to flavor the milk. Okay  There's sugar in everything. I know the ins and outs of those ingredients. It's in everything. Even the milk hasn't escaped the kind of modern day problems. There's our milk. There's our carton. In that is nearly as much sugar as one of your favorite cans of fizzy pop  and they are having two a day. So  let me just show you. We've got one kid  here    having  you know  eight tablespoons of sugar a day. You know  there's your week. There's your month. And I've taken the liberty of putting in just the five years of elementary school sugar  just from milk. Now  I don't know about you guys  but judging the circumstances  right  any judge in the whole world  would look at the statistics and the evidence  and they would find any government of old guilty of child abuse. That's my belief. Now  if I came up here  and I wish I could come up here today and hang a cure for AIDS or cancer  you'd be fighting and scrambling to get to me. This  all this bad news  is preventable. That's the good news. It's very  very preventable. So  let's just think about  we got a problem here  we need to reboot. Okay so  in my world  what do we need to do  Here is the thing  right  it cannot just come from one source. To reboot and make real tangible change  real change  so that I could look you in the white of the eyes and say   In    years' time  the history of your children's lives  happiness    and let's not forget  you're clever if you eat well  you know you're going to live longer    all of that stuff  it will look different. OK   So  supermarkets. Where else do you shop so religiously  Week in  week out. How much money do you spend  in your life  in a supermarket  Love them. They just sell us what we want. All right. They owe us to put a food ambassador in every major supermarket. They need to help us shop. They need to show us how to cook quick  tasty  seasonal meals for people that are busy. This is not expensive. It is done in some  and it needs to be done across the board in America soon  and quick. The big brands  you know  the food brands  need to put food education at the heart of their businesses. I know  easier said than done. It's the future. It's the only way. Fast food. With the fast food industry you know  it's very competitive. I've had loads of secret papers and dealings with fast food restaurants. I know how they do it. I mean  basically they've weaned us on to these hits of sugar  salt and fat  and x  y  and z  and everyone loves them  right  So  these guys are going to be part of the solution. But we need to get the government to work with all of the fast food purveyors and the restaurant industry  and over a five  six  seven year period wean of us off the extreme amounts of fat  sugar and all the other non food ingredients. Now  also  back to the sort of big brands  labeling  I said earlier  is an absolute farce and has got to be sorted. OK  school. Obviously  in schools  we owe it to them to make sure those     days of the year  from that little precious age of four  until             whatever  they need to be cooked proper  fresh food from local growers on site  OK  There needs to be a new standard of fresh  proper food for your children  yeah  Under the circumstances  it's profoundly important that every single American child leaves school knowing how to cook    recipes that will save their life. Life skills. That means that they can be students  young parents  and be able to sort of duck and dive around the basics of cooking  no matter what recession hits them next time. If you can cook  recession money doesn't matter. If you can cook  time doesn't matter. The workplace  we haven't really talked about it. You know  it's now time for corporate responsibility to really look at what they feed or make available to their staff. The staff are the moms and dads of America's children. Marissa  her father died in her hand  I think she'd be quite happy if corporate America could start feeding their staff properly. Definitely they shouldn't be left out. Let's go back to the home. Now  look  if we do all this stuff  and we can  it's so achievable. You can care and be commercial. Absolutely. But the home needs to start passing on cooking again  for sure. For sure  pass it on as a philosophy. And for me  it's quite romantic  but it's about if one person teaches three people how to cook something  and they teach three of their mates  that only has to repeat itself    times  and that's the whole population of America. Romantic  yes  but most importantly  it's about trying to get people to realize that every one of your individual efforts makes a difference. We've got to put back what's been lost. Huntington's Kitchen. Huntington  where I made this program  we've got this prime time program that hopefully will inspire people to really get on this change. I truly believe that change will happen. Huntington's Kitchen. I work with a community. I worked in the schools. I found local sustainable funding to get every single school in the area from the junk  onto the fresh food  six and a half grand per school. That's all it takes  six and a half grand per school. The Kitchen is    grand a month. Okay  This can do       people a year  which is    percent of their population  and it's people on people. You know  it's local cooks teaching local people. It's free cooking lessons  guys  in the Main Street. This is real  tangible change  real  tangible change. Around America  if we just look back now  there is plenty of wonderful things going on. There is plenty of beautiful things going on. There are angels around America doing great things in schools    farm to school set ups  garden set ups  education    there are amazing people doing this already. The problem is they all want to roll out what they're doing to the next school  but there's no cash. We need to recognize the experts and the angels quickly  identify them  and allow them to easily find the resource to keep rolling out what they're already doing  and doing well. Businesses of America need to support Mrs. Obama to do the things that she wants to do. And look  I know it's weird having an English person standing here before you talking about all this. All I can say is  I care. I'm a father  and I love this country. And I believe truly  actually  that if change can be made in this country  beautiful things will happen around the world. If America does it  other people will follow. It's incredibly important. When I was in Huntington  trying to get a few things to work when they weren't  I thought  If I had a magic wand  what would I do   And I thought   You know what  I'd just love to be put in front of some of the most amazing movers and shakers in America.  And a month later  TED phoned me up and gave me this award. I'm here. So  my wish. Dyslexic  so I'm a bit slow. My wish is for you to help a strong  sustainable movement to educate every child about food  to inspire families to cook again  and to empower people everywhere to fight obesity. Thank you. About a year and a half ago  Stephen Lawler  who also gave a talk here at TED in      on Virtual Earth  brought me over to become the architect of Bing Maps  which is Microsoft's online mapping effort. In the past two and a half  we've been very hard at work on redefining the way maps work online. And we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of mapping and direction site that one is used to. So  the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning  which  if you're familiar at all with Seadragon  that's where it comes from. Mapping is  of course  not just about cartography  it's also about imagery. So  as we zoom in beyond a certain level this resolves into a kind of Sim City like virtual view at    degrees. This can be viewed from any of the cardinal directions to show you the  D structure of the city  all the facades. Now  we see this space  this three dimensional environment  as being a canvas on which all sorts of applications can play out  and map's directions are really just one of them. If you click on this  you'll see some of the ones that we've put out  just in the past couple of months since we've launched. So  for example  a couple of days after the disaster in Haiti  we had an earthquake map that showed before and after pictures from the sky. This wonderful one which I don't have time to show you is taking hyper local blogs in real time and mapping those stories  those entries to the places that are referred to on the blogs. It's wonderful. But I'm going to show you some more candy sort of stuff. So  we see the imagery  of course  not stopping at the sky. These little green bubbles represent photosynths that users have made. I'm not going to dive into them either  but photosynths are integrated into the map. Everything that's cased in blue is an area where we've taken imagery on the ground as well. And so  when you fly down    Thank you. When you fly down to the ground  and you see this kind of panoramic imagery  the first thing that you might notice is that it's not just a picture  there's just as much three dimensional understanding of this environment as there is of the three dimensional city from above  so if I click on something to get a closer view of it  then  the fact that that transition looks as it does  is a function of all of that geometry  all of that  D understanding behind this model. Now  I'll show you a fun app that    we've been working on a collaboration with our friends at Flickr. This takes Flickr  georegistered imagery and uses photosynth like processes to connect that imagery to our imagery  so    I'm not sure if that's the one I actually meant to pull up  but    But notice    this is  of course  a popular tourist site  and there are lots of photos around here  and these photos are all taken at different times. So this one was taken around five. So that's the Flickr photo  that's our imagery. So you really see how this kind of crowd sourced imagery is integrating  in a very deep way  into the map itself. Thank you. There are several reasons why this is interesting and one of them  of course  is time travel. And I'm not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery in here  but there are some with horses and carriages and so on as well. But what's cool about this is that  not only is it augmenting this visual representation of the world with things that are coming in from users  but it also is the foundation for augmented reality  and that's something that I'll be showing you more of in just a moment. Now I just made a transition indoors. That's also interesting. OK  notice there's now a roof above us. We're inside the Pike Place Market. And this is something that we're able to do with a backpack camera  so  we're now not only imaging in the street with this camera on tops of cars  but we're also imaging inside. And from here  we're able to do the same sorts of registration  not only of still images  but also of video. So this is something that we're now going to try for the first time  live  and this is really  truly  very frightening. OK. All right  guys  are you there  All right. I'm hitting it. I'm punching play. I'm live. All right. There we go. So  these are our friends in Pike Place Market  the lab. So they're broadcasting this live. OK  George  can you pan back over to the corner market  Because I want to show points of interest. No  no. The other way. Yeah  yeah  back to the corner  back to the corner. I don't want to see you guys yet. OK  OK  back to the corner  back to the corner  back to the corner. OK  never mind. What I wanted to show you was these points of interest over here on top of the image because what that gives you a sense of is the way  if you're actually on the spot  you can think about this    this is taking a step in addition to augmented reality. What the hell are you guys    oh  sorry. We're doing two different    OK  I'm hanging up now. We're doing two different things here. One of them is to take that real ... All right  let me just take a moment and thank the team. They've done a fantastic job of pulling this together. I'm going to abandon them now and walk back outside. And while I walk outside  I'll just mention that here we're using this for telepresence  but you can equally well use this on the spot  for augmented reality. When you use it on the spot  it means that you're able to bring all of that metadata and information about the world to you. So here  we're taking the extra step of also broadcasting it. That was being broadcast  by the way  on a  G network from the market. All right  and now there's one last TED talk that Microsoft has given in the past several years. And that's Curtis Wong  WorldWide Telescope. So  we're going to head over to the dumpsters  where it's traditional  after a long day at the market  to go out for a break  but also stare up at the sky. This is the integration of WorldWide Telescope into our maps. This is the current    thank you    this is the current time. If we scrub the time  then we can see how the sky will look at different times  and we can get all of this very detailed information about different times  different dates  Let's move the moon a little higher in the sky  maybe change the date. I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon. So  this is an astronomically complete representation of the sky integrated right into the Earth. All right now  I've overrun my time  so I've got to stop. Thank you all very much. Someone once said that politics is  of course   showbiz for ugly people.  So  on that basis  I feel like I've really arrived. The other thing to think of is what an honor it is  as a politician  to give a TED talk  particularly here in the U.K.  where the reputation of politics  with the expenses scandal  has sunk so low. There was even a story recently that scientists had thought about actually replacing rats in their experiments with politicians. And someone asked  Why   and they said   Well  there's no shortage of politicians  no one really minds what happens to them and  after all  there are some things that rats just won't do.  Now  I know you all love data  so I'm starting with a data rich slide. This  I think  is the most important fact to bear in mind in British politics or American politics  and that is  We have run out of money. We have vast budget deficits. This is my global public debt clock  and  as you can see  it's    trillion and counting. And I think what this leads to is a very simple recognition  that there's one question in politics at the moment above all other  and it's this one  How do we make things better without spending more money  Because there isn't going to be a lot of money to improve public services  or to improve government  or to improve so many of the things that politicians talk about. So what follows from that is that if you think it's all about money    you can only measure success in public services in health care and education and policing by spending more money  you can only measure progress by spending money    you're going to have a pretty miserable time. But if you think a whole lot of other things matter that lead up to well being    things like your family relationships  friendship  community  values    then  actually  this is an incredibly exciting time to be in politics. And the really simple argument I want to make tonight  the really straightforward argument is this  That if we combine the right political philosophy  the right political thinking  with the incredible information revolution that has taken place  and that all of you know so much more about than I do  I think there's an incredible opportunity to actually remake politics  remake government  remake public services  and achieve what's up on that slide  which is a big increase in our well being. That's the argument I want to make tonight. So  starting with the political philosophy. Now I'm not saying for a minute that British Conservatives have all the answers. Of course we don't. But there are two things at heart that I think drive a conservative philosophy that are really relevant to this whole debate. The first is this  We believe that if you give people more power and control over their lives  if you give people more choice  if you put them in the driving seat  then actually  you can create a stronger and better society. And if you marry this fact with the incredible abundance of information that we have in our world today  I think you can completely  as I've said  remake politics  remake government  remake your public services. The second thing we believe is we believe in going with the grain of human nature. Politics and politicians will only succeed if they actually try and treat with people as they are  rather than as they would like them to be. Now  if you combine this very simple  very conservative thought    go with the grain of human nature    with all the advances in behavioral economics  some of which we were just hearing about  again  I think we can achieve a real increase in well being  in happiness  in a stronger society without necessarily having to spend a whole lot more money. Now  why do I think now is the moment to make this argument  Well  I'm afraid you're going to suffer a short  condensed history lesson about what I would say are the three passages of history  the pre bureaucratic age  the bureaucratic age and what we now live in  which I think is a post bureaucratic age. A simpler way of thinking of it is that we have gone from a world of local control  then we went to a world of central control  and now we're in a world of people control. Local power  central power  now  people power. Now  here is King Cnut  king a thousand years ago. Thought he could turn back the waves  couldn't turn back the waves. Couldn't actually turn back very much  because if you were king a thousand years ago  while it still took hours and hours and weeks and weeks to traverse your own country  there wasn't much you were in charge of. You weren't in charge of policing  justice  education  health  welfare. You could just about go to war and that was about it. This was the pre bureaucratic age  an age in which everything had to be local. You had to have local control because there was no nationally available information because travel was so restricted. So this was the pre bureaucratic age. Next part of the cold history lesson  the lovely picture of the British Industrial Revolution. Suddenly  all sorts of transport  travel information were possible  and this gave birth to  what I like to call  the bureaucratic age. And hopefully this slide is going to morph beautifully. There we are. Suddenly  you have the big  strong  central state. It was able    but only it was able    to organize health care  education  policing  justice. And it was a world of  as I say  not local power  but now central power. It had sucked all that power up from the localities. It was able to do that itself. The next great stage  which all of you are so familiar with  the massive information revolution. Just consider this one fact  One hundred years ago  sending these    words cost    dollars. Right now  here we are linked up to Long Beach and everywhere else  and all these secret locations for a fraction of that cost  and we can send and receive huge quantities of information without it costing anything. So we're now living in a post bureaucratic age  where genuine people power is possible. Now  what does this mean for our politics  for our public services  for our government  Well I can't  in the time I've got  give huge numbers of examples  but let me just give a few of the ways that life can change. And this is so obvious  in a way  because you think about how all of you have changed the way we shop  the way we travel  the way that business is done. That is already happened  the information and Internet revolution has actually gone all the way through our societies in so many different ways  but it hasn't  in every way  yet touched our government. So  how could this happen  Well  I think there are three chief ways that it should make an enormous difference  in transparency  in greater choice and in accountability  in giving us that genuine people power. If we take transparency  here is one of my favorite websites  the Missouri Accountability Portal. In the old days  only the government could hold the information  and only a few elected people could try and grab that information and question it and challenge it. Now here  on one website  one state in America  every single dollar spent by that government is searchable  is analyzable  is checkable. Think of the huge change that means  Any business that wants to bid for a government contract can see what currently is being spent. Anyone thinking   I could do that service better  I could deliver it cheaper   it's all available there. We have only  in government and in politics  started to scratch the surface of what people are doing in the commercial world with the information revolution. So  complete transparency will make a huge difference. In this country  if we win the election  we are going to make all government spending over        pounds transparent and available online  searchable for anyone to see. We're going to make every contract    we're announcing this today    available on the Internet so anyone can see what the terms are  what the conditions are  driving huge value for money  but also huge increases  I believe  in well being as well. Choice. Now you all shop online  compare online  do everything online  and yet this revolution has hardly touched the surface of public services like education  or health care or policing  and you're going to see this change massively. We should be making this change with the information revolution in our country  with searchable health sites  so you can see what operations work out properly  what records doctors have  the cleanliness of hospitals  who does best at infection control    all of the information that would once be locked in the Department of Health is now available for all of us to see. And the third of these big changes  accountability. This  I think  is a huge change. It is a crime map. This is a crime map from Chicago. So  instead of having a situation where only the police have the information about which crimes are committed where  and we have to employ people in government to try and hold the police to account  suddenly  we've got this vast opportunity for people power  where we  as citizens  can see what crimes are being committed    where  when and by whom    and we can hold the police to account. And you can see this looks a bit like a chef's hat  but actually that's an assault  the one in blue. You can see what crime is committed where  and you have the opportunity to hold your police force to account. So those three ways    transparency  accountability and choice    will make a huge difference. Now I also said the other principle that I think we should work on is understanding of people  is recognizing that going with the grain of human nature you can achieve so much more. Now  we're got a huge revolution in understanding of why people behave in the way that they do  and a great opportunity to put that knowledge and information to greater use. We're working with some of these people. We're being advised by some of these people  as was said  to try and bring all the experience to book. Let me just give you one example that I think is incredibly simple  and I love. We want to get people to be more energy efficient. Why  It cuts fuel poverty  it cuts their bills  and it cuts carbon emissions at the same time. How do you do it  Well  we've had government information campaigns over the years when they tell you to switch off the lights when you leave the home. We even had    one government minister once told us to brush our teeth in the dark. I don't think they lasted very long. Look at what this does. This is a simple piece of behavioral economics. The best way to get someone to cut their electricity bill is to show them their own spending  to show them what their neighbors are spending  and then show what an energy conscious neighbor is spending. That sort of behavioral economics can transform people's behavior in a way that all the bullying and all the information and all the badgering from a government cannot possibly achieve. Other examples are recycling. We all know we need to recycle more. How do we make it happen  All the proof from America is that actually  if you pay people to recycle  if you give them a carrot rather than a stick  you can transform their behavior. So what does all this add up to  Here are my two favorite U.S. speeches of the last    years. Obviously  here we have JFK with that incredibly simple and powerful formulation   Ask not what your country can do for you  ask what you can do for your country   an incredibly noble sentiment. But when he made that speech  what could you do to build the stronger  better society  You could fight for your country  you could die for your country  you could serve in your country's civil service  but you didn't really have the information and the knowledge and the ability to help build the stronger society in the way that you do now. And I think an even more wonderful speech  which I'm going to read a big chunk of  which sums up what I said at the beginning about believing there is more to life than money  and more that we should try and measure than money. And it is Robert Kennedy's beautiful description of why gross national product captures so little  It  does not allow for the health of our children  the quality of their education  or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages  the intelligence of our public debate. It measures neither our wit nor our courage  neither our wisdom nor our learning  neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country. It measures everything  in short  except that which makes life worthwhile.  Again  a sentiment that was so noble and beautifully put    years ago  and a beautiful dream    years ago  but now with the huge advances in information technology  with the massive changes in behavioral economics  with all that we know about how you advance well being  that if we combine those insights of giving power to people  and using information to make that possible  and using the insight of going with the grain of human nature  while at the same time  understanding why people behave in the way they do  it is a dream more easy to realize today than it was when it was made in that beautiful speech    years ago. Thank you. I'd like to share with you a discovery that I made a few months ago while writing an article for Italian Wired. I always keep my thesaurus handy whenever I'm writing anything  but I'd already finished editing the piece  and I realized that I had never once in my life looked up the word  disabled  to see what I'd find. Let me read you the entry.  Disabled  adjective  crippled  helpless  useless  wrecked  stalled  maimed  wounded  mangled  lame  mutilated  run down  worn out  weakened  impotent  castrated  paralyzed  handicapped  senile  decrepit  laid up  done up  done for  done in cracked up  counted out  see also hurt  useless and weak. Antonyms  healthy  strong  capable.  I was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing  it was so ludicrous  but I'd just gotten past  mangled   and my voice broke  and I had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock and impact that the assault from these words unleashed. You know  of course  this is my raggedy old thesaurus so I'm thinking this must be an ancient print date  right  But  in fact  the print date was the early     s  when I would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me. And  needless to say  thank God I wasn't using a thesaurus back then. I mean  from this entry  it would seem that I was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them  when in fact  today I'm celebrated for the opportunities and adventures my life has procured. So  I immediately went to look up the      online edition  expecting to find a revision worth noting. Here's the updated version of this entry. Unfortunately  it's not much better. I find the last two words under  Near Antonyms   particularly unsettling   whole  and  wholesome.  So  it's not just about the words. It's what we believe about people when we name them with these words. It's about the values behind the words  and how we construct those values. Our language affects our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people. In fact  many ancient societies  including the Greeks and the Romans  believed that to utter a curse verbally was so powerful  because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence. So  what reality do we want to call into existence  a person who is limited  or a person who's empowered  By casually doing something as simple as naming a person  a child  we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power. Wouldn't we want to open doors for them instead  One such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the A.I. duPont Institute in Wilmington  Delaware. His name was Dr. Pizzutillo  an Italian American  whose name  apparently  was too difficult for most Americans to pronounce  so he went by Dr. P. And Dr. P always wore really colorful bow ties and had the very perfect disposition to work with children. I loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital  with the exception of my physical therapy sessions. I had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick  elastic bands    different colors  you know    to help build up my leg muscles  and I hated these bands more than anything    I hated them  had names for them. I hated them. And  you know  I was already bargaining  as a five year old child  with Dr. P to try to get out of doing these exercises  unsuccessfully  of course. And  one day  he came in to my session    exhaustive and unforgiving  these sessions    and he said to me   Wow. Aimee  you are such a strong and powerful little girl  I think you're going to break one of those bands. When you do break it  I'm going to give you a hundred bucks.  Now  of course  this was a simple ploy on Dr. P's part to get me to do the exercises I didn't want to do before the prospect of being the richest five year old in the second floor ward  but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me. And I have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong  powerful and athletic person well into the future. This is an example of how adults in positions of power can ignite the power of a child. But  in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries  our language isn't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want  the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable. Our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society  many of which have been brought about by technology. Certainly  from a medical standpoint  my legs  laser surgery for vision impairment  titanium knees and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities  and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them    not to mention social networking platforms allow people to self identify  to claim their own descriptions of themselves  so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing. So  perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth  that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society  and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset. The human ability to adapt  it's an interesting thing  because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity  and I'm going to make an admission  This phrase never sat right with me  and I always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it  and I think I'm starting to figure out why. Implicit in this phrase of  overcoming adversity  is the idea that success  or happiness  is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience  as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics  or what other people perceive as my disability. But  in fact  we are changed. We are marked  of course  by a challenge  whether physically  emotionally or both. And I'm going to suggest that this is a good thing. Adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our life. It's part of our life. And I tend to think of it like my shadow. Sometimes I see a lot of it  sometimes there's very little  but it's always with me. And  certainly  I'm not trying to diminish the impact  the weight  of a person's struggle. There is adversity and challenge in life  and it's all very real and relative to every single person  but the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet adversity  but how you're going to meet it. So  our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity  but preparing them to meet it well. And we do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt. There's an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not I'm disabled. And  truthfully  the only real and consistent disability I've had to confront is the world ever thinking that I could be described by those definitions. In our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold  hard truth about their medical prognosis  or  indeed  a prognosis on the expected quality of their life  we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall that will actually disable someone. Perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it  serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself. By not treating the wholeness of a person  by not acknowledging their potency  we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have. We are effectively grading someone's worth to our community. So we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability. And  most importantly  there's a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability. So it's not about devaluing  or negating  these more trying times as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug  but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity. So maybe the idea I want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it  embracing it  grappling with it  to use a wrestling term  maybe even dancing with it. And  perhaps  if we see adversity as natural  consistent and useful  we're less burdened by the presence of it. This year we celebrate the    th birthday of Charles Darwin  and it was     years ago  when writing about evolution  that Darwin illustrated  I think  a truth about the human character. To paraphrase  It's not the strongest of the species that survives  nor is it the most intelligent that survives  it is the one that is most adaptable to change. Conflict is the genesis of creation. From Darwin's work  amongst others  we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation. So  again  transformation  adaptation  is our greatest human skill. And  perhaps  until we're tested  we don't know what we're made of. Maybe that's what adversity gives us  a sense of self  a sense of our own power. So  we can give ourselves a gift. We can re imagine adversity as something more than just tough times. Maybe we can see it as change. Adversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves to yet. I think the greatest adversity that we've created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy. Now  who's normal  There's no normal. There's common  there's typical. There's no normal  and would you want to meet that poor  beige person if they existed  I don't think so. If we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normalcy to one of possibility    or potency  to be even a little bit more dangerous    we can release the power of so many more children  and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community. Anthropologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use  to be able to contribute. There's evidence that Neanderthals         years ago  carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury  and perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community. They didn't view these people as broken and useless  they were seen as rare and valuable. A few years ago  I was in a food market in the town where I grew up in that red zone in northeastern Pennsylvania  and I was standing over a bushel of tomatoes. It was summertime  I had shorts on. I hear this guy  his voice behind me say   Well  if it isn't Aimee Mullins.  And I turn around  and it's this older man. I have no idea who he is. And I said   I'm sorry  sir  have we met  I don't remember meeting you.  He said   Well  you wouldn't remember meeting me. I mean  when we met I was delivering you from your mother's womb.  Oh  that guy. And  but of course  actually  it did click. This man was Dr. Kean  a man that I had only known about through my mother's stories of that day  because  of course  typical fashion  I arrived late for my birthday by two weeks. And so my mother's prenatal physician had gone on vacation  so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents. And  because I was born without the fibula bones  and had feet turned in  and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that  he had to be the bearer    this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news. He said to me   I had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk  and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence  and you've been making liar out of me ever since.  The extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clippings throughout my whole childhood  whether winning a second grade spelling bee  marching with the Girl Scouts  you know  the Halloween parade  winning my college scholarship  or any of my sports victories  and he was using it  and integrating it into teaching resident students  med students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School. And he called this part of the course the X Factor  the potential of the human will. No prognosis can account for how powerful this could be as a determinant in the quality of someone's life. And Dr. Kean went on to tell me  he said   In my experience  unless repeatedly told otherwise  and even if given a modicum of support  if left to their own devices  a child will achieve.  See  Dr. Kean made that shift in thinking. He understood that there's a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it. And there's been a shift in my thinking over time  in that  if you had asked me at    years old  if I would have traded prosthetics for flesh and bone legs  I wouldn't have hesitated for a second. I aspired to that kind of normalcy back then. But if you ask me today  I'm not so sure. And it's because of the experiences I've had with them  not in spite of the experiences I've had with them. And perhaps this shift in me has happened because I've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me. See  all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power  and you're off. If you can hand somebody the key to their own power    the human spirit is so receptive    if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment  you are educating them in the best sense. You're teaching them to open doors for themselves. In fact  the exact meaning of the word  educate  comes from the root word  educe.  It means  to bring forth what is within  to bring out potential.  So again  which potential do we want to bring out  There was a case study done in     s Britain  when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools. It's called the streaming trials. We call it  tracking  here in the States. It's separating students from A  B  C  D and so on. And the  A students  get the tougher curriculum  the best teachers  etc. Well  they took  over a three month period  D level students  gave them A's  told them they were  A's   told them they were bright  and at the end of this three month period  they were performing at A level. And  of course  the heartbreaking  flip side of this study  is that they took the  A students  and told them they were  D's.  And that's what happened at the end of that three month period. Those who were still around in school  besides the people who had dropped out. A crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too. The teachers didn't know a switch had been made. They were simply told   These are the 'A students ' these are the 'D students.'  And that's how they went about teaching them and treating them. So  I think that the only true disability is a crushed spirit  a spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope  it doesn't see beauty  it no longer has our natural  childlike curiosity and our innate ability to imagine. If instead  we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope  to see beauty in themselves and others  to be curious and imaginative  then we are truly using our power well. When a spirit has those qualities  we are able to create new realities and new ways of being. I'd like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth century Persian poet named Hafiz that my friend  Jacques Dembois told me about  and the poem is called  The God Who Only Knows Four Words    Every child has known God  not the God of names  not the God of don'ts  but the God who only knows four words and keeps repeating them  saying  'Come dance with me. Come  dance with me. Come  dance with me.'  Thank you. I'm going to talk today about energy and climate. And that might seem a bit surprising because my full time work at the Foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds  about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion live better lives. But energy and climate are extremely important to these people    in fact  more important than to anyone else on the planet. The climate getting worse means that many years  their crops won't grow  There will be too much rain  not enough rain  things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can't support. And that leads to starvation  it leads to uncertainty  it leads to unrest. So  the climate changes will be terrible for them. Also  the price of energy is very important to them. In fact  if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of  to reduce poverty  by far you would pick energy. Now  the price of energy has come down over time. Really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy. The coal revolution fueled the Industrial Revolution  and  even in the     s we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity  and that's why we have refrigerators  air conditioning  we can make modern materials and do so many things. And so  we're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world. But  as we make it cheaper    and let's go for making it twice as cheap    we need to meet a new constraint  and that constraint has to do with CO . CO  is warming the planet  and the equation on CO  is actually a very straightforward one. If you sum up the CO  that gets emitted  that leads to a temperature increase  and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects  the effects on the weather  perhaps worse  the indirect effects  in that the natural ecosystems can't adjust to these rapid changes  and so you get ecosystem collapses. Now  the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of CO  to what temperature will be and where the positive feedbacks are  there's some uncertainty there  but not very much. And there's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be  but they will be extremely bad. I asked the top scientists on this several times  Do we really have to get down to near zero  Can't we just cut it in half or a quarter  And the answer is that until we get near to zero  the temperature will continue to rise. And so that's a big challenge. It's very different than saying  We're a twelve foot high truck trying to get under a ten foot bridge  and we can just sort of squeeze under.  This is something that has to get to zero. Now  we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year  over    billion tons. For each American  it's about    tons  for people in poor countries  it's less than one ton. It's an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet. And  somehow  we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero. It's been constantly going up. It's only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all  so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling  and falling all the way to zero. This equation has four factors  a little bit of multiplication  So  you've got a thing on the left  CO   that you want to get to zero  and that's going to be based on the number of people  the services each person's using on average  the energy on average for each service  and the CO  being put out per unit of energy. So  let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero. Probably  one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero. Now that's back from high school algebra  but let's take a look. First  we've got population. The world today has  .  billion people. That's headed up to about nine billion. Now  if we do a really great job on new vaccines  health care  reproductive health services  we could lower that by  perhaps     or    percent  but there we see an increase of about  . . The second factor is the services we use. This encompasses everything  the food we eat  clothing  TV  heating. These are very good things  getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet. And it's a great thing for this number to go up. In the rich world  perhaps the top one billion  we probably could cut back and use less  but every year  this number  on average  is going to go up  and so  over all  that will more than double the services delivered per person. Here we have a very basic service  Do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework  And  in fact  these kids don't  so they're going out and reading their school work under the street lamps. Now  efficiency  E  the energy for each service  here finally we have some good news. We have something that's not going up. Through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting  through different types of cars  different ways of building buildings    there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially. Some individual services even bring it down by    percent. There are other services like how we make fertilizer  or how we do air transport  where the rooms for improvement are far  far less. And so  overall here  if we're optimistic  we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even  perhaps  a factor of six. But for these first three factors now  we've gone from    billion to  at best  maybe    billion tons  and that just won't cut it. So let's look at this fourth factor    this is going to be a key one    and this is the amount of CO  put out per each unit of energy. And so the question is  Can you actually get that to zero  If you burn coal  no. If you burn natural gas  no. Almost every way we make electricity today  except for the emerging renewables and nuclear  puts out CO . And so  what we're going to have to do at a global scale  is create a new system. And so  we need energy miracles. Now  when I use the term  miracle   I don't mean something that's impossible. The microprocessor is a miracle. The personal computer is a miracle. The Internet and its services are a miracle. So  the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles. Usually  we don't have a deadline  where you have to get the miracle by a certain date. Usually  you just kind of stand by  and some come along  some don't. This is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline. Now  I thought   How could I really capture this  Is there some kind of natural illustration  some demonstration that would grab people's imagination here   I thought back to a year ago when I brought mosquitos  and somehow people enjoyed that. It really got them involved in the idea of  you know  there are people who live with mosquitos. So  with energy  all I could come up with is this. I decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment here this year. So here we have some natural fireflies. I'm told they don't bite  in fact  they might not even leave that jar. Now  there's all sorts of gimmicky solutions like that one  but they don't really add up to much. We need solutions    either one or several    that have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability  and  although there's many directions people are seeking  I really only see five that can achieve the big numbers. I've left out tide  geothermal  fusion  biofuels. Those may make some contribution  and if they can do better than I expect  so much the better  but my key point here is that we're going to have to work on each of these five  and we can't give up any of them because they look daunting  because they all have significant challenges. Let's look first at the burning fossil fuels  either burning coal or burning natural gas. What you need to do there  seems like it might be simple  but it's not  and that's to take all the CO   after you've burned it  going out the flue  pressurize it  create a liquid  put it somewhere  and hope it stays there. Now we have some pilot things that do this at the    to    percent level  but getting up to that full percentage  that will be very tricky  and agreeing on where these CO  quantities should be put will be hard  but the toughest one here is this long term issue. Who's going to be sure  Who's going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things  This is a lot of volume. So that's a tough one. Next would be nuclear. It also has three big problems  Cost  particularly in highly regulated countries  is high  the issue of the safety  really feeling good about nothing could go wrong  that  even though you have these human operators  that the fuel doesn't get used for weapons. And then what do you do with the waste  And  although it's not very large  there are a lot of concerns about that. People need to feel good about it. So three very tough problems that might be solvable  and so  should be worked on. The last three of the five  I've grouped together. These are what people often refer to as the renewable sources. And they actually    although it's great they don't require fuel    they have some disadvantages. One is that the density of energy gathered in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant. This is energy farming  so you're talking about many square miles  thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant. Also  these are intermittent sources. The sun doesn't shine all day  it doesn't shine every day  and  likewise  the wind doesn't blow all the time. And so  if you depend on these sources  you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time periods that it's not available. So  we've got big cost challenges here  we have transmission challenges  for example  say this energy source is outside your country  you not only need the technology  but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere. And  finally  this storage problem. And  to dimensionalize this  I went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made    for cars  for computers  for phones  for flashlights  for everything    and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses  and what I found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than    minutes of all the energy. And so  in fact  we need a big breakthrough here  something that's going to be a factor of     better than the approaches we have now. It's not impossible  but it's not a very easy thing. Now  this shows up when you try to get the intermittent source to be above  say     to    percent of what you're using. If you're counting on it for     percent  you need an incredible miracle battery. Now  how we're going to go forward on this    what's the right approach  Is it a Manhattan Project  What's the thing that can get us there  Well  we need lots of companies working on this  hundreds. In each of these five paths  we need at least a hundred people. And a lot of them  you'll look at and say   They're crazy.  That's good. And  I think  here in the TED group  we have many people who are already pursuing this. Bill Gross has several companies  including one called eSolar that has some great solar thermal technologies. Vinod Khosla's investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities  and I'm trying to help back that. Nathan Myhrvold and I actually are backing a company that  perhaps surprisingly  is actually taking the nuclear approach. There are some innovations in nuclear  modular  liquid. And innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago  so the idea that there's some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising. The idea of TerraPower is that  instead of burning a part of uranium    the one percent  which is the U       we decided   Let's burn the    percent  the U   .  It is kind of a crazy idea. In fact  people had talked about it for a long time  but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not  and so it's through the advent of modern supercomputers that now you can simulate and see that  yes  with the right material's approach  this looks like it would work. And  because you're burning that    percent  you have greatly improved cost profile. You actually burn up the waste  and you can actually use as fuel all the leftover waste from today's reactors. So  instead of worrying about them  you just take that. It's a great thing. It breathes this uranium as it goes along  so it's kind of like a candle. You can see it's a log there  often referred to as a traveling wave reactor. In terms of fuel  this really solves the problem. I've got a picture here of a place in Kentucky. This is the leftover  the    percent  where they've taken out the part they burn now  so it's called depleted uranium. That would power the U.S. for hundreds of years. And  simply by filtering seawater in an inexpensive process  you'd have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet. So  you know  it's got lots of challenges ahead  but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward. So let's think  How should we measure ourselves  What should our report card look like  Well  let's go out to where we really need to get  and then look at the intermediate. For       you've heard many people talk about this    percent reduction. That really is very important  that we get there. And that    percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries  still some agriculture  hopefully we will have cleaned up forestry  cement. So  to get to that    percent  the developed countries  including countries like China  will have had to switch their electricity generation altogether. So  the other grade is  Are we deploying this zero emission technology  have we deployed it in all the developed countries and we're in the process of getting it elsewhere  That's super important. That's a key element of making that report card. So  backing up from there  what should the      report card look like  Well  again  it should have the two elements. We should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions  The less we emit  the less that sum will be of CO   and  therefore  the less the temperature. But in some ways  the grade we get there  doing things that don't get us all the way to the big reductions  is only equally  or maybe even slightly less  important than the other  which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs. These breakthroughs  we need to move those at full speed  and we can measure that in terms of companies  pilot projects  regulatory things that have been changed. There's a lot of great books that have been written about this. The Al Gore book   Our Choice  and the David McKay book   Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air.  They really go through it and create a framework that this can be discussed broadly  because we need broad backing for this. There's a lot that has to come together. So this is a wish. It's a very concrete wish that we invent this technology. If you gave me only one wish for the next    years    I could pick who's president  I could pick a vaccine  which is something I love  or I could pick that this thing that's half the cost with no CO  gets invented    this is the wish I would pick. This is the one with the greatest impact. If we don't get this wish  the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible  between the U.S. and China  between poor countries and rich  and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse. So  what do we have to do  What am I appealing to you to step forward and drive  We need to go for more research funding. When countries get together in places like Copenhagen  they shouldn't just discuss the CO . They should discuss this innovation agenda  and you'd be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending on these innovative approaches. We do need the market incentives    CO  tax  cap and trade    something that gets that price signal out there. We need to get the message out. We need to have this dialogue be a more rational  more understandable dialogue  including the steps that the government takes. This is an important wish  but it is one I think we can achieve. Thank you. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So to understand more about TerraPower  right    I mean  first of all  can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is  Bil Gates  To actually do the software  buy the supercomputer  hire all the great scientists  which we've done  that's only tens of millions  and even once we test our materials out in a Russian reactor to make sure that our materials work properly  then you'll only be up in the hundreds of millions. The tough thing is building the pilot reactor  finding the several billion  finding the regulator  the location that will actually build the first one of these. Once you get the first one built  if it works as advertised  then it's just clear as day  because the economics  the energy density  are so different than nuclear as we know it. CA  And so  to understand it right  this involves building deep into the ground almost like a vertical kind of column of nuclear fuel  of this sort of spent uranium  and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down  BG  That's right. Today  you're always refueling the reactor  so you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong  that thing where you're opening it up and moving things in and out  that's not good. So  if you have very cheap fuel that you can put    years in    just think of it as a log    put it down and not have those same complexities. And it just sits there and burns for the    years  and then it's done. CA  It's a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution. BG  Yeah. Well  what happens with the waste  you can let it sit there    there's a lot less waste under this approach    then you can actually take that  and put it into another one and burn that. And we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today  that's sitting in these cooling pools or dry casking by reactors    that's our fuel to begin with. So  the thing that's been a problem from those reactors is actually what gets fed into ours  and you're reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically as you're going through this process. CA  I mean  you're talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here. Where is there most interest in actually doing something with this  BG  Well  we haven't picked a particular place  and there's all these interesting disclosure rules about anything that's called  nuclear   so we've got a lot of interest  that people from the company have been in Russia  India  China    I've been back seeing the secretary of energy here  talking about how this fits into the energy agenda. So I'm optimistic. You know  the French and Japanese have done some work. This is a variant on something that has been done. It's an important advance  but it's like a fast reactor  and a lot of countries have built them  so anybody who's done a fast reactor is a candidate to be where the first one gets built. CA  So  in your mind  timescale and likelihood of actually taking something like this live  BG  Well  we need    for one of these high scale  electro generation things that's very cheap  we have    years to invent and then    years to deploy. That's sort of the deadline that the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet. And  you know  TerraPower  if things go well    which is wishing for a lot    could easily meet that. And there are  fortunately now  dozens of companies    we need it to be hundreds    who  likewise  if their science goes well  if the funding for their pilot plants goes well  that they can compete for this. And it's best if multiple succeed  because then you could use a mix of these things. We certainly need one to succeed. CA  In terms of big scale possible game changes  is this the biggest that you're aware of out there  BG  An energy breakthrough is the most important thing. It would have been  even without the environmental constraint  but the environmental constraint just makes it so much greater. In the nuclear space  there are other innovators. You know  we don't know their work as well as we know this one  but the modular people  that's a different approach. There's a liquid type reactor  which seems a little hard  but maybe they say that about us. And so  there are different ones  but the beauty of this is a molecule of uranium has a million times as much energy as a molecule of  say  coal  and so    if you can deal with the negatives  which are essentially the radiation    the footprint and cost  the potential  in terms of effect on land and various things  is almost in a class of its own. CA  If this doesn't work  then what  Do we have to start taking emergency measures to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable  BG  If you get into that situation  it's like if you've been over eating  and you're about to have a heart attack  Then where do you go  You may need heart surgery or something. There is a line of research on what's called geoengineering  which are various techniques that would delay the heating to buy us    or    years to get our act together. Now  that's just an insurance policy. You hope you don't need to do that. Some people say you shouldn't even work on the insurance policy because it might make you lazy  that you'll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you. I'm not sure that's wise  given the importance of the problem  but there's now the geoengineering discussion about    should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster  or this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect  CA  Climate skeptics  If you had a sentence or two to say to them  how might you persuade them that they're wrong  BG  Well  unfortunately  the skeptics come in different camps. The ones who make scientific arguments are very few. Are they saying that there's negative feedback effects that have to do with clouds that offset things  There are very  very few things that they can even say there's a chance in a million of those things. The main problem we have here  it's kind of like AIDS. You make the mistake now  and you pay for it a lot later. And so  when you have all sorts of urgent problems  the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later  and a somewhat uncertain pain thing    in fact  the IPCC report  that's not necessarily the worst case  and there are people in the rich world who look at IPCC and say   OK  that isn't that big of a deal.  The fact is it's that uncertain part that should move us towards this. But my dream here is that  if you can make it economic  and meet the CO  constraints  then the skeptics say   OK  I don't care that it doesn't put out CO   I kind of wish it did put out CO   but I guess I'll accept it because it's cheaper than what's come before.  CA  And so  that would be your response to the Bjorn Lomborg argument  that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the CO  problem  it's going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth  it's a stupid waste of the Earth's resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do. BG  Well  the actual spending on the R D piece    say the U.S. should spend    billion a year more than it is right now    it's not that dramatic. It shouldn't take away from other things. The thing you get into big money on  and this  reasonable people can disagree  is when you have something that's non economic and you're trying to fund that    that  to me  mostly is a waste. Unless you're very close and you're just funding the learning curve and it's going to get very cheap  I believe we should try more things that have a potential to be far less expensive. If the trade off you get into is   Let's make energy super expensive   then the rich can afford that. I mean  all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lifestyle. The disaster is for that two billion. And even Lomborg has changed. His shtick now is   Why isn't the R D getting more discussed   He's still  because of his earlier stuff  still associated with the skeptic camp  but he's realized that's a pretty lonely camp  and so  he's making the R D point. And so there is a thread of something that I think is appropriate. The R D piece  it's crazy how little it's funded. CA  Well Bill  I suspect I speak on the behalf of most people here to say I really hope your wish comes true. Thank you so much. BG  Thank you. I want to talk about my investigations into what technology means in our lives    not just our immediate life  but in the cosmic sense  in the kind of long history of the world and our place in the world  What is this stuff  What is the significance  And so  I want to kind of go through my little story of what I found out. And one of the first things that I started to investigate was the history of the name of technology. And in the United States there is a State of the Union address given by every president since     . And each one of those is really kind of summing up the most important things for the United States at that time. If you search for the word  technology   it was not used until     . So  technology was sort of absent from everybody's thinking until       which happened to be the year of my birth. And obviously  technology had existed before then  but we weren't aware of it  and so it was sort of an awakening of this force in our life. I actually did research to find out the first use of the word  technology.  It was in       and it was invented by a guy who was starting a curriculum    a course  bringing together all the kinds of arts and crafts  and industry    and he called it  Technology.  And that's the very first use of the word. So  what is this stuff that we're all consumed by  and bothered by  Alan Kay calls it   Technology is anything that was invented after you were born.  Which is sort of the idea that we normally have about what technology is  It's all that new stuff. It's not roads  or penicillin  or factory tires  it's the new stuff. My friend Danny Hillis says kind of a similar one  he says   Technology is anything that doesn't work yet.  Which is  again  a sense that it's all new. But we know that it's just not new. It actually goes way back  and what I want to suggest is it goes a long way back. So  another way to think about technology  what it means  is to imagine a world without technology. If we were to eliminate every single bit of technology in the world today    and I mean everything  from blades to scrapers to cloth    we as a species would not live very long. We would die by the billions  and very quickly  The wolves would get us  we would be defenseless  we would be unable to grow enough food  or find enough food. Even the hunter gatherers used some elementary tools. And so  they had minimal technology  but they had some technology. And if we study those hunter gatherer tribes and the Neanderthal  which are very similar to early man  we find out a very curious thing about this world without technology  and this is a kind of a curve of their average age. There are no Neanderthal fossils that are older than    years old that we've ever found  and the average age of most of these hunter gatherer tribes is    to   . There are very few young infants because they die    high mortality rate    and there's very few old people. And so the profile is sort of for your average San Francisco neighborhood  a lot of young people. And if you go there  you say   Hey  everybody's really healthy.  Well  that's because they're all young. And the same thing with the hunter gatherer tribes and early man is that you didn't live beyond the age of   . So  it was a world without grandparents. And grandparents are very important  because they are the transmitter of cultural evolution and information. Imagine a world and basically everybody was    to    years old. How much learning can you do  You can't do very much learning in your own life  it's so short  and there's nobody to pass on what you do learn. So  that's one aspect. It was a very short life. But at the same time anthropologists know that most hunter gatherer tribes of the world  with that very little technology  actually did not spend a very long time gathering the food that they needed  three to six hours a day. Some anthropologists call that the original affluent society. Because they had banker hours basically. So  it was possible to get enough food. But when the scarcity came when the highs and lows and the droughts came  then people went into starvation. And that's why they didn't live very long. So  what technology brought  through the very simple tools like these stone tools here    even something as small as this    the early bands of humans were actually able to eliminate to extinction about     megafauna animals in North America when they first arrived        years ago. So  long before the industrial age we've been affecting the planet on a global scale  with just a small amount of technology. The other thing that the early man invented was fire. And fire was used to clear out  and again  affected the ecology of grass and whole continents  and was used in cooking. It enabled us to actually eat all kinds of things. It was sort of  in a certain sense  in a McLuhan sense  an external stomach  in the sense that it was cooking food that we could not eat otherwise. And if we don't have fire  we actually could not live. Our bodies have adapted to these new diets. Our bodies have changed in the last        years. So  with that little bit of technology  humans went from a small band of        or so    the same number as Neanderthals everywhere    and we suddenly exploded. With the invention of language around        years ago  the number of humans exploded  and very quickly became the dominant species on the planet. And they migrated into the rest of the world at two kilometers per year until  within several tens of thousands of years  we occupied every single watershed on the planet and became the most dominant species  with a very small amount of technology. And even at that time  with the introduction of agriculture                years ago we started to see climate change. So  climate change is not a new thing. What's new is just the degree of it. Even during the agricultural age there was climate change. And so  already small amounts of technology were transforming the world. And what this means  and where I'm going  is that technology has become the most powerful force in the world. All the things that we see today that are changing our lives  we can always trace back to the introduction of some new technology. So  it's a force that is the most powerful force that has been unleashed on this planet  and in such a degree that I think that it's become our    who we are. In fact  our humanity  and everything that we think about ourselves is something that we've invented. So  we've invented ourselves. Of all the animals that we have domesticated  the most important animal that we've domesticated has been us. Okay  So  humanity is our greatest invention. But of course we're not done yet. We're still inventing  and this is what technology is allowing us to do    it's continually to reinvent ourselves. It's a very  very strong force. I call this entire thing    us humans as our technology  everything that we've made  gadgets in our lives    we call that the technium. That's this world. My working definition of technology is  anything useful that a human mind makes.  It's not just hammers and gadgets  like laptops. But it's also law. And of course cities are ways to make things more useful to us. While this is something that comes from our mind  it also has its roots deeply into the cosmos. It goes back. The origins and roots of technology go back to the Big Bang  in this way  in that they are part of this self organizing thread that starts at the Big Bang and goes through galaxies and stars  into life  into us. And the three major phases of the early universe was energy  when the dominant force was energy  then it became  the dominant force  as it cooled  became matter  and then  with the invention of life  four billion years ago  the dominant force in our neighborhood became information. That's what life is  It's an information process that was restructuring and making new order. So  those energy  matter Einstein show were equivalent  and now new sciences of quantum computing show that entropy and information and matter and energy are all interrelated  so it's one long continuum. You put energy into the right kind of system and out comes wasted heat  entropy and extropy  which is order. It's the increased order. Where does this order come from  Its roots go way back. We actually don't know. But we do know that the self organization trend throughout the universe is long  and it began with things like galaxies  they maintained their order for billions of years. Stars are basically nuclear fusion machines that self organize and self sustain themselves for billions of years  this order against the entropy of the world. And flowers and plants are the same thing  extended  and technology is basically an extension of life. One trend that we notice in all those things is that the amount of energy per gram per second that flows through this  is actually increasing. The amount of energy is increasing through this little sequence. And that the amount of energy per gram per second that flows through life is actually greater than a star    because of the star's long lifespan  the energy density in life is actually higher than a star. And the energy density that we see in the greatest of anywhere in the universe is actually in a PC chip. There is more energy flowing through  per gram per second  than anything that we have any other experience with. What I would suggest is that if you want to see where technology is going  we continue that trajectory  and we say  Well what's going to become more energy dense  that's where it's going.  And so what I've done is  I've taken the same kinds of things and looked at other aspects of evolutionary life and say   What are the general trends in evolutionary life   And there are things moving towards greater complexity  moving towards greater diversity  moving towards greater specialization  sentience  ubiquity and most important  evolvability  Those very same things are also present in technology. That's where technology is going. In fact  technology is accelerating all the aspects of life  and we can see that happening  just as there's diversity in life  there's more diversity in things we make. Things in life start out being general cell  and they become specialized  You have tissue cells  you have muscle  brain cells. And same things happens with say  a hammer  which is general at first and becomes more specific. So  I would like to say that while there is six kingdoms of life  we can think of technology basically as a seventh kingdom of life. It's a branching off from the human form. But technology has its own agenda  like anything  like life itself. For instance  right now  three quarters of the energy that we use is actually used to feed the technium itself. In transportation  it's not to move us  it's to move the stuff that we make or buy. I use the word  want.  Technology wants. This is a robot that wants to plug itself in to get more power. Your cat wants more food. A bacterium  which has no consciousness at all  wants to move towards light. It has an urge  and technology has an urge. At the same time  it wants to give us things  and what it gives us is basically progress. You can take all kinds of curves  and they're all pointing up. There's really no dispute about progress  if we discount the cost of that. And that's the thing that bothers most people  is that progress is really real  but we wonder and question  What are the environmental costs of it  I did a survey of a number of species of artifacts in my house  and there's      . Other people have come up with       . When King Henry of England died  he had        things in his house  but that was the entire wealth of England. And with that entire wealth of England  King Henry could not buy any antibiotics  he could not buy refrigeration  he could not buy a trip of a thousand miles. Whereas this rickshaw wale in India could save up and buy antibiotics and he could buy refrigeration. He could buy things that King Henry  in all his wealth  could never buy. That's what progress is about. So  technology is selfish  technology is generous. That conflict  that tension  will be with us forever  that sometimes it wants to do what it wants to do  and sometimes it's going to do things for us. We have confusion about what we should think about a new technology. Right now the default position about when a new technology comes along  is we    people talk about the precautionary principle  which is very common in Europe  which says  basically   Don't do anything. When you meet a new technology  stop  until it can be proven that there's no harm.  I think that really leads nowhere. But a better way is to  what I call proactionary principle  which is  You engage with technology. You try it out. You obviously do what the precautionary principle suggests  you try to anticipate it  but after anticipating it  you constantly asses it  not just once  but eternally. And when it diverts from what you want  we prioritize risk  we evaluate not just the new stuff  but the old stuff. We fix it  but most importantly  we relocate it. And what I mean by that is that we find a new job for it. Nuclear energy  fission  is really bad idea for bombs. But it may be a pretty good idea relocated into sustainable nuclear energy for electricity  instead of burning coal. When we have a bad idea  the response to a bad idea is not no ideas  it's not to stop thinking. The response to a bad idea    like  say  a tungsten light bulb    is a better idea. OK  So  better ideas is really    always the response to technology that we don't like is basically  better technology. And actually  in a certain sense  technology is a kind of a method for generating better ideas  if you can think about it that way. So  maybe spraying DDT on crops is a really bad idea. But DDT sprayed on local homes  there's nothing better to eliminate malaria  besides insect DDT impregnated mosquito nets. But that's a really good idea  that's a good job for technology. So  our job as humans is to parent our mind children  to find them good friends  to find them a good job. And so  every technology is sort of a creative force looking for the right job. That's actually my son  right here. There are no bad technologies  just as there are no bad children. We don't say children are neutral  children are positive. We just have to find them the right place. And so  what technology gives us  over the long term  over the sort of extended evolution    from the beginning of time  through the invention of the plants and animals  and the evolution of life  the evolution of brains    what that is constantly giving us is increasing differences  It's increasing diversity  it's increasing options  it's increasing choices  opportunities  possibilities and freedoms. That's what we get from technology all the time. That's why people leave villages and go into cities  is because they are always gravitating towards increased choices and possibilities. And we are aware of the price. We pay a price for that  but we are aware of it  and generally we will pay the price for increased freedoms  choices and opportunities. Even technology wants clean water. Is technology diametrically opposed to nature  Because technology is an extension of life  it's in parallel and aligned with the same things that life wants. So that I think technology loves biology  if we allow it to. Great movement that is starting billions of years ago is moving through us and it continues to go  and our choice  so to speak  in technology  is really to align ourselves with this force much greater than ourselves. So  technology is more than just the stuff in your pocket. It's more than just gadgets  it's more than just things that people invent. It's actually part of a very long story  a great story  that began billions of years ago. And it's moving through us  this self organization  and we're extending and accelerating it  and we can be part of it by aligning the technology that we make with it. I really appreciate your attention today. Thank you. I've always been interested in the relationship of formal structures and human behavior. If you build a wide road out to the outskirts of town  people will move there. Well  law is also a powerful driver of human behavior. And what I'd like to discuss today is the need to overhaul and simplify the law to release the energy and passion of Americans  so that we can begin to address the challenges of our society. You might have noticed that law has grown progressively denser in your lives over the last decade or two. If you run a business  it's hard to do much of anything without calling your general counsel. Indeed  there is this phenomenon now where the general counsels are becoming the CEOs. It's a little bit like the Invasion Of The Body Snatchers. You need a lawyer to run the company  because there's so much law. But it's not just business that's affected by this  it's actually pressed down into the daily activities of ordinary people. A couple of years ago I was hiking near Cody  Wyoming. It was in a grizzly bear preserve  although no one told me that before we went. And our guide was a local science teacher. She was wholly unconcerned about the bears  but she was terrified of lawyers. The stories started pouring out. She'd just been involved in an episode where a parent had threatened to sue the school because she lowered the grade of the student by    percent when he turned the paper in late. The principal didn't want to stand up to the parent because he didn't want to get dragged into some legal proceedings. So  she had to go to meeting after meeting  same arguments made over and over again. After    days of sleepless nights  she finally capitulated and raised the grade. She said   Life's too short  I just can't keep going with this.  About the same time  she was going to take two students to a leadership conference in Laramie  which is a couple of hours away  and she was going to drive them in her car  but the school said   No  you can't drive them in the car for liability reasons. You have to go in a school bus.  So  they provided a bus that held    people and drove the three of them back and forth several hours to Laramie. Her husband is also a science teacher  and he takes his biology class on a hike in the nearby national park. But he was told he couldn't go on the hike this year because one of the students in the class was disabled  so the other    students didn't get to go on the hike either. At the end of this day I could have filled a book just with stories about law from this one teacher. Now  we've been taught to believe that law is the foundation of freedom. But somehow or another  in the last couple of decades  the land of the free has become a legal minefield. It's really changed our lives in ways that are sort of imperceptible  and yet  when you pull back  you see it all the time. It's changed the way we talk. I was talking to a pediatrician friend in North Carolina. He said   Well you know  I don't deal with patients the same way anymore. You wouldn't want to say something off the cuff that might be used against you.  This is a doctor  whose life is caring for people. My own law firm has a list of questions that I'm not allowed to ask when interviewing candidates  such as the sinister question  bulging with hidden motives and innuendo   Where are you from   Now for    years  tort reformers have been sounding the alarm that lawsuits are out of control. And we read every once in while about these crazy lawsuits  like the guy in the District of Columbia who sued his dry cleaners for    million dollars because they lost his pair of pants. The case went on for two years  I think he's still appealing the case. But the reality is  these crazy cases are relatively rare. They don't usually win. And the total of direct tort cost in this country is about two percent  which is twice as much as in other countries but  as taxes go  hardly crippling. But the direct costs are really only the tip of the iceberg. What's happened here  again  almost without our knowing  is our culture has changed. People no longer feel free to act on their best judgment. So  what do we do about it  We certainly don't want to give up the rights  when people do something wrong  to seek redress in the courts. We need regulation to make sure people don't pollute and such. We lack even a vocabulary to deal with this problem  and that's because we have the wrong frame of reference. We've been trained to think that the way to look at every dispute  every issue  is a matter of kind of individual rights. And so we peer through a legal microscope  and look at everything. Is it possible that there are extenuating circumstances that explain why Johnny turned his paper in late in Cody  Wyoming  Is it possible that the doctor might have done something differently when the sick person gets sicker  And of course the hindsight bias is perfect. There's always a different scenario that you can sketch out where it's possible that something could have been done differently. And yet  we've been trained to squint into this legal microscope  hoping that we can judge any dispute against the standard of a perfect society  where everyone will agree what's fair  and where accidents will be extinct  risk will be no more. Of course  this is Utopia  it's a formula for paralysis  not freedom. It's not the basis of the rule of law  it's not the basis of a free society. So  now I have the first of four propositions I'm going to leave with you about how you simplify the law  You've got to judge law mainly by its effect on the broader society  not individual disputes. Absolutely vital. So  let's pull back from the anecdotes for a second and look at our society from high above. Is it working  What does the macro data show us  Well  the healthcare system has been transformed  a culture pervaded with defensiveness  universal distrust of the system of justice  universal practice of defensive medicine. It's very hard to measure because there are mixed motives. Doctors can make more on ordering tests sometimes  and also they no longer even know what's right or wrong. But reliable estimates range between    billion and     billion dollars per year. That's enough to provide care to all the people in America who don't have it. The trial lawyers say   Well  this legal fear makes doctors practice better medicine.  Well that's been studied too  by the Institute of Medicine and others. Turns out that's not the case. The fear has chilled professional interaction so thousands of tragic errors occur because doctors are afraid to speak up   Are you sure that's the right dosage   Because they're not sure  and they don't want to take legal responsibility. Let's go to schools. As we saw with the teacher in Cody  Wyoming  she seems to be affected by the law. Well it turns out the schools are literally drowning in law. You could have a separate section of a law library around each of the following legal concepts  due process  special education  no child left behind  zero tolerance  work rules ... it goes on. We did a study of all the rules that affect one school in New York. The Board of Ed. had no idea. Tens of thousands of discreet rules     steps to suspend a student from school  It's a formula for paralysis. What's the effect of that  One is a decline in order. Again  studies have shown it's directly attributable to the rise of due process. Public agenda did a survey for us a couple of years ago where they found that    percent of the high school teachers in America say that they spend at least half of their time maintaining order in the classroom. That means those students are getting half the learning they're supposed to  because if one child is disrupting the class no one can learn. And what happens when the teacher tries to assert order  They're threatened with a legal claim. We also surveyed that. Seventy eight percent of the middle and high school teachers in America have been threatened by their students with violating their rights  with lawsuits by their students. They are threatening  their students. It's not that they usually sue  it's not that they would win  but it's an indication of the corrosion of authority. And how has this system of law worked for government  It doesn't seem to be working very well does it  Neither in Sacramento nor in Washington. The other day at the State of the Union speech  President Obama said  and I think we could all agree with this goal   From the first railroads to the interstate highway system  our nation has always been the first to compete. There is no reason Europe or China should have the fastest trains.  Well  actually there is a reason  Environmental review has evolved into a process of no pebble left unturned for any major project taking the better part of a decade  then followed by years of litigation by anybody who doesn't like the project. Then  just staying above the Earth for one more second  people are acting like idiots  all across the country. Idiots. A couple of years ago  Broward County  Florida  banned running at recess. That means all the boys are going to be ADD. I mean it's just absolutely a formula for failure. My favorite  though  are all the warning labels.  Caution  Contents are hot   on billions of coffee cups. Archeologists will dig us up in a thousand years and they won't know about defensive medicine and stuff  but they'll see all these labels   Contents are extremely hot.  They'll think it was some kind of aphrodisiac. That's the only explanation. Because why would you have to tell people that something was actually hot  My favorite warning was one on a five inch fishing lure. I grew up in the South and whiled away the summers fishing. Five inch fishing lure  it's a big fishing lure  with a three pronged hook in the back  and outside it said   Harmful if swallowed.  So  none of these people are doing what they think is right. And why not  They don't trust the law. Why don't they trust the law  Because it gives us the worst of both worlds  It's random    anybody can sue for almost anything and take it to a jury  not even an effort at consistency    and it's also too detailed. In the areas that are regulated  there are so many rules no human could possibly know it. Well how do you fix it  We could spend        lifetimes trying to prune this legal jungle. But the challenge here is not one of just amending the law  because the hurdle for success is trust. People    for law to be the platform for freedom  people have to trust it. So  that's my second proposition  Trust is an essential condition to a free society. Life is complicated enough without legal fear. But law is different than other kinds of uncertainties  because it carries with it the power of state. And so the state can come in. It actually changes the way people think. It's like having a little lawyer on your shoulders all day long  whispering in your ear   Could that go wrong  Might that go wrong   It drives people from the smart part of the brain    that dark  deep well of the subconscious  where instincts and experience  and all the other factors of creativity and good judgment are    it drives us to the thin veneer of conscious logic. Pretty soon the doctor's saying   Well  I doubt if that headache could be a tumor  but who would protect me if it were  So maybe I'll just order the MRI.  Then you've wasted     billion dollars in unnecessary tests. If you make people self conscious about their judgments  studies show you will make them make worse judgments. If you tell the pianist to think about how she's hitting the notes when she's playing the piece  she can't play the piece. Self consciousness is the enemy of accomplishment. Edison stated it best. He said   Hell  we ain't got no rules around here  we're trying to accomplish something.  So  how do you restore trust  Tweaking the law's clearly not good enough  and tort reform  which is a great idea  lowers your cost if you're a businessperson  but it's like a Band Aid on this gaping wound of distrust. States with extensive tort reform still suffer all these pathologies. So  what's needed is not just to limit claims  but actually create a dry ground of freedom. It turns out that freedom actually has a formal structure. And it is this  Law sets boundaries  and on one side of those boundaries are all the things you can't do or must do    you can't steal  you've got to pay your taxes    but those same boundaries are supposed to define and protect a dry ground of freedom. Isaiah Berlin put it this way   Law sets frontiers  not artificially drawn  within which men shall be inviolable.  We've forgotten that second part. Those dikes have burst. People wade through law all day long. So  what's needed now is to rebuild these boundaries. And it's especially important to rebuild them for lawsuits. Because what people can sue for establishes the boundaries for everybody else's freedom. If someone brings a lawsuit over   A kid fell off the seesaw   it doesn't matter what happens in the lawsuit  all the seesaws will disappear. Because no one will want to take the risk of a lawsuit. And that's what's happened. There are no seesaws  jungle gyms  merry go rounds  climbing ropes  nothing that would interest a kid over the age of four  because there's no risk associated with it. So  how do we rebuild it  Life is too complex for... Life is too complex for a software program. All these choices involve value judgments and social norms  not objective facts. And so here is the fourth proposition. This is what we have  the philosophy we have to change to. And there are two essential elements of it  We have to simplify the law. We have to migrate from all this complexity towards general principles and goals. The constitution is only    pages long. Worked pretty well for     years. Law has to be simple enough so that people can internalize it in their daily choices. If they can't internalize it  they won't trust it. And how do you make it simple  Because life is complex  and here is the hardest and biggest change  We have to restore the authority to judges and officials to interpret and apply the law. We have to rehumanize the law. To make law simple so that you feel free  the people in charge have to be free to use their judgment to interpret and apply the law in accord with reasonable social norms. As you're going down  and walking down the sidewalk during the day  you have to think that if there is a dispute  there's somebody in society who sees it as their job to affirmatively protect you if you're acting reasonably. That person doesn't exist today. This is the hardest hurdle. It's actually not very hard. Ninety eight percent of cases  this is a piece of cake. Maybe you've got a claim in small claims court for your lost pair of pants for       but not in a court of general jurisdiction for millions of dollars. Case dismissed without prejudice or refiling in small claims court. Takes five minutes. That's it  it's not that hard. But it's a hard hurdle because we got into this legal quicksand because we woke up in the     s to all these really bad values  racism  gender discrimination  pollution    they were bad values. And we wanted to create a legal system where no one could have bad values anymore. The problem is  we created a system where we eliminated the right to have good values. It doesn't mean that people in authority can do whatever they want. They're still bounded by legal goals and principles  The teacher is accountable to the principal  the judge is accountable to an appellate court  the president is accountable to voters. But the accountability's up the line judging the decision against the effect on everybody  not just on the disgruntled person. You can't run a society by the lowest common denominator. So  what's needed is a basic shift in philosophy. We can pull the plug on a lot of this stuff if we shift our philosophy. We've been taught that authority is the enemy of freedom. It's not true. Authority  in fact  is essential to freedom. Law is a human institution  responsibility is a human institution. If teachers don't have authority to run the classroom  to maintain order  everybody's learning suffers. If the judge doesn't have the authority to toss out unreasonable claims  then all of us go through the day looking over our shoulders. If the environmental agency can't decide that the power lines are good for the environment  then there's no way to bring the power from the wind farms to the city. A free society requires red lights and green lights  otherwise it soon descends into gridlock. That's what's happened to America. Look around. What the world needs now is to restore the authority to make common choices. It's the only way to get our freedom back  and it's the only way to release the energy and passion needed so that we can meet the challenges of our time. Thank you. Does anybody know when the stethoscope was invented  Any guesses      . And what I can say is  in       doctors aren't going to be walking around with stethoscopes. There's a whole lot better technology coming  and that's part of the change in medicine. What has changed our society has been wireless devices. But the future are digital medical wireless devices  OK  So  let me give you some examples of this to kind of make this much more concrete. This is the first one. This is an electrocardiogram. And  as a cardiologist  to think that you could see in real time a patient  an individual  anywhere in the world on your smartphone  watching your rhythm    that's incredible  and it's with us today. But that's just the beginning. You check your email while you're sitting here. In the future you're going to be checking all your vital signs  all your vital signs  your heart rhythm  your blood pressure  your oxygen  your temperature  etc. This is already available today. This is AirStrip Technologies. It's now wired    or I should say  wireless    by taking the aggregate of these signals in the hospital  in the intensive care unit  and putting it on a smartphone for physicians. If you're an expectant parent  what about the ability to monitor  continuously  fetal heart rate  or intrauterine contractions  and not having to worry so much that things are fine as the pregnancy  and moving over into the time of delivery  And then as we go further  today we have continuous glucose sensors. Right now  they are under the skin  but in the future  they won't have to be implanted. And of course  the desired range    trying to keep glucose between    and less than      checking it every five minutes in a continuous glucose sensor    you'll see how that can impact diabetes. And what about sleep  We're going to zoom in on that a little bit. We're supposed to spend a third of our life in sleep. What if  on your phone  which will be available in the next few weeks  you had every minute of your sleep displayed  And this is  of course  as you can see  the awake is the orange. The REM sleep  rapid eye movement  dream state  is in light green  and light is gray  light sleep  and deep sleep  the best restorative sleep  is that dark green. How about counting every calorie  And this is ability  in real time  to actually take measurements of caloric intake as well as expenditure  through a Band Aid. Now  what I've talked about are physiologic metrics. But what I want to get to  the next frontier  very quickly  and why the stethoscope is on its way out  is because we can transcend listening to the valve sounds  and the breath sounds  because now  introduced by G.E. is a handheld ultra sound. Why is this important  Because this is so much more sensitive. Here is an example of an abdominal ultrasound  and also a cardiac echo  which can be sent wireless  and then there's an example of fetal monitoring on your smartphone. So  we're not just talking about physiologic metrics    the key measurements of vital signs  and all those things in physiology    but also all the imaging that one could look at in your smartphone. Now  this is an example of another obsolete technology  soon to be buried  the Holter Monitor. Twenty four hour recording  lots of wires. This is now a little tiny patch. You can put it on for two weeks and send it in the mail. Now  how does this work  Well  there is these smart Band Aids or these sensors that one would put on  on a shoe or on the wrist. And this sends a signal and it creates a body area network to a gateway. Gateway could be a smartphone or it could be a dedicated gateway  as today many of these things are dedicated gateways  because they are not so well integrated. That signal goes to the web  the cloud  and then it can be processed and sent anywhere  to a caregiver  to a physician  back to the patient  etc. So  that's basically very simplistic technology of how this works. Now  I have this device on. I didn't want to take my shirt off to show you  but I can tell you it's on. This is a device that not only measures cardiac rhythm  as you saw already  but it also goes well beyond that. This is me now. And you can see the ECG. Below that's the actual heart rate and the trend  to the right of that is a bioconductant. That's the fluid status  fluid status  that's really important if you're monitoring somebody with heart failure. And below that's temperature  and respiration  and oxygen  and then the position activity. So  this is really striking  because this device measures seven things that are very much vital signs for monitoring someone with heart failure. OK  And why is this important  Well  this is the most expensive bed. What if we could reduce the need for hospital beds  Well  we can. First of all  heart failure is the number one reason for hospital admissions and readmissions in this country. The cost of heart failure is    billion dollars a year  which is    percent related to hospitalization. And in the course of    days after a hospital stay for a Medicare greater than    years or older  is       percent are readmitted in    days  and by six months  over    percent are readmitted. So  can we improve that  Well the idea is we take this device that I'm wearing  and we put it on     patients with heart failure  randomly assigned  versus     patients who don't have active monitoring  and see whether we can reduce heart failure readmissions  and that's exciting. And we'll start that trial  and you'll hear more about how we're going to do that  but that's a type of wireless device trial that could change medicine in the years ahead. Why now  Why has this all of a sudden become a reality  an exciting direction in the future of medicine  What we have is  in a way  a perfect positive storm. This sets up consumer driven healthcare. That's where this is all starting. Let me just give you specifics about why this is a big movement if you're not aware of it   .  million Americans have gotten a Nike shoe  which is a body area network that connects the shoe  the sole of the shoe to the iPhone  or an iPod. And this Wired Magazine cover article really captured a lot of this  it talked a lot about the Nike shoe and how quickly that's been adopted to monitor exercise physiology and energy expenditure. Here are some things  the principles that are guiding principles to keep in mind   A data driven health revolution promises to make us all better  faster  and stronger. Living by numbers.  And this one  which is really telling  this was from July  this cover article   The personal metrics movement goes way beyond diet and exercise. It's about tracking every facet of life  from sleep to mood to pain          .  Well  I tried this device. A lot of you have gotten that Phillips Direct Life. I didn't have one of those  but I got the Fitbit. That looks like this. It's like a wireless accelerometer  pedometer. And I want to just give you the results of that testing  because I wanted to understand about the consumer movement. I hope the  by the way  the Phillips Direct Life works better    I hope so. But this monitors food  it monitors activity and tracks weight. However you have to put in most of this stuff. The only thing it really tracks by itself is activity  and even then  it's not complete. So  you exercise and it picks up the exercise. You put in your height and weight  it calculates BMI  and of course it tells you how many calories you're expending from the exercise  and how many you took in  if you go in and enter all the foods. But it really wants you to enter all your activity. And so I went to this  and of course I was gratified that it picked up the    minutes of exercise  elliptical exercise I did  but then it wants more information. So  it says   You want to log sexual activity. How long did you do it for   And it says   How hard was it   Furthermore it says   Start time.  Now  this doesn't appear    this just doesn't work  I mean  this just doesn't work. So  now I want to move to sleep. Who would ever have thought you could have your own EEG at your home  tagged to a very nice alarm clock  by the way  This is the headband that goes with this alarm clock. It monitors your brainwaves continuously  when you're sleeping. So  I did this thing for seven days getting ready for TEDMed. This is an important part of our life  one third you're supposed to be sleeping. Of course how many here have any problems with sleeping  It's usually    percent. So  you tell me you sleep better than expected. Okay  well this was a week of my life in sleeping  and you get a Z.Q. score. Instead of an I.Q. score  you get a Z.Q. score when you wake up. You say   Oh  OK.  And a Z.Q. score is adjusted to age  and you want to get as high as you possibly can. So this is the moment by moment  or minute by minute sleep. And you see that Z.Q. there was    odd. And the wake time is in orange. And this can be a problem  as I learned. Because it not only helps you with quantifying your sleep  but also tells others you're awake. So  when my wife came in and she could tell you're awake.  Eric  I want to talk. I want to talk.  And I'm trying to play possum. This thing is very  very impressive. OK. So  that's the first night. And this one is now     and that's not a good score. And this tells you  of course  how much you had in REM sleep  in deep sleep  and all this sort of thing. This was really fascinating because this gave that quantitation about all the different phases of sleep. So  it also then tells you how you do compared to your age group. It's like a managed competition of sleep. And really interesting stuff. Look at this thing and say   Well  I didn't think I was a very good sleeper  but actually I did better than average in    to    year olds.  OK  And the key thing was  what I didn't know  was that I was a really good dreamer. OK. Now let's move from sleep to diseases. Eighty percent of Americans have chronic disease  or    percent of age greater than    have two or more chronic disease      million Americans have one or more chronic disease  and    percent of our  .   whatever  trillion expenditures are related to chronic disease. Now  diabetes is one of the big ones. Almost    million people have diabetes. And here is the latest map. It was published just a little more than a week ago in the New York Times  and it isn't looking good. That is  for men     percent in the country over    have Type II diabetes  and women  although it's less  it's terribly high. But of course we have a way to measure that now on a continuous basis  with a sensor that detects blood glucose  and it's important because we could detect hyperglycemia that otherwise wouldn't be known  and also hypoglycemia. And you can see the red dots  in this particular patient's case  were finger sticks  which would have missed both ends. But by continuous monitoring  it captures all that vital information. The future of this though  is being able to move this to a Band Aid type phenomenon  and that's not so far away. So  let me just give you  very quickly     top targets for wireless medicine. All these things are possible    some of them are very close  or already  as you heard  are available today  in some way or form. Alzheimer's disease  there's five million people affected  and you can check vital signs  activity  balance. Asthma  large number  we could detect things like pollen count  air quality  respiratory rate. Breast cancer  I'll show you an example of that real quickly. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Depression  there's a great approach to that in mood disorders. Diabetes I've just mentioned. Heart failure we already talked about. Hypertension     million people could have continuous blood pressure monitoring to come up with much better management and prevention. And obesity we already talked about  the ways to get to that. And sleep disorders. This is effective around the world. The access to smartphones and cell phones today is extraordinary. And this article from The Economist summed it up beautifully about the opportunities in health across the developing world   Mobile phones made a bigger difference to the lives of more people  more quickly  than any previous technology.  And that's before we got going on the m health world. Aging  The problem is enormous          broken hips per year  but the solutions are extraordinary  and they include so many different things. One of the ones I just wanted to mention  The iShoe is another example of a sensor that improves proprioception among the elderly to prevent falling. One of many different techniques using wireless sensors. So  we can change medicine across the continuum of care  across the ages from premies or unborn children to seniors  the pharmaceutical arena changes  the full spectrum of disease    I hope I've given you a sense of that    across the globe. There are two things that can really accelerate this whole process. One of them    we're very fortunate    is to develop a dedicated institute and that's work that started with the work that Scripps with Qualcomm ... and then the great fortune of meeting up with Gary and Mary West  to get behind this wireless health institute. San Diego is an extraordinary place for this. There's over     wireless companies      of which or more are working in wireless health. It's the number one source of commerce  and interestingly it dovetails beautifully with over     life science companies. The wireless institute  the West Wireless Health Institute  is really the outgrowth of two extraordinary people who are here this evening  Gary and Mary West. And I'd like to give it up for them for getting behind this. Their fantastic philanthropic investment made this possible  and this is really a nonprofit education center which is just about to open. It looks like this  this whole building dedicated. And what it's trying to do is accelerate this era  to take unmet medical needs  to work and innovate    and we just appointed the chief engineer  Mehran Mehregany  it was announced on Monday    then to move up with development  clinical trial validation and then changing medical practice  the most challenging thing of all  requiring attention to reimbursement  healthcare policy  healthcare economics. The other big thing  besides having this fantastic institute to catalyze this process is guidance  and that's of course relying on the fact that medicine goes digital. If we understand biology from genomics and omics and wireless through physiologic phenotyping  that's big. Because what it does is allow a convergence like we've never had before. Over    major diseases have been cracked at the genomic level  but this is quite extraordinary  More has been learned about the underpinnings of disease in the last two and a half years than in the history of man. And when you put that together with  for example  now an app for the iPhone with your genotype to guide drug therapy ... but  the future    we can now tell who's going to get Type II diabetes from all the common variants  and that's going to get filled in more with low frequency variants in the future. We can tell who's going to get breast cancer from the various genes. We can also know who's likely to get atrial fibrillation. And finally  another example  sudden cardiac death. Each of these has a sensor. We can give glucose a sensor for diabetes to prevent it. We can prevent  or have the earliest detection possible  for breast cancer with an ultrasound device given to the patient. An iPatch  iRhythm  for atrial fibrillation. And vital signs monitoring to prevent sudden cardiac death. We lose         people a year in the U.S. from sudden cardiac death. So  I hope I've convinced you of this  of the impact on hospital clinic resources is profound and then the impact on diseases is equally impressive across all these different diseases and more. It's really taking individualized medicine to a new height and it's hyper innovative  and I think it represents the black swan of medicine. Thanks for your attention. I think I'll start out and just talk a little bit about what exactly autism is. Autism is a very big continuum that goes from very severe    the child remains non verbal    all the way up to brilliant scientists and engineers. And I actually feel at home here  because there's a lot of autism genetics here. You wouldn't have any... It's a continuum of traits. When does a nerd turn into Asperger  which is just mild autism  I mean  Einstein and Mozart and Tesla would all be probably diagnosed as autistic spectrum today. And one of the things that is really going to concern me is getting these kids to be the ones that are going to invent the next energy things  you know  that Bill Gates talked about this morning. OK. Now  if you want to understand autism  animals. And I want to talk to you now about different ways of thinking. You have to get away from verbal language. I think in pictures  I don't think in language. Now  the thing about the autistic mind is it attends to details. OK  this is a test where you either have to pick out the big letters  or pick out the little letters  and the autistic mind picks out the little letters more quickly. And the thing is  the normal brain ignores the details. Well  if you're building a bridge  details are pretty important because it will fall down if you ignore the details. And one of my big concerns with a lot of policy things today is things are getting too abstract. People are getting away from doing hands on stuff. I'm really concerned that a lot of the schools have taken out the hands on classes  because art  and classes like that  those are the classes where I excelled. In my work with cattle  I noticed a lot of little things that most people don't notice would make the cattle balk. Like  for example  this flag waving  right in front of the veterinary facility. This feed yard was going to tear down their whole veterinary facility  all they needed to do was move the flag. Rapid movement  contrast. In the early '  s when I started  I got right down in the chutes to see what cattle were seeing. People thought that was crazy. A coat on a fence would make them balk  shadows would make them balk  a hose on the floor ... people weren't noticing these things    a chain hanging down    and that's shown very  very nicely in the movie. In fact  I loved the movie  how they duplicated all my projects. That's the geek side. My drawings got to star in the movie too. And actually it's called  Temple Grandin   not  Thinking In Pictures.  So  what is thinking in pictures  It's literally movies in your head. My mind works like Google for images. Now  when I was a young kid I didn't know my thinking was different. I thought everybody thought in pictures. And then when I did my book   Thinking In Pictures   I start interviewing people about how they think. And I was shocked to find out that my thinking was quite different. Like if I say   Think about a church steeple  most people get this sort of generalized generic one. Now  maybe that's not true in this room  but it's going to be true in a lot of different places. I see only specific pictures. They flash up into my memory  just like Google for pictures. And in the movie  they've got a great scene in there where the word  shoe  is said  and a whole bunch of '  s and '  s shoes pop into my imagination. OK  there is my childhood church  that's specific. There's some more  Fort Collins. OK  how about famous ones  And they just kind of come up  kind of like this. Just really quickly  like Google for pictures. And they come up one at a time  and then I think   OK  well maybe we can have it snow  or we can have a thunderstorm   and I can hold it there and turn them into videos. Now  visual thinking was a tremendous asset in my work designing cattle handling facilities. And I've worked really hard on improving how cattle are treated at the slaughter plant. I'm not going to go into any gucky slaughter slides. I've got that stuff up on YouTube if you want to look at it. But  one of the things that I was able to do in my design work is I could actually test run a piece of equipment in my mind  just like a virtual reality computer system. And this is an aerial view of a recreation of one of my projects that was used in the movie. That was like just so super cool. And there were a lot of kind of Asperger types and autism types working out there on the movie set too. But one of the things that really worries me is  Where's the younger version of those kids going today  They're not ending up in Silicon Valley  where they belong. Now  one of the things I learned very early on because I wasn't that social  is I had to sell my work  and not myself. And the way I sold livestock jobs is I showed off my drawings  I showed off pictures of things. Another thing that helped me as a little kid is  boy  in the '  s  you were taught manners. You were taught you can't pull the merchandise off the shelves in the store and throw it around. Now  when kids get to be in third or fourth grade  you might see that this kid's going to be a visual thinker  drawing in perspective. Now  I want to emphasize that not every autistic kid is going to be a visual thinker. Now  I had this brain scan done several years ago  and I used to joke around about having a gigantic Internet trunk line going deep into my visual cortex. This is tensor imaging. And my great big internet trunk line is twice as big as the control's. The red lines there are me  and the blue lines are the sex and age matched control. And there I got a gigantic one  and the control over there  the blue one  has got a really small one. And some of the research now is showing is that people on the spectrum actually think with primary visual cortex. Now  the thing is  the visual thinker's just one kind of mind. You see  the autistic mind tends to be a specialist mind    good at one thing  bad at something else. And where I was bad was algebra. And I was never allowed to take geometry or trig. Gigantic mistake  I'm finding a lot of kids who need to skip algebra  go right to geometry and trig. Now  another kind of mind is the pattern thinker. More abstract. These are your engineers  your computer programmers. Now  this is pattern thinking. That praying mantis is made from a single sheet of paper    no scotch tape  no cuts. And there in the background is the pattern for folding it. Here are the types of thinking  photo realistic visual thinkers  like me  pattern thinkers  music and math minds. Some of these oftentimes have problems with reading. You also will see these kind of problems with kids that are dyslexic. You'll see these different kinds of minds. And then there's a verbal mind  they know every fact about everything. Now  another thing is the sensory issues. I was really concerned about having to wear this gadget on my face. And I came in half an hour beforehand so I could have it put on and kind of get used to it  and they got it bent so it's not hitting my chin. But sensory is an issue. Some kids are bothered by fluorescent lights  others have problems with sound sensitivity. You know  it's going to be variable. Now  visual thinking gave me a whole lot of insight into the animal mind. Because think about it  An animal is a sensory based thinker  not verbal    thinks in pictures  thinks in sounds  thinks in smells. Think about how much information there is there on the local fire hydrant. He knows who's been there  when they were there. Are they friend or foe  Is there anybody he can go mate with  There's a ton of information on that fire hydrant. It's all very detailed information  and  looking at these kind of details gave me a lot of insight into animals. Now  the animal mind  and also my mind  puts sensory based information into categories. Man on a horse and a man on the ground    that is viewed as two totally different things. You could have a horse that's been abused by a rider. They'll be absolutely fine with the veterinarian and with the horseshoer  but you can't ride him. You have another horse  where maybe the horseshoer beat him up and he'll be terrible for anything on the ground  with the veterinarian  but a person can ride him. Cattle are the same way. Man on a horse  a man on foot    they're two different things. You see  it's a different picture. See  I want you to think about just how specific this is. Now  this ability to put information into categories  I find a lot of people are not very good at this. When I'm out troubleshooting equipment or problems with something in a plant  they don't seem to be able to figure out   Do I have a training people issue  Or do I have something wrong with the equipment   In other words  categorize equipment problem from a people problem. I find a lot of people have difficulty doing that. Now  let's say I figure out it's an equipment problem. Is it a minor problem  with something simple I can fix  Or is the whole design of the system wrong  People have a hard time figuring that out. Let's just look at something like  you know  solving problems with making airlines safer. Yeah  I'm a million mile flier. I do lots and lots of flying  and if I was at the FAA  what would I be doing a lot of direct observation of  It would be their airplane tails. You know  five fatal wrecks in the last    years  the tail either came off or steering stuff inside the tail broke in some way. It's tails  pure and simple. And when the pilots walk around the plane  guess what  They can't see that stuff inside the tail. You know  now as I think about that  I'm pulling up all of that specific information. It's specific. See  my thinking's bottom up. I take all the little pieces and I put the pieces together like a puzzle. Now  here is a horse that was deathly afraid of black cowboy hats. He'd been abused by somebody with a black cowboy hat. White cowboy hats  that was absolutely fine. Now  the thing is  the world is going to need all of the different kinds of minds to work together. We've got to work on developing all these different kinds of minds. And one of the things that is driving me really crazy  as I travel around and I do autism meetings  is I'm seeing a lot of smart  geeky  nerdy kids  and they just aren't very social  and nobody's working on developing their interest in something like science. And this brings up the whole thing of my science teacher. My science teacher is shown absolutely beautifully in the movie. I was a goofball student. When I was in high school I just didn't care at all about studying  until I had Mr. Carlock's science class. He was now Dr. Carlock in the movie. And he got me challenged to figure out an optical illusion room. This brings up the whole thing of you've got to show kids interesting stuff. You know  one of the things that I think maybe TED ought to do is tell all the schools about all the great lectures that are on TED  and there's all kinds of great stuff on the Internet to get these kids turned on. Because I'm seeing a lot of these geeky nerdy kids  and the teachers out in the Midwest  and the other parts of the country  when you get away from these tech areas  they don't know what to do with these kids. And they're not going down the right path. The thing is  you can make a mind to be more of a thinking and cognitive mind  or your mind can be wired to be more social. And what some of the research now has shown in autism is there may by extra wiring back here  in the really brilliant mind  and we lose a few social circuits here. It's kind of a trade off between thinking and social. And then you can get into the point where it's so severe you're going to have a person that's going to be non verbal. In the normal human mind language covers up the visual thinking we share with animals. This is the work of Dr. Bruce Miller. And he studied Alzheimer's patients that had frontal temporal lobe dementia. And the dementia ate out the language parts of the brain  and then this artwork came out of somebody who used to install stereos in cars. Now  Van Gogh doesn't know anything about physics  but I think it's very interesting that there was some work done to show that this eddy pattern in this painting followed a statistical model of turbulence  which brings up the whole interesting idea of maybe some of this mathematical patterns is in our own head. And the Wolfram stuff    I was taking notes and I was writing down all the search words I could use  because I think that's going to go on in my autism lectures. We've got to show these kids interesting stuff. And they've taken out the autoshop class and the drafting class and the art class. I mean art was my best subject in school. We've got to think about all these different kinds of minds  and we've got to absolutely work with these kind of minds  because we absolutely are going to need these kind of people in the future. And let's talk about jobs. OK  my science teacher got me studying because I was a goofball that didn't want to study. But you know what  I was getting work experience. I'm seeing too many of these smart kids who haven't learned basic things  like how to be on time. I was taught that when I was eight years old. You know  how to have table manners at granny's Sunday party. I was taught that when I was very  very young. And when I was     I had a job at a dressmaker's shop sewing clothes. I did internships in college  I was building things  and I also had to learn how to do assignments. You know  all I wanted to do was draw pictures of horses when I was little. My mother said   Well let's do a picture of something else.  They've got to learn how to do something else. Let's say the kid is fixated on Legos. Let's get him working on building different things. The thing about the autistic mind is it tends to be fixated. Like if a kid loves racecars  let's use racecars for math. Let's figure out how long it takes a racecar to go a certain distance. In other words  use that fixation in order to motivate that kid  that's one of the things we need to do. I really get fed up when they  you know  the teachers  especially when you get away from this part of the country  they don't know what to do with these smart kids. It just drives me crazy. What can visual thinkers do when they grow up  They can do graphic design  all kinds of stuff with computers  photography  industrial design. The pattern thinkers  they're the ones that are going to be your mathematicians  your software engineers  your computer programmers  all of those kinds of jobs. And then you've got the word minds. They make great journalists  and they also make really  really good stage actors. Because the thing about being autistic is  I had to learn social skills like being in a play. It's just kind of    you just have to learn it. And we need to be working with these students. And this brings up mentors. You know  my science teacher was not an accredited teacher. He was a NASA space scientist. Now  some states now are getting it to where if you have a degree in biology  or a degree in chemistry  you can come into the school and teach biology or chemistry. We need to be doing that. Because what I'm observing is the good teachers  for a lot of these kids  are out in the community colleges  but we need to be getting some of these good teachers into the high schools. Another thing that can be very  very  very successful is there is a lot of people that may have retired from working in the software industry  and they can teach your kid. And it doesn't matter if what they teach them is old  because what you're doing is you're lighting the spark. You're getting that kid turned on. And you get him turned on  then he'll learn all the new stuff. Mentors are just essential. I cannot emphasize enough what my science teacher did for me. And we've got to mentor them  hire them. And if you bring them in for internships in your companies  the thing about the autism  Asperger y kind of mind  you've got to give them a specific task. Don't just say   Design new software.  You've got to tell them something a lot more specific   Well  we're designing a software for a phone and it has to do some specific thing. And it can only use so much memory.  That's the kind of specificity you need. Well  that's the end of my talk. And I just want to thank everybody for coming. It was great to be here. Oh  you've got a question for me  OK. Chris Anderson  Thank you so much for that. You know  you once wrote  I like this quote   If by some magic  autism had been eradicated from the face of the Earth  then men would still be socializing in front of a wood fire at the entrance to a cave.  Temple Grandin  Because who do you think made the first stone spears  The Asperger guy. And if you were to get rid of all the autism genetics there would be no more Silicon Valley  and the energy crisis would not be solved. CA  So  I want to ask you a couple other questions  and if any of these feel inappropriate  it's okay just to say   Next question.  But if there is someone here who has an autistic child  or knows an autistic child and feels kind of cut off from them  what advice would you give them  TG  Well  first of all  you've got to look at age. If you have a two  three or four year old you know  no speech  no social interaction  I can't emphasize enough  Don't wait  you need at least    hours a week of one to one teaching. You know  the thing is  autism comes in different degrees. There's going to be about half the people on the spectrum that are not going to learn to talk  and they're not going to be working Silicon Valley  that would not be a reasonable thing for them to do. But then you get the smart  geeky kids that have a touch of autism  and that's where you've got to get them turned on with doing interesting things. I got social interaction through shared interest. I rode horses with other kids  I made model rockets with other kids  did electronics lab with other kids  and in the '  s  it was gluing mirrors onto a rubber membrane on a speaker to make a light show. That was like  we considered that super cool. CA  Is it unrealistic for them to hope or think that that child loves them  as some might  as most  wish  TG  Well let me tell you  that child will be loyal  and if your house is burning down  they're going to get you out of it. CA  Wow. So  most people  if you ask them what are they most passionate about  they'd say things like   My kids  or  My lover.  What are you most passionate about  TG  I'm passionate about that the things I do are going to make the world a better place. When I have a mother of an autistic child say   My kid went to college because of your book  or one of your lectures   that makes me happy. You know  the slaughter plants  I've worked with them in the '  s  they were absolutely awful. I developed a really simple scoring system for slaughter plants where you just measure outcomes  How many cattle fell down  How many cattle got poked with the prodder  How many cattle are mooing their heads off  And it's very  very simple. You directly observe a few simple things. It's worked really well. I get satisfaction out of seeing stuff that makes real change in the real world. We need a lot more of that  and a lot less abstract stuff. CA  When we were talking on the phone  one of the things you said that really astonished me was you said one thing you were passionate about was server farms. Tell me about that. TG  Well the reason why I got really excited when I read about that  it contains knowledge. It's libraries. And to me  knowledge is something that is extremely valuable. So  maybe  over    years ago now our library got flooded. And this is before the Internet got really big. And I was really upset about all the books being wrecked  because it was knowledge being destroyed. And server farms  or data centers are great libraries of knowledge. CA  Temple  can I just say it's an absolute delight to have you at TED. TG  Well thank you so much. Thank you. If you are a blind child in India  you will very likely have to contend with at least two big pieces of bad news. The first bad news is that the chances of getting treatment are extremely slim to none  and that's because most of the blindness alleviation programs in the country are focused on adults  and there are very  very few hospitals that are actually equipped to treat children. In fact  if you were to be treated  you might well end up being treated by a person who has no medical credentials as this case from Rajasthan illustrates. This is a three year old orphan girl who had cataracts. So  her caretakers took her to the village medicine man  and instead of suggesting to the caretakers that the girl be taken to a hospital  the person decided to burn her abdomen with red hot iron bars to drive out the demons. The second piece of bad news will be delivered to you by neuroscientists  who will tell you that if you are older than four or five years of age  that even if you have your eye corrected  the chances of your brain learning how to see are very  very slim    again  slim or none. So when I heard these two things  it troubled me deeply  both because of personal reasons and scientific reasons. So let me first start with the personal reason. It'll sound corny  but it's sincere. That's my son  Darius. As a new father  I have a qualitatively different sense of just how delicate babies are  what our obligations are towards them and how much love we can feel towards a child. I would move heaven and earth in order to get treatment for Darius  and for me to be told that there might be other Dariuses who are not getting treatment  that's just viscerally wrong. So that's the personal reason. Scientific reason is that this notion from neuroscience of critical periods    that if the brain is older than four or five years of age  it loses its ability to learn    that doesn't sit well with me  because I don't think that idea has been tested adequately. The birth of the idea is from David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel's work  two researchers who were at Harvard  and they got the Nobel Prize in      for their studies of visual physiology  which are remarkably beautiful studies  but I believe some of their work has been extrapolated into the human domain prematurely. So  they did their work with kittens  with different kinds of deprivation regiments  and those studies  which date back to the '  s  are now being applied to human children. So I felt that I needed to do two things. One  provide care to children who are currently being deprived of treatment. That's the humanitarian mission. And the scientific mission would be to test the limits of visual plasticity. And these two missions  as you can tell  thread together perfectly. One adds to the other  in fact  one would be impossible without the other. So  to implement these twin missions  a few years ago  I launched Project Prakash. Prakash  as many of you know  is the Sanskrit word for light  and the idea is that in bringing light into the lives of children  we also have a chance of shedding light on some of the deepest mysteries of neuroscience. And the logo    even though it looks extremely Irish  it's actually derived from the Indian symbol of Diya  an earthen lamp. The Prakash  the overall effort has three components  outreach  to identify children in need of care  medical treatment  and in subsequent study. And I want to show you a short video clip that illustrates the first two components of this work. This is an outreach station conducted at a school for the blind. Pawan Sinha  So  because this is a school for the blind  many children have permanent conditions. That's a case of microphthalmos  which is malformed eyes  and that's a permanent condition  it cannot be treated. That's an extreme of micropthalmos called enophthalmos. But  every so often  we come across children who show some residual vision  and that is a very good sign that the condition might actually be treatable. So  after that screening  we bring the children to the hospital. That's the hospital we're working with in Delhi  the Schroff Charity Eye Hospital. It has a very well equipped pediatric ophthalmic center  which was made possible in part by a gift from the Ronald McDonald charity. So  eating burgers actually helps. eye health in many children  and ... ... help us find children who can participate in Project Prakash.  PS  So  as I zoom in to the eyes of this child  you will see the cause of his blindness. The whites that you see in the middle of his pupils are congenital cataracts  so opacities of the lens. In our eyes  the lens is clear  but in this child  the lens has become opaque  and therefore he can't see the world. So  the child is given treatment. You'll see shots of the eye. Here's the eye with the opaque lens  the opaque lens extracted and an acrylic lens inserted. And here's the same child three weeks post operation  with the right eye open. Thank you. So  even from that little clip  you can begin to get the sense that recovery is possible  and we have now provided treatment to over     children  and the story repeats itself. After treatment  the child gains significant functionality. In fact  the story holds true even if you have a person who got sight after several years of deprivation. We did a paper a few years ago about this woman that you see on the right  SRD  and she got her sight late in life  and her vision is remarkable at this age. I should add a tragic postscript to this    she died two years ago in a bus accident. So  hers is just a truly inspiring story    unknown  but inspiring story. So when we started finding these results  as you might imagine  it created quite a bit of stir in the scientific and the popular press. Here's an article in Nature that profiled this work  and another one in Time. So  we were fairly convinced    we are convinced    that recovery is feasible  despite extended visual deprivation. The next obvious question to ask  What is the process of recovery  So  the way we study that is  let's say we find a child who has light sensitivity. The child is provided treatment  and I want to stress that the treatment is completely unconditional  there is no quid pro quo. We treat many more children then we actually work with. Every child who needs treatment is treated. After treatment  about every week  we run the child on a battery of simple visual tests in order to see how their visual skills are coming on line. And we try to do this for as long as possible. This arc of development gives us unprecedented and extremely valuable information about how the scaffolding of vision gets set up. What might be the causal connections between the early developing skills and the later developing ones  And we've used this general approach to study many different visual proficiencies  but I want to highlight one particular one  and that is image parsing into objects. So  any image of the kind that you see on the left  be it a real image or a synthetic image  it's made up of little regions that you see in the middle column  regions of different colors  different luminances. The brain has this complex task of putting together  integrating  subsets of these regions into something that's more meaningful  into what we would consider to be objects  as you see on the right. And nobody knows how this integration happens  and that's the question we asked with Project Prakash. So  here's what happens very soon after the onset of sight. Here's a person who had gained sight just a couple of weeks ago  and you see Ethan Myers  a graduate student from MIT  running the experiment with him. His visual motor coordination is quite poor  but you get a general sense of what are the regions that he's trying to trace out. If you show him real world images  if you show others like him real world images  they are unable to recognize most of the objects because the world to them is over fragmented  it's made up of a collage  a patchwork  of regions of different colors and luminances. And that's what's indicated in the green outlines. When you ask them   Even if you can't name the objects  just point to where the objects are   these are the regions that they point to. So the world is this complex patchwork of regions. Even the shadow on the ball becomes its own object. Interestingly enough  you give them a few months  and this is what happens. Doctor  How many are these  Patient  These are two things. Doctor  What are their shapes  Patient  Their shapes ... This one is a circle  and this is a square. PS  A very dramatic transformation has come about. And the question is  What underlies this transformation  It's a profound question  and what's even more amazing is how simple the answer is. The answer lies in motion and that's what I want to show you in the next clip. Doctor  What shape do you see here  Patient  I can't make it out. Doctor  Now  Patient  Triangle. Doctor  How many things are these  Now  how many things are these  Patient  Two. Doctor  What are these things  Patient  A square and a circle. PS  And we see this pattern over and over again. The one thing the visual system needs in order to begin parsing the world is dynamic information. So the inference we are deriving from this  and several such experiments  is that dynamic information processing  or motion processing  serves as the bedrock for building the rest of the complexity of visual processing  it leads to visual integration and eventually to recognition. This simple idea has far reaching implications. And let me just quickly mention two  one  drawing from the domain of engineering  and one from the clinic. So  from the perspective of engineering  we can ask  Goven that we know that motion is so important for the human visual system  can we use this as a recipe for constructing machine based vision systems that can learn on their own  that don't need to be programmed by a human programmer  And that's what we're trying to do. I'm at MIT  at MIT you need to apply whatever basic knowledge you gain. So we are creating Dylan  which is a computational system with an ambitious goal of taking in visual inputs of the same kind that a human child would receive  and autonomously discovering  What are the objects in this visual input  So  don't worry about the internals of Dylan. Here  I'm just going to talk about how we test Dylan. The way we test Dylan is by giving it inputs  as I said  of the same kind that a baby  or a child in Project Prakash would get. But for a long time we couldn't quite figure out  Wow can we get these kinds of video inputs  So  I thought  could we have Darius serve as our babycam carrier  and that way get the inputs that we feed into Dylan  So that's what we did. I had to have long conversations with my wife. In fact  Pam  if you're watching this  please forgive me. So  we modified the optics of the camera in order to mimic the baby's visual acuity. As some of you might know  babyies are born pretty much legally blind. Their acuity    our acuity is        babies' acuity is like         so they are looking at the world in a very  very blurry fashion. Here's what a baby cam video looks like. Thankfully  there isn't any audio to go with this. What's amazing is that working with such highly degraded input  the baby  very quickly  is able to discover meaning in such input. But then two or three days afterward  babies begin to pay attention to their mother's or their father's face. How does that happen  We want Dylan to be able to do that  and using this mantra of motion  Dylan actually can do that. So  given that kind of video input  with just about six or seven minutes worth of video  Dylan can begin to extract patterns that include faces. So  it's an important demonstration of the power of motion. The clinical implication  it comes from the domain of autism. Visual integration has been associated with autism by several researchers. When we saw that  we asked  Could the impairment in visual integration be the manifestation of something underneath  of dynamic information processing deficiencies in autism  Because  if that hypothesis were to be true  it would have massive repercussions in our understanding of what's causing the many different aspects of the autism phenotype. What you're going to see are video clips of two children    one neurotypical  one with autism  playing Pong. So  while the child is playing Pong  we are tracking where they're looking. In red are the eye movement traces. This is the neurotypical child  and what you see is that the child is able to make cues of the dynamic information to predict where the ball is going to go. Even before the ball gets to a place  the child is already looking there. Contrast this with a child with autism playing the same game. Instead of anticipating  the child always follows where the ball has been. The efficiency of the use of dynamic information seems to be significantly compromised in autism. So we are pursuing this line of work and hopefully we'll have more results to report soon. Looking ahead  if you think of this disk as representing all of the children we've treated so far  this is the magnitude of the problem. The red dots are the children we have not treated. So  there are many  many more children who need to be treated  and in order to expand the scope of the project  we are planning on launching The Prakash Center for Children  which will have a dedicated pediatric hospital  a school for the children we are treating and also a cutting edge research facility. The Prakash Center will integrate health care  education and research in a way that truly creates the whole to be greater than the sum of the parts. So  to summarize  Prakash  in its five years of existence  it's had an impact in multiple areas  ranging from basic neuroscience plasticity and learning in the brain  to clinically relevant hypotheses like in autism  the development of autonomous machine vision systems  education of the undergraduate and graduate students  and most importantly in the alleviation of childhood blindness. And for my students and I  it's been just a phenomenal experience because we have gotten to do interesting research  while at the same time helping the many children that we have worked with. Thank you very much. I think it was in my second grade that I was caught drawing the bust of a nude by Michelangelo. I was sent straight away to my school principal  and my school principal  a sweet nun  looked at my book with disgust  flipped through the pages  saw all the nudes    you know  I'd been seeing my mother draw nudes and I'd copy her    and the nun slapped me on my face and said   Sweet Jesus  this kid has already begun.  I had no clue what she was talking about  but it was convincing enough for me never to draw again until the ninth grade. Thanks to a really boring lecture  I started caricaturing my teachers in school. And  you know  I got a lot of popularity. I don't play sports. I'm really bad at sports. I don't have the fanciest gadgets at home. I'm not on top of the class. So for me  cartooning gave me a sense of identity. I got popular  but I was scared I'd get caught again. So what I did was I quickly put together a collage of all the teachers I had drawn  glorified my school principal  put him right on top  and gifted it to him. He had a good laugh at the other teachers and put it up on the notice board. This is a part of that. And I became a school hero. All my seniors knew me. I felt really special. I have to tell you a little bit about my family. That's my mother. I love her to bits. She's the one who taught me how to draw and  more importantly  how to love. She's a bit of a hippie. She said   Don't say that   but I'm saying it anyway. The rest of my family are boring academics  busy collecting Ivy League decals for our classic Ambassador car. My father's a little different. My father believed in a holistic approach to living  and  you know  every time he taught us  he'd say   I hate these books  because these books are hijacked by Industrial Revolution.  While he still held that worldview  I was     I got the best lawyer in town  my older brother Karthik  and I sat him down  and I said   Pa  from today onwards I've decided I'm going to be disciplined  I'm going to be curious  I'm going to learn something new every day  I'm going to be very hard working  and I'm not going to depend on you emotionally or financially.  And he was very impressed. He was all tearing up. Ready to hug me. And I said   Hold that thought.  I said   Can I quit school then   But  to cut a long story short  I quit school to pursue a career as a cartoonist. I must have done about        caricatures. I would do birthday parties  weddings  divorces  anything for anyone who wanted to use my services. But  most importantly  while I was traveling  I taught children cartooning  and in exchange  I learned how to be spontaneous. And mad and crazy and fun. When I started teaching them  I said let me start doing this professionally. When I was    I started my own school. However  an    year old trying to start a school is not easy unless you have a big patron or a big supporter. So I was flipping through the pages of the Times of India when I saw that the Prime Minister of India was visiting my home town  Bangalore. And  you know  just like how every cartoonist knows Bush here  and if you had to meet Bush  it would be the funnest thing because his face was a cartoonist's delight. I had to meet my Prime Minister. I went to the place where his helicopter was about to land. I saw layers of security. I caricatured my way through three layers by just impressing the guards  but I got stuck. I got stuck at the third. And what happened was  to my luck  I saw a nuclear scientist at whose party I had done cartoons. I ran up to him  and said   Hello  sir. How do you do   He said   What are you doing here  Raghava   I said   I'm here to meet the Prime Minister.  He said   Oh  so am I.  I hopped into his car  and off we went through the remaining layers of security. Thank you. I sat him down  I caricatured him  and since then I've caricatured hundreds of celebrities. This is one I remember fondly. Salman Rushdie was pissed off I think because I altered the map of New York  if you notice. Anyway  the next slide I'm about to show you    Should I just turn that off  The next slide I'm about to show you  is a little more serious. I was hesitant to include this in my presentation because this cartoon was published soon after     . What was  for me  a very naive observation  turned out to be a disaster. That evening  I came home to hundreds of hate mails  hundreds of people telling me how they could have lived another day without seeing this. I was also asked to leave the organization  a cartoonists' organization in America  that for me was my lifeline. That's when I realized  you know  cartoons are really powerful  art comes with responsibility. Anyway  what I did was I decided that I need to take a break. I quit my job at the papers  I closed my school  and I wrapped up my pencils and my brushes and inks  and I decided to go traveling. When I went traveling  I remember  I met this fabulous old man  who I met when I was caricaturing  who turned out to be an artist  in Italy. He invited me to his studio. He said   Come and visit.  When I went  I saw the ghastliest thing ever. I saw this dead  naked effigy of himself hanging from the ceiling. I said   Oh  my God. What is that   And I asked him  and he said   Oh  that thing  In the night  I die. In the morning  I am born again.  I thought he was koo koo  but something about that really stuck. I loved it. I thought there was something really beautiful about that. So I said   I am dead  so I need to be born again.  So  I wanted to be a painter like him  except  I don't know how to paint. So  I tried going to the art store. You know  there are a hundred types of brushes. Forget it  they will confuse you even if you know how to draw. So I decided  I'm going to learn to paint by myself. I'm going to show you a very quick clip to show you how I painted and a little bit about my city  Bangalore. They had to be larger than life. Everything had to be larger. The next painting was even bigger. And even bigger. And for me it was  I had to dance while I painted. It was so exciting. Except  I even started painting dancers. Here for example is a Flamenco dancer  except there was one problem. I didn't know the dance form  so I started following them  and I made some money  sold my paintings and would rush off to France or Spain and work with them. That's Pepe Linares  the renowned Flamenco singer. But I had one problem  my paintings never danced. As much energy as I put into them while making them  they never danced. So I decided    I had this crazy epiphany at two in the morning. I called my friends  painted on their bodies  and had them dance in front of a painting. And  all of a sudden  my paintings came alive. And then I was fortunate enough to actually perform this in California with Velocity Circus. And I sat like you guys there in the audience. And I saw my work come alive. You know  normally you work in isolation  and you show at a gallery  but here  the work was coming alive  and it had some other artists working with me. The collaborative effort was fabulous. I said  I'm going to collaborate with anybody and everybody I meet. I started doing fashion. This is a fashion show we held in London. The best collaboration  of course  is with children. They are ruthless  they are honest  but they're full of energy and fun. This is a work  a library I designed for the Robin Hood Foundation. And I must say  I spent time in the Bronx working with these kids. And  in exchange for me working with them  they taught me how to be cool. I don't think I've succeeded  but they've taught me. They said   Stop saying sorry. Say  my bad.  Then I said  all this is good  but I want to paint like a real painter. American education is so expensive. I was in India  and I was walking down the streets  and I saw a billboard painter. And these guys paint humongous paintings  and they look really good. And I wondered how they did it from so close. So  one day I had the opportunity to meet one of these guys  and I said   How do you paint like that  Who taught you   And he said   Oh  it's very easy. I can teach you  but we're leaving the city  because billboard painters are a dying  extinct bunch of artists  because digital printing has totally replaced them and hijacked them.  I said  in exchange for education in how to paint  I will support them  and I started a company. And since then  I've been painting all over the place. This is a painting I did of my wife in my apartment. This is another painting. And  in fact  I started painting on anything  and started sending them around town. Since I mentioned my wife  the most important collaboration has been with her  Netra. Netra and I met when she was   . I must have been    and a half then  and it was love at first sight. I lived in India. She lived in America. She'd come every two months to visit me  and then I said I'm the man  I'm the man  and I have to reciprocate. I have to travel seven oceans  and I have to come and see you. I did that twice  and I went broke. So then I said   Nets  what do I do   She said   Why don't you send me your paintings  My dad knows a bunch of rich guys. We'll try and con them into buying it  and then...  But it turned out  after I sent the works to her  that her dad's friends  like most of you  are geeks. I'm joking. No  they were really big geeks  and they didn't know much about art. So Netra was stuck with    paintings of mine. So what we did was we rented a little van and we drove all over the east coast trying to sell it. She contacted anyone and everyone who was willing to buy my work. She made enough money  she sold off the whole collection and made enough money to move me for four years with lawyers  a company  everything  and she became my manager. That's us in New York. Notice one thing  we're equal here. Something happened along the line. But this brought me    with Netra managing my career    it brought me a lot of success. I was really happy. I thought of myself as a bit of a rockstar. I loved the attention. This is all the press we got  and we said  it's time to celebrate. And I said that the best way to celebrate is to marry Netra. I said   Let's get married.  And I said   Not just married. Let's invite everyone who's helped us  all the people who bought our work.  And you won't believe it  we put together a list of       people  who had made a difference    a ridiculous list  but I was determined to bring them to India  so    a lot of them were in India.     artists volunteered to help me with my wedding. We had fashion designers  installation artists  models  we had makeup artists  jewelry designers  all kinds of people working with me to make my wedding an art installation. And I had a special installation in tribute to my in laws. I had the vegetable carvers work on that for me. But all this excitement led to the press writing about us. We were in the papers  we're still in the news three years later  but  unfortunately  something tragic happened right after. My mother fell very ill. I love my mother and I was told all of a sudden that she was going to die. And they said you have to say bye to her  you have to do what you have to do. And I was devastated. I had shows booked up for another year. I was on a high. And I couldn't. I could not. My life was not exuberant. I could not live this larger than life person. I started exploring the darker abscesses of the human mind. Of course  my work turned ugly  but another thing happened. I lost all my audiences. The Bollywood stars who I would party with and buy my work disappeared. The collectors  the friends  the press  everyone said   Nice  but thank you.   No thank you   was more like it. But I wanted people to actually feel my work from their gut  because I was painting it from my gut. If they wanted beauty  I said  this is the beauty I'm willing to give you. It's politicized. Of course  none of them liked it. My works also turned autobiographical. At this point  something else happened. A very  very dear friend of mine came out of the closet  and in India at that time  it was illegal to be gay  and it's disgusting to see how people respond to a gay person. I was very upset. I remember the time when my mother used to dress me up as a little girl    that's me there    because she wanted a girl  and she has only boys. Anyway  I don't know what my friends are going to say after this talk. It's a secret. So  after this  my works turned a little violent. I talked about this masculinity that one need not perform. And I talked about the weakness of male sexuality. This time  not only did my collectors disappear  the political activists decided to ban me and to threaten me and to forbid me from showing. It turned nasty  and I'm a bit of a chicken. I can't deal with any threat. This was a big threat. So  I decided it was time to end and go back home. This time I said let's try something different. I need to be reborn again. And I thought the best way  as most of you know who have children  the best way to have a new lease on life  is to have a child. I decided to have a child  and before I did that  I quickly studied what can go wrong. How can a family get dysfunctional  And Rudra was born. That's my little son. And two magical things happened after he was born. My mother miraculously recovered after a serious operation  and this man was elected president of this country. You know I sat at home and I watched. I teared up and I said that's where I want to be. So Netra and I wound up our life  closed up everything we had  and we decided to move to New York. And this was just eight months ago. I moved back to New York  my work has changed. Everything about my work has become more whimsical. This one is called  What the Fuck Was I Thinking   It talks about mental incest. You know  I may appear to be a very nice  clean  sweet boy. But I'm not. I'm capable of thinking anything. But I'm very civil in my action  I assure you. These are just different cartoons. And  before I go  I want to tell you a little story. I was talking to mother and father this morning  and my dad said   I know you have so much you want to say  but you have to talk about your work with children.  So I said  okay. I work with children all over the world  and that's an entirely different talk  but I want to leave you with one story that really  really inspired me. I met Belinda when she was   . I was   . I was in Australia  and Belinda had cancer  and I was told she's not going to live very long. They  in fact  told me three weeks. I walk into her room  and there was a shy girl  and she was bald  and she was trying to hide her baldness. I whipped out my pen  and I started drawing on her head and I drew a crown for her. And then  we started talking  and we spent a lovely time    I told her how I ended up in Australia  how I backpacked and who I conned  and how I got a ticket  and all the stories. And I drew it out for her. And then I left. Belinda died and within a few days of her death  they published a book for her  and she used my cartoon on the cover. And she wrote a little note  she said   Hey Rags  thank you for the magic carpet ride around the world.  For me  my art is my magic carpet ride. I hope you will join me in this magic carpet ride  and touch children and be honest. Thank you so much. Everybody talks about happiness these days. I had somebody count the number of books with  happiness  in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about     and there were many more. There is a huge wave of interest in happiness  among researchers. There is a lot of happiness coaching. Everybody would like to make people happier. But in spite of all this flood of work  there are several cognitive traps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness. And my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps. This applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness  and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness  because it turns out we're just as messed up as anybody else is. The first of these traps is a reluctance to admit complexity. It turns out that the word  happiness  is just not a useful word anymore  because we apply it to too many different things. I think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it  but by and large  this is something that we'll have to give up and we'll have to adopt the more complicated view of what well being is. The second trap is a confusion between experience and memory  basically  it's between being happy in your life  and being happy about your life or happy with your life. And those are two very different concepts  and they're both lumped in the notion of happiness. And the third is the focusing illusion  and it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance that affects well being without distorting its importance. I mean  this is a real cognitive trap. There's just no way of getting it right. Now  I'd like to start with an example of somebody who had a question and answer session after one of my lectures reported a story  and that was a story    He said he'd been listening to a symphony  and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording  there was a dreadful screeching sound. And then he added  really quite emotionally  it ruined the whole experience. But it hadn't. What it had ruined were the memories of the experience. He had had the experience. He had had    minutes of glorious music. They counted for nothing because he was left with a memory  the memory was ruined  and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep. What this is telling us  really  is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves. There is an experiencing self  who lives in the present and knows the present  is capable of re living the past  but basically it has only the present. It's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches    you know  when the doctor asks   Does it hurt now when I touch you here   And then there is a remembering self  and the remembering self is the one that keeps score  and maintains the story of our life  and it's the one that the doctor approaches in asking the question   How have you been feeling lately   or  How was your trip to Albania   or something like that. Those are two very different entities  the experiencing self and the remembering self  and getting confused between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness. Now  the remembering self is a storyteller. And that really starts with a basic response of our memories    it starts immediately. We don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories. Our memory tells us stories  that is  what we get to keep from our experiences is a story. And let me begin with one example. This is an old study. Those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure. I won't go into detail. It's no longer painful these days  but it was painful when this study was run in the     s. They were asked to report on their pain every    seconds. Here are two patients  those are their recordings. And you are asked   Who of them suffered more   And it's a very easy question. Clearly  Patient B suffered more    his colonoscopy was longer  and every minute of pain that Patient A had  Patient B had  and more. But now there is another question   How much did these patients think they suffered   And here is a surprise. The surprise is that Patient A had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy than Patient B. The stories of the colonoscopies were different  and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends. And neither of these stories is very inspiring or great    but one of them is this distinct ...  Laughter  but one of them is distinctly worse than the other. And the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end  it's a bad story. How do we know that  Because we asked these people after their colonoscopy  and much later  too   How bad was the whole thing  in total   And it was much worse for A than for B  in memory. Now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self. From the point of view of the experiencing self  clearly  B had a worse time. Now  what you could do with Patient A  and we actually ran clinical experiments  and it has been done  and it does work    you could actually extend the colonoscopy of Patient A by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much. That will cause the patient to suffer  but just a little and much less than before. And if you do that for a couple of minutes  you have made the experiencing self of Patient A worse off  and you have the remembering self of Patient A a lot better off  because now you have endowed Patient A with a better story about his experience. What defines a story  And that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us  and it's also true of the stories that we make up. What defines a story are changes  significant moments and endings. Endings are very  very important and  in this case  the ending dominated. Now  the experiencing self lives its life continuously. It has moments of experience  one after the other. And you can ask  What happens to these moments  And the answer is really straightforward  They are lost forever. I mean  most of the moments of our life    and I calculated  you know  the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long  that means that  you know  in a life there are about     million of them  in a month  there are about            most of them don't leave a trace. Most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self. And yet  somehow you get the sense that they should count  that what happens during these moments of experience is our life. It's the finite resource that we're spending while we're on this earth. And how to spend it would seem to be relevant  but that is not the story that the remembering self keeps for us. So we have the remembering self and the experiencing self  and they're really quite distinct. The biggest difference between them is in the handling of time. From the point of view of the experiencing self  if you have a vacation  and the second week is just as good as the first  then the two week vacation is twice as good as the one week vacation. That's not the way it works at all for the remembering self. For the remembering self  a two week vacation is barely better than the one week vacation because there are no new memories added. You have not changed the story. And in this way  time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from an experiencing self  time has very little impact on the story. Now  the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories. It is actually the one that makes decisions because  if you have a patient who has had  say  two colonoscopies with two different surgeons and is deciding which of them to choose  then the one that chooses is the one that has the memory that is less bad  and that's the surgeon that will be chosen. The experiencing self has no voice in this choice. We actually don't choose between experiences  we choose between memories of experiences. And even when we think about the future  we don't think of our future normally as experiences. We think of our future as anticipated memories. And basically you can look at this  you know  as a tyranny of the remembering self  and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn't need. I have that sense that when we go on vacations this is very frequently the case  that is  we go on vacations  to a very large extent  in the service of our remembering self. And this is a bit hard to justify I think. I mean  how much do we consume our memories  That is one of the explanations that is given for the dominance of the remembering self. And when I think about that  I think about a vacation we had in Antarctica a few years ago  which was clearly the best vacation I've ever had  and I think of it relatively often  relative to how much I think of other vacations. And I probably have consumed my memories of that three week trip  I would say  for about    minutes in the last four years. Now  if I had ever opened the folder with the     pictures in it  I would have spent another hour. Now  that is three weeks  and that is at most an hour and a half. There seems to be a discrepancy. Now  I may be a bit extreme  you know  in how little appetite I have for consuming memories  but even if you do more of this  there is a genuine question  Why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences  So I want you to think about a thought experiment. Imagine that for your next vacation  you know that at the end of the vacation all your pictures will be destroyed  and you'll get an amnesic drug so that you won't remember anything. Now  would you choose the same vacation   Laughter  And if you would choose a different vacation  there is a conflict between your two selves  and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict  and it's actually not at all obvious  because if you think in terms of time  then you get one answer  and if you think in terms of memories  you might get another answer. Why do we pick the vacations we do is a problem that confronts us with a choice between the two selves. Now  the two selves bring up two notions of happiness. There are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply  one per self. So you can ask  How happy is the experiencing self  And then you would ask  How happy are the moments in the experiencing self's life  And they're all    happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process. What are the emotions that can be measured  And  by the way  now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time. If you ask for the happiness of the remembering self  it's a completely different thing. This is not about how happily a person lives. It is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life. Very different notion. Anyone who doesn't distinguish those notions is going to mess up the study of happiness  and I belong to a crowd of students of well being  who've been messing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way. The distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years  and there are now efforts to measure the two separately. The Gallup Organization has a world poll where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences  and there have been other efforts along those lines. So in recent years  we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two selves. And the main lesson I think that we have learned is they are really different. You can know how satisfied somebody is with their life  and that really doesn't teach you much about how happily they're living their life  and vice versa. Just to give you a sense of the correlation  the correlation is about . . What that means is if you met somebody  and you were told   Oh his father is six feet tall   how much would you know about his height  Well  you would know something about his height  but there's a lot of uncertainty. You have that much uncertainty. If I tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten  you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing self. So the correlation is low. We know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self. We know that money is very important  goals are very important. We know that happiness is mainly being satisfied with people that we like  spending time with people that we like. There are other pleasures  but this is dominant. So if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves  you are going to end up doing very different things. The bottom line of what I've said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitute for well being. It is a completely different notion. Now  very quickly  another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not attend to the same things when we think about life  and we actually live. So  if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California  you are not going to get to the correct answer. When you ask that question  you think people must be happier in California if  say  you live in Ohio. And what happens is when you think about living in California  you are thinking of the contrast between California and other places  and that contrast  say  is in climate. Well  it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and it's not even very important to the reflective self that decides how happy people are. But now  because the reflective self is in charge  you may end up    some people may end up moving to California. And it's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to California in the hope of getting happier. Well  their experiencing self is not going to get happier. We know that. But one thing will happen  They will think they are happier  because  when they think about it  they'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in Ohio  and they will feel they made the right decision. It is very difficult to think straight about well being  and I hope I have given you a sense of how difficult it is. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Thank you. I've got a question for you. Thank you so much. Now  when we were on the phone a few weeks ago  you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that Gallup survey. Is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now  Daniel Kahneman  Sure. I think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup survey is a number  which we absolutely did not expect to find. We found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self. When we looked at how feelings  vary with income. And it turns out that  below an income of        dollars a year  for Americans    and that's a very large sample of Americans  like          so it's a large representative sample    below an income of         dollars a year... CA        . DK        .        dollars a year  people are unhappy  and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get. Above that  we get an absolutely flat line. I mean I've rarely seen lines so flat. Clearly  what is happening is money does not buy you experiential happiness  but lack of money certainly buys you misery  and we can measure that misery very  very clearly. In terms of the other self  the remembering self  you get a different story. The more money you earn  the more satisfied you are. That does not hold for emotions. CA  But Danny  the whole American endeavor is about life  liberty  the pursuit of happiness. If people took seriously that finding  I mean  it seems to turn upside down everything we believe about  like for example  taxation policy and so forth. Is there any chance that politicians  that the country generally  would take a finding like that seriously and run public policy based on it  DK  You know I think that there is recognition of the role of happiness research in public policy. The recognition is going to be slow in the United States  no question about that  but in the U.K.  it is happening  and in other countries it is happening. People are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public policy. It's going to take a while  and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness  or whether they want to study life evaluation  so we need to have that debate fairly soon. How to enhance happiness goes very different ways depending on how you think  and whether you think of the remembering self or you think of the experiencing self. This is going to influence policy  I think  in years to come. In the United States  efforts are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population. This is going to be  I think  within the next decade or two  part of national statistics. CA  Well  it seems to me that this issue will    or at least should be    the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years. Thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics. Thank you  Danny Kahneman. So  what I'm going to do is just give you the latest episode of India's    maybe the world's    longest running soap opera  which is cricket. And may it run forever  because it gives people like me a living. It's got everything that you'd want a normal soap opera to want  It's got love  joy  happiness  sadness  tears  laughter  lots of deceit  intrigue. And like all good soaps  it jumps    years when the audience interest changes. And that's exactly what cricket has done. It's jumped    years into    over game. And that's what I'm going to talk about  how a small change leads to a very big revolution. But it wasn't always like that. Cricket wasn't always this speed driven generations game. There was a time when you played cricket  you played timeless test matches  when you played on till the game got over. And there was this game in March      that started on the third of March and ended on the   th of March. And it only ended because the English cricketers had to go from Durban to Cape Town  which is a two hour train journey  to catch the ship that left on the   th  because the next ship wasn't around for a long time. So  the match was ended in between. And one of the English batsmen said   You know what  Another half an hour and we would have won.  Another half an hour after    days. There were two Sundays in between. But of course  Sundays are church days  so you don't play on Sundays. And one day it rained  so they all sat around making friends with each other. But there is a reason why India fell in love with cricket  because we had about the same pace of life. The Mahabharata was like that as well  wasn't it  You fought by day  then it was sunset  so everyone went back home. And then you worked out your strategy  and you came and fought the next day  and you went back home again. The only difference between the Mahabharata and our cricket was that in cricket  everybody was alive to come back and fight the next day. Princes patronize the game  not because they love the game  but because it was a means of ingratiating themselves to the British rulers. But there is one other reason why India fell in love with cricket  which was  all you needed was a plank of wood and a rubber ball  and any number of people could play it anywhere. Take a look  You could play it in the dump with some rocks over there  you could play it in a little alley    you couldn't hit square anywhere  because the bat hit the wall  don't forget the air conditioning and the cable wires. You could play it on the banks of the Ganges    that's as clean as the Ganges has been for a long time. Or you could play many games in one small patch of land  even if you didn't know which game you were actually in. As you can see  you can play anywhere. But slowly the game moved on  you know  finally. You don't always have five days. So  we moved on  and we started playing    over cricket. And then an enormous accident took place. In Indian sport we don't make things happen  accidents happen and we're in the right place at the right time  sometimes. And we won this World Cup in     . And suddenly we fell in love with the    over game  and we played it virtually every day. There was more    over cricket than anywhere. But there was another big date.      was when we won the World Cup.      '    we found a finance minister and a prime minister willing to let the world look at India  rather than be this great country of intrigue and mystery in this closed country. And so we allowed multinationals into India. We cut customs duties  we reduced import duties  and we got all the multinationals coming in  with multinational budgets  who looked at per capita income and got very excited about the possibilities in India  and were looking for a vehicle to reach every Indian. And there are only two vehicles in India    one real  one scripted. The scripted one is what you see in the movies  the real one was cricket. And so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me  Ravi Dhariwal from Pepsi  decided he's going to take it all over the world. And Pepsi was this big revolution  because they started taking cricket all over. And so cricket started becoming big  cricket started bringing riches in. Television started covering cricket. For a long time television said   We won't cover cricket unless you pay us to cover it.  Then they said   OK  the next rights are sold for    million dollars. The next rights are sold for     million dollars.  So  it's a bit of a curve  that. And then another big accident happened in our cricket. England invented    overs cricket  and said   The world must play    overs cricket.  Just as England invented cricket  and made the rest of the world play it. Thank God for them. And so  India had to go and play the T   World Cup  you see. India didn't want to play the T   World Cup. But we were forced to play it by an     margin. And then something very dramatic happened. We got to the final  and then this moment  that will remain enshrined forever  for everybody  take a look. The Pakistani batsman trying to clear the fielder. Announcer  And Zishan takes it  India wins  What a match for a Twenty   final. India  the world champions. India  T   champions. But what a game we had  M. S. Dhoni got it right in the air  but Misbah ul Haq  what a player. A massive  massive success  India  the world TT champions. Harsha Bhogle  Suddenly India discovered this power of    overs cricket. The accident  of course  there  was that the batsman thought the bowler was bowling fast. If he had bowled fast  the ball would have gone where it was meant to go  but it didn't go. And we suddenly discovered that we could be good at this game. And what it also did was it led to a certain pride in the fact that India could be the best in the world. It was at a time when investment was coming in  India was feeling a little more confident about itself. And so there was a feeling that there was great pride in what we can do. And thankfully for all of us  the English are very good at inventing things  and then the gracious people that they are  they let the world become very good at it. And so England invented T   cricket  and allowed India to hijack it. It was not like reengineering that we do in medicine  we just took it straight away  as is. And so  we launched our own T   league. Six weeks  city versus city. It was a new thing for us. We had only ever supported our country    the only two areas in which India was very proud about their country  representing itself on the field. One was war  the Indian army  which we don't like to happen very often. The other was Indian cricket. Now  suddenly we had to support city leagues. But the people getting into these city leagues were people who were taking their cues from the West. America is a home of leagues. And they said   Right  we'll build some glitzy leagues here in India.  But was India ready for it  Because cricket  for a long time in India was always organized. It was never promoted  it was never sold    it was organized. And look what they did with our beautiful  nice  simple family game. All of a sudden  you had that happening. An opening ceremony to match every other. This was an India that was buying Corvettes. This was an India that was buying Jaguar. This was an India that was adding more mobile phones per month than New Zealand's population twice over. So  it was a different India. But it was also a slightly more orthodox India that was very happy to be modern  but didn't want to say that to people. And so  they were aghast when the cheerleaders arrived. Everyone secretly watched them  but everyone claimed not to. The new owners of Indian cricket were not the old princes. They were not bureaucrats who were forced into sport because they didn't actually love it  these were people who ran serious companies. And so they started promoting cricket big time  started promoting clubs big time. And they've started promoting them with huge money behind it. I mean the IPL had  .  billion dollars before a ball was bowled   .  billion dollars for television revenue over    years  and another    million dollars plus from all these franchises that were putting in money. And then they had to appeal to their cities  but they had to do it like the West  right  Because we are setting up leagues. But what they were very good at doing was making it very localized. So  just to give you an example of how they did it    not Manchester United style promotion  but very Mumbai style promotion. Take a look. Of course  a lot of people said   Maybe they dance better than they play.  But that's all right. What it did also is it changed the way we looked at cricket. All along  if you wanted a young cricketer  you picked him up from the bylanes of your own little locality  your own city  and you were very proud of the system that produced those cricketers. Now  all of the sudden  if you were to bowl a shot    if Mumbai were to bowl a shot  for example  they needn't go to Kalbadevi or Shivaji Park or somewhere to source them  they could go to Trinidad. This was the new India  wasn't it  This was the new world  where you can source from anywhere as long as you get the best product at the best price. And all of a sudden  Indian sport had awakened to the reality that you can source the best product for the best price anywhere in the world. So  the Mumbai Indians flew in Dwayne Bravo from Trinidad and Tobago  overnight. And when he had to go back to represent the West Indies  they asked him   When do you have to reach   He said   I have to be there by a certain time  so I have to leave today.  We said   No  no  no. It's not about when you have to leave  it's about when do you have to reach there   And so he said   I've got to reach on date X.  And they said   Fine  you play to date X  minus one.  So  he played in Hyderabad  went  straight after the game  went from the stadium to Hyderabad airport  sat in a private corporate jet    first refueling in Portugal  second refueling in Brazil  he was in West Indies in time. Never would India have thought on this scale before. Never would India have said   I want a player to play one game for me  and I will use a corporate jet to send him all the way back to Kingston  Jamaica to play a game.  And I just thought to myself   Wow  we've arrived somewhere in the world  you know  We have arrived somewhere. We are thinking big.  But what this also did was it started marrying the two most important things in Indian cricket  which is cricket and the movies in Indian entertainment. There is cricket and the movies. And they came together because people in the movies now started owning clubs. And so  people started going to the cricket to watch Preity Zinta. They started going to the cricket to watch Shah Rukh Khan. And something very interesting happened. We started getting song and dance in Indian cricket. And so it started resembling the Indian movies more and more. And of course  if you were on Preity Zinta's team    as you will see on the clip that follows    if you did well  you got a hug from Preity Zinta. So that was the ultimate reason to do well. Take a look    everyone's watching Preity Zinta. And then of course there was Shah Rukh playing the Kolkata crowd. We'd all seen matches in Kolkata  but we'd never seen anything like this  Shah Rukh  with the Bengali song  getting the audiences all worked up for Kolkata    not for India  but for Kolkata. But take a look at this. An Indian film star hugging a Pakistani cricketer because they'd won in Kolkata. Can you imagine  And do you know what the Pakistani cricketer said   I wish I was playing for Preity Zinta's team.  But I thought I'd take this opportunity    there's a few people from Pakistan in here. I'm so happy that you're here because I think we can show that we can both be together and be friends  right  We can play cricket together  we can be friends. So thank you very much for coming  all of you from Pakistan. There was criticism too because they said   Players are being bought and sold  Are they grain  Are they cattle   Because we had this auction  you see. How do you fix a price for a player  And so the auction that followed literally had people saying   Bang  so many million dollars for so and so player.  There it is. Auctioneer  Going at           dollars. Chennai. Shane Warne sold for         dollars. HB  Suddenly  a game which earned its players    rupees a day    so     rupees for a test match  but if you finish in four days you only got    . The best Indian players who played every test match    every one of the internationals  the top of the line players    standard contracts are         dollars in a whole year. Now they were getting         for six days' work. Then Andrew Flintoff came by from England  he got one and a half million dollars  and he went back and said   For four weeks  I'm earning more than Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard  and I'm earning more than the footballers  wow.  And where was he earning it from  From a little club in India. Could you have imagined that day would come  One and a half million dollars for six weeks' work. That's not bad  is it  So  at  .  billion dollars before the first ball was bowled. What India was doing  though  was benchmarking itself against the best in the world  and it became a huge brand. Lalit Modi was on the cover of Business Today. IPL became the biggest brand in India and  because our elections  had to be moved to South Africa  and we had to start the tournament in three weeks. Move a whole tournament to South Africa in three weeks. But we did it. You know why  Because no country works as slowly as we do till three weeks before an event  and nobody works fast as we do in the last three weeks. Our population  which for a long time we thought was a problem  suddenly became our biggest asset because there were more people watching    the huge consuming class    everybody came to watch the cricket. We'd also made cricket the only sport in India  which is a pity  but in India every other sport pushes cricket to become big  which is a bit of a tragedy of our times. Now  this last minute before I go    there's a couple of side effects of all this. For a long time  India was this country of poverty  dust  beggars  snake charmers  filth  Delhi belly    people heard Delhi belly stories before they came. And  all of a sudden  India was this land of opportunity. Cricketers all over the world said   You know  we love India. We love to play in India.  And that felt good  you know  We said   The dollar's quite powerful actually.  Can you imagine  you've got the dollar on view and there's no Delhi belly in there anymore. There's no filth  there's no beggars  all the snake charmers have vanished  everybody's gone. This tells you how the capitalist world rules. Right so  finally  an English game that India usurped a little bit  but T   is going to be the next missionary in the world. If you want to take the game around the world  it's got to be the shortest form of the game. You can't take a timeless test to China and sit through    days with no result in the end  or you can't take it all over the world. So that's what T   is doing. Hopefully  it'll make everyone richer  hopefully it'll make the game bigger and hopefully it'll give cricket commentators more time in the business. Thank you very much. Thank you. If I can leave you with one big idea today  it's that the whole of the data in which we consume is greater that the sum of the parts  and instead of thinking about information overload  what I'd like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns pop and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible. So what we're looking at right here is a typical mortality chart organized by age. This tool that I'm using here is a little experiment. It's called Pivot  and with Pivot what I can do is I can choose to filter in one particular cause of deaths    say  accidents. And  right away  I see there's a different pattern that emerges. This is because  in the mid area here  people are at their most active  and over here they're at their most frail. We can step back out again and then reorganize the data by cause of death  seeing that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects  but not for everyone. If we go ahead and we filter by age    say    years or less    we see that accidents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about. And if you drill into that  it's especially the case for men. So you get the idea that viewing information  viewing data in this way  is a lot like swimming in a living information info graphic. And if we can do this for raw data  why not do it for content as well  So what we have right here is the cover of every single Sports Illustrated ever produced. It's all here  it's all on the web. You can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk. With Pivot  you can drill into a decade. You can drill into a particular year. You can jump right into a specific issue. So I'm looking at this  I see the athletes that have appeared in this issue  the sports. I'm a Lance Armstrong fan  so I'll go ahead and I'll click on that  which reveals  for me  all the issues in which Lance Armstrong's been a part of. Now  if I want to just kind of take a peek at these  I might think   Well  what about taking a look at all of cycling   So I can step back  and expand on that. And I see Greg LeMond now. And so you get the idea that when you navigate over information this way    going narrower  broader  backing in  backing out    you're not searching  you're not browsing. You're doing something that's actually a little bit different. It's in between  and we think it changes the way information can be used. So I want to extrapolate on this idea a bit with something that's a little bit crazy. What we're done here is we've taken every single Wikipedia page and we reduced it down to a little summary. So the summary consists of just a little synopsis and an icon to indicate the topical area that it comes from. I'm only showing the top     most popular Wikipedia pages right here. But even in this limited view  we can do a lot of things. Right away  we get a sense of what are the topical domains that are most popular on Wikipedia. I'm going to go ahead and select government. Now  having selected government  I can now see that the Wikipedia categories that most frequently correspond to that are Time magazine People of the Year. So this is really important because this is an insight that was not contained within any one Wikipedia page. It's only possible to see that insight when you step back and look at all of them. Looking at one of these particular summaries  I can then drill into the concept of Time magazine Person of the Year  bringing up all of them. So looking at these people  I can see that the majority come from government  some have come from natural sciences  some  fewer still  have come from business    there's my boss    and one has come from music. And interestingly enough  Bono is also a TED Prize winner. So we can go  jump  and take a look at all the TED Prize winners. So you see  we're navigating the web for the first time as if it's actually a web  not from page to page  but at a higher level of abstraction. And so I want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise. I'm just showing the New York Times website here. So Pivot  this application    I don't want to call it a browser  it's really not a browser  but you can view web pages with it    and we bring that zoomable technology to every single web page like this. So I can step back  pop right back into a specific section. Now the reason why this is important is because  by virtue of just viewing web pages in this way  I can look at my entire browsing history in the exact same way. So I can drill into what I've done over specific time frames. Here  in fact  is the state of all the demo that I just gave. And I can sort of replay some stuff that I was looking at earlier today. And  if I want to step back and look at everything  I can slice and dice my history  perhaps by my search history    here  I was doing some nepotistic searching  looking for Bing  over here for Live Labs Pivot. And from these  I can drill into the web page and just launch them again. It's one metaphor repurposed multiple times  and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data. So right now  in this world  we think about data as being this curse. We talk about the curse of information overload. We talk about drowning in data. What if we can actually turn that upside down and turn the web upside down  so that instead of navigating from one thing to the next  we get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things  and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden  If we can do that  then instead of being trapped in data  we might actually extract information. And  instead of dealing just with information  we can tease out knowledge. And if we get the knowledge  then maybe even there's wisdom to be found. So with that  I thank you. I grew up on a steady diet of science fiction. In high school  I took a bus to school an hour each way every day. And I was always absorbed in a book  science fiction book  which took my mind to other worlds  and satisfied  in a narrative form  this insatiable sense of curiosity that I had. And you know  that curiosity also manifested itself in the fact that whenever I wasn't in school I was out in the woods  hiking and taking  samples     frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water    and bringing it back  looking at it under the microscope. You know  I was a real science geek. But it was all about trying to understand the world  understand the limits of possibility. And my love of science fiction actually seemed mirrored in the world around me  because what was happening  this was in the late '  s  we were going to the moon  we were exploring the deep oceans. Jacques Cousteau was coming into our living rooms with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places and a wondrous world that we could never really have previously imagined. So  that seemed to resonate with the whole science fiction part of it. And I was an artist. I could draw. I could paint. And I found that because there weren't video games and this saturation of CG movies and all of this imagery in the media landscape  I had to create these images in my head. You know  we all did  as kids having to read a book  and through the author's description  put something on the movie screen in our heads. And so  my response to this was to paint  to draw alien creatures  alien worlds  robots  spaceships  all that stuff. I was endlessly getting busted in math class doodling behind the textbook. That was    the creativity had to find its outlet somehow. And an interesting thing happened  The Jacques Cousteau shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on Earth. I might not really go to an alien world on a spaceship someday    that seemed pretty darn unlikely. But that was a world I could really go to  right here on Earth  that was as rich and exotic as anything that I had imagined from reading these books. So  I decided I was going to become a scuba diver at the age of   . And the only problem with that was that I lived in a little village in Canada      miles from the nearest ocean. But I didn't let that daunt me. I pestered my father until he finally found a scuba class in Buffalo  New York  right across the border from where we live. And I actually got certified in a pool at a YMCA in the dead of winter in Buffalo  New York. And I didn't see the ocean  a real ocean  for another two years  until we moved to California. Since then  in the intervening    years  I've spent about       hours underwater  and     hours of that was in submersibles. And I've learned that that deep ocean environment  and even the shallow oceans  are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagination. Nature's imagination is so boundless compared to our own meager human imagination. I still  to this day  stand in absolute awe of what I see when I make these dives. And my love affair with the ocean is ongoing  and just as strong as it ever was. But when I chose a career as an adult  it was filmmaking. And that seemed to be the best way to reconcile this urge I had to tell stories with my urges to create images. And I was  as a kid  constantly drawing comic books  and so on. So  filmmaking was the way to put pictures and stories together  and that made sense. And of course the stories that I chose to tell were science fiction stories   Terminator    Aliens  and  The Abyss.  And with  The Abyss   I was putting together my love of underwater and diving with filmmaking. So  you know  merging the two passions. Something interesting came out of  The Abyss   which was that to solve a specific narrative problem on that film  which was to create this kind of liquid water creature  we actually embraced computer generated animation  CG. And this resulted in the first soft surface character  CG animation that was ever in a movie. And even though the film didn't make any money    barely broke even  I should say    I witnessed something amazing  which is that the audience  the global audience  was mesmerized by this apparent magic. You know  it's Arthur Clarke's law that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. They were seeing something magical. And so that got me very excited. And I thought   Wow  this is something that needs to be embraced into the cinematic art.  So  with  Terminator     which was my next film  we took that much farther. Working with ILM  we created the liquid metal dude in that film. The success hung in the balance on whether that effect would work. And it did  and we created magic again  and we had the same result with an audience    although we did make a little more money on that one. So  drawing a line through those two dots of experience came to   This is going to be a whole new world   this was a whole new world of creativity for film artists. So  I started a company with Stan Winston  my good friend Stan Winston  who is the premier make up and creature designer at that time  and it was called Digital Domain. And the concept of the company was that we would leapfrog past the analog processes of optical printers and so on  and we would go right to digital production. And we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while. But we found ourselves lagging in the mid '  s in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually founded the company to do. So  I wrote this piece called  Avatar   which was meant to absolutely push the envelope of visual effects  of CG effects  beyond  with realistic human emotive characters generated in CG  and the main characters would all be in CG  and the world would be in CG. And the envelope pushed back  and I was told by the folks at my company that we weren't going to be able to do this for a while. So  I shelved it  and I made this other movie about a big ship that sinks. You know  I went and pitched it to the studio as  'Romeo and Juliet' on a ship   It's going to be this epic romance  passionate film.  Secretly  what I wanted to do was I wanted to dive to the real wreck of  Titanic.  And that's why I made the movie. And that's the truth. Now  the studio didn't know that. But I convinced them. I said   We're going to dive to the wreck. We're going to film it for real. We'll be using it in the opening of the film. It will be really important. It will be a great marketing hook.  And I talked them into funding an expedition. Sounds crazy. But this goes back to that theme about your imagination creating a reality. Because we actually created a reality where six months later  I find myself in a Russian submersible two and a half miles down in the north Atlantic  looking at the real Titanic through a view port. Not a movie  not HD    for real. Now  that blew my mind. And it took a lot of preparation  we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things. But  it struck me how much this dive  these deep dives  was like a space mission. You know  where it was highly technical  and it required enormous planning. You get in this capsule  you go down to this dark hostile environment where there is no hope of rescue if you can't get back by yourself. And I thought like   Wow. I'm like  living in a science fiction movie. This is really cool.  And so  I really got bitten by the bug of deep ocean exploration. Of course  the curiosity  the science component of it    it was everything. It was adventure  it was curiosity  it was imagination. And it was an experience that Hollywood couldn't give me. Because  you know  I could imagine a creature and we could create a visual effect for it. But I couldn't imagine what I was seeing out that window. As we did some of our subsequent expeditions  I was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents and sometimes things that I had never seen before  sometimes things that no one had seen before  that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and imaged them. So  I was completely smitten by this  and had to do more. And so  I actually made a kind of curious decision. After the success of  Titanic   I said   OK  I'm going to park my day job as a Hollywood movie maker  and I'm going to go be a full time explorer for a while.  And so  we started planning these expeditions. And we wound up going to the Bismark  and exploring it with robotic vehicles. We went back to the Titanic wreck. We took little bots that we had created that spooled a fiber optic. And the idea was to go in and do an interior survey of that ship  which had never been done. Nobody had ever looked inside the wreck. They didn't have the means to do it  so we created technology to do it. So  you know  here I am now  on the deck of Titanic  sitting in a submersible  and looking out at planks that look much like this  where I knew that the band had played. And I'm flying a little robotic vehicle through the corridor of the ship. When I say   I'm operating it   but my mind is in the vehicle. I felt like I was physically present inside the shipwreck of Titanic. And it was the most surreal kind of deja vu experience I've ever had  because I would know before I turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed it  because I had walked the set for months when we were making the movie. And the set was based as an exact replica on the blueprints of the ship. So  it was this absolutely remarkable experience. And it really made me realize that the telepresence experience    that you actually can have these robotic avatars  then your consciousness is injected into the vehicle  into this other form of existence. It was really  really quite profound. And it may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happening some decades out as we start to have cyborg bodies for exploration or for other means in many sort of post human futures that I can imagine  as a science fiction fan. So  having done these expeditions  and really beginning to appreciate what was down there  such as at the deep ocean vents where we had these amazing  amazing animals    they're basically aliens right here on Earth. They live in an environment of chemosynthesis. They don't survive on sunlight based system the way we do. And so  you're seeing animals that are living next to a     degree Centigrade water plumes. You think they can't possibly exist. At the same time I was getting very interested in space science as well    again  it's the science fiction influence  as a kid. And I wound up getting involved with the space community  really involved with NASA  sitting on the NASA advisory board  planning actual space missions  going to Russia  going through the pre cosmonaut biomedical protocols  and all these sorts of things  to actually go and fly to the international space station with our  D camera systems. And this was fascinating. But what I wound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep. And taking them down so that they had access    astrobiologists  planetary scientists  people who were interested in these extreme environments    taking them down to the vents  and letting them see  and take samples and test instruments  and so on. So  here we were making documentary films  but actually doing science  and actually doing space science. I'd completely closed the loop between being the science fiction fan  you know  as a kid  and doing this stuff for real. And you know  along the way in this journey of discovery  I learned a lot. I learned a lot about science. But I also learned a lot about leadership. Now you think director has got to be a leader  leader of  captain of the ship  and all that sort of thing. I didn't really learn about leadership until I did these expeditions. Because I had to  at a certain point  say   What am I doing out here  Why am I doing this  What do I get out of it   We don't make money at these damn shows. We barely break even. There is no fame in it. People sort of think I went away between  Titanic  and  Avatar  and was buffing my nails someplace  sitting at the beach. Made all these films  made all these documentary films for a very limited audience. No fame  no glory  no money. What are you doing  You're doing it for the task itself  for the challenge    and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is    for the thrill of discovery  and for that strange bond that happens when a small group of people form a tightly knit team. Because we would do these things with        people  working for years at a time  sometimes at sea for two  three months at a time. And in that bond  you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you  that you've done a task that you can't explain to someone else. When you come back to the shore and you say   We had to do this  and the fiber optic  and the attentuation  and the this and the that  all the technology of it  and the difficulty  the human performance aspects of working at sea   you can't explain it to people. It's that thing that maybe cops have  or people in combat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it. Creates a bond  creates a bond of respect. So  when I came back to make my next movie  which was  Avatar   I tried to apply that same principle of leadership  which is that you respect your team  and you earn their respect in return. And it really changed the dynamic. So  here I was again with a small team  in uncharted territory  doing  Avatar   coming up with new technology that didn't exist before. Tremendously exciting. Tremendously challenging. And we became a family  over a four and half year period. And it completely changed how I do movies. So  people have commented on how   Well  you know  you brought back the ocean organisms and put them on the planet of Pandora.  To me  it was more of a fundamental way of doing business  the process itself  that changed as a result of that. So  what can we synthesize out of all this  You know  what are the lessons learned  Well  I think number one is curiosity. It's the most powerful thing you own. Imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality. And the respect of your team is more important than all the laurels in the world. I have young filmmakers come up to me and say   Give me some advice for doing this.  And I say   Don't put limitations on yourself. Other people will do that for you    don't do it to yourself  don't bet against yourself  and take risks.  NASA has this phrase that they like   Failure is not an option.  But failure has to be an option in art and in exploration  because it's a leap of faith. And no important endeavor that required innovation was done without risk. You have to be willing to take those risks. So  that's the thought I would leave you with  is that in whatever you're doing  failure is an option  but fear is not. Thank you. I'm Jon M. Chu. And I'm not a dancer  I'm not a choreographer    I'm actually a filmmaker  a storyteller. I directed a movie two years ago called  Step Up    The Streets.  Anybody  Anybody  Yeah  During that movie I got to meet a ton of hip hop dancers    amazing  the best in the world    and they brought me into a society  the sort of underground street culture that blew my mind. I mean  this is literally human beings with super human strength and abilities. They could fly in the air. They could bend their elbow all the way back. They could spin on their heads for    times in a row. I'd never seen anything like that. When I was growing up  my heroes were people like Fred Astaire  Gene Kelly  Michael Jackson. I grew up in a musical family. And those guys  those were like  ultimate heroes. Being a shy  little  skinny Asian kid growing up in the Silicon Valley with low self esteem  those guys made me believe in something bigger. Those guys made me want to  like   I'm going to do that moonwalk at that bar mitzvah tonight for that girl.  And it seems like those dance heroes have disappeared  sort of relegated to the background of pop stars and music videos. But after seeing what I've seen  the truth is  they have not disappeared at all. They're here  getting better and better every day. And dance has progressed. It is insane what dance is right now. Dance has never had a better friend than technology. Online videos and social networking ... dancers have created a whole global laboratory online for dance  where kids in Japan are taking moves from a YouTube video created in Detroit  building on it within days and releasing a new video  while teenagers in California are taking the Japanese video and remixing it with a Philly flair to create a whole new dance style in itself. And this is happening every day. And from these bedrooms and living rooms and garages  with cheap webcams  lies the world's great dancers of tomorrow. Our Fred Astaires  our Gene Kellys our Michael Jacksons are right at our fingertips  and may not have that opportunity  except for us. So  we created the LXD  sort of a    the Legion of Extraordinary Dancers  a justice league of dancers that believe that dance can have a transformative effect on the world. A living  breathing comic book series  but unlike Spiderman and Iron Man  these guys can actually do it. And we're going to show you some today. So  let me introduce to you  some of our heroes right now. We got Madd Chadd  Lil' C  Kid David and J Smooth. Please be excited  have fun  yell  scream. Ladies and gentlemen  The LXD. I get a lot of different reactions actually. Sometimes you would think that maybe kids would enjoy it  but sometimes they get a little freaked out. And  I don't know  I kind of get a kick out of that a little bit. J Smooth  When I'm in the zone    I'm dancing and free styling it    I actually visually kind of picture lines  and moving them. I think of like  Transformers  like how panels open and then they fold  they fold in  and then you close that panel. And then another thing opens  you close that. Kid David  It's kind of like  honestly a lot of times I don't really know what's going on when I'm dancing. Because at that point it's just really like  it's my body and the music. It's not really a conscious decision   I'm going to do this next  I'm going to do this.  It's kind of like this other level where you can't make choices anymore  and it's just your body reacting to certain sounds in the music. I got my name just because I was so young. I was young when I started. I was younger than a lot of the people I was dancing with. So  it was always like  they called me Kid David  because I was the kid. L'il C  I tell them to create a ball  and then you just use that ball of energy. And instead of throwing it out  people would think that's a krump move  that's a krump move. That's not a krump move. You're going to throw it out  you throw it out  and you hold it. And you let it go  and then right when you see the tail  you grab it by the tail  then you bring it back in. And you just got this piece of energy and you just  you're manipulating it. You know  you create power  then you tame it. I have a vision for each one of you  and the vision I have for you is that when you wake up in the morning  your blood is singing at the thought of being who you are and doing what you do  that as you go through the day  you can literally sink to your knees in gratitude at the tremendous good fortune that's been bestowed on you  that as you go through the day  you become radiantly alive several times. And if your life isn't like that  I'd like to humbly suggest that you're wasting your life. A life is too short to be wasted. So what I propose to do in the next    minutes    I've used up one minute already    is to give you a set of powerful tools which can get you started on being there. Is that of interest to you  Audience  Yes. Srikumar Rao  OK. This is a conference on happiness  but even if it wasn't a conference on happiness  would it be right if I said that in some way  shape  fashion or form  you're devoting your entire life to being happy  Everything you do    your job  family  children  relationships  whatever    is a quest for happiness. Correct  I'd like you to think about the following  What do you have to get in order to be happy  We're just going to spend a minute on this. What do you have to get in order to be happy  Anybody  quick  When I conduct this experiment  a bunch of stuff comes up  vast wealth  trophy spouse  good health  lots of travel  time  etc  etc  etc. Right now  if you were to think about it  you probably have a list of   Here's what I need to get in order to be happy.  I would like you to consider this  anything that you can get    let me repeat that    anything you can get  you can un get. Is that correct  So  vast wealth can make you happy. Vast wealth can disappear tomorrow. A number of people in the financial sector have discovered this already. So whatever you get that can make you happy can go away. Where does that leave you  Not a very nice place  right  I have a different proposition to suggest to you. What I have to suggest to you is that there is nothing that you have to get  do or be in order to be happy. Let me repeat that  there is nothing that you have to get  do or be in order to be happy. In fact  happiness is your innate nature. It is hardwired into you. It is part of your DNA. You cannot not be happy. Now  all of you are very polite  and in some of the other forums I speak in  such as top business schools  they're not so polite. And invariably  somebody articulates what many of you are thinking  which is   If happiness is my innate nature  how come I am not experiencing it  How come I am experiencing my life sucks   And the answer to that is actually very simple. You have spent your entire life learning to be unhappy. Let me repeat that  you have spent your entire life learning to be unhappy. And the way we learn to be unhappy is by buying into a particular mental model. A mental model is a notion we have that this is the way the world works. All of us have mental models  we've got dozens of mental models. We've got mental models on how to find a job  how to get ahead at work  how to pick a restaurant to eat at  how to have a movie to go to ... dozens of them. The problem isn't that we have mental models. The problem is that we don't know that we have mental models. We think this is the way the world works. And the more we invest in a mental model  the more it appears that this  in fact  is the way the world works. But it isn't  it's just a mental model  and the mental model we have that we buy into so strongly is that we have to get something so we can do something so we can be something. Like  we have to get a great deal of money so we can travel to exotic places so we can be happy. We have to be in a relationship so we can have great sex so we can be happy. All of this is a variation of the if then model. And the if then model is  if this happens  then we will be happy. If I were to get a better job  if I were to get more money  if my boss would have a heart attack  if only I was married  if only my wife would leave me    if only I had children  if my children would grow up and go to college ... It doesn't matter what it is. The whole notion is if this happens  then I will be happy. And right now  the only thing that's different between the persons in this audience is what is the particular  if  that you are focusing on  And the only thing that's different between you now and where you were    years ago is what is the particular  if  that you were focusing on  Think about your life    years ago. Spend a minute doing that. Ten years ago  if you remember clearly  there were certain things you wanted. Is that correct  Odds are pretty good that many of those things you wanted    years ago you now have. Is that correct  Where has that left you  In exactly the same place  right  What we don't realize is the model itself is flawed. The if then model     If this happens I will be happy     the model itself is flawed. But instead of recognizing that it is the model itself that's flawed  what we do is spend enormous amounts of time changing the  if.   Oh  well  I thought if I became CEO it would help  but now I realize it's not that I want to become a CEO. I want to become the billionaire CEO  and then I will be happy.  You've got your own variation on that. But it's the model itself that's flawed  not what you put on the  if  side of the equation. I can demonstrate that to you. Can any of you recall a time when you were confronted with a scene of such spectacular beauty that it took you outside of yourself into a place of great serenity  Maybe a rainbow  a mountain range  a valley  the sea. And if you remember that    raise your hands if you could. Virtually all of you could  right  Have you ever wondered why that happened  The reason that happened is that somehow  for some reason  at that instant  you accepted the universe exactly as it was. You didn't say   That's a beautiful rainbow  but it's kind of off to the left  and if I could move it     yards to the right  it would be ever so much more beautiful.  You didn't say   That's a beautiful valley  but the tree in the foreground has too many crooked branches. So if you gave me a chainsaw and    minutes  I'd make it ever so much better.  Oh no  the rainbow off center was just fine. The tree with its crooked branches was just fine. And the moment you accepted the universe just as it was  your habitual wanting self dropped away  and the happiness which is your innate nature surfaced  and you felt it. And I know you felt it because now  even now after all those years  you can still remember it. The problem is that your life right now  with all of the problems that you have    more precisely  all of the problems that you think you have    is equally perfect. But you do not accept it. In fact  you're spending all your time striving with might and main to make it different. You are not accepting it. And when you're not accepting it  you're buying into the if then model  if this happens  then I will be happy. And it's the model itself that is flawed. So let me show you how you can get out of that  or at least you can begin the steps towards getting out of that. I'd like to share with you that action. We all live our lives because we want to achieve something  correct  You know  we are here and we want to have something. Alex wants to have a successful conference. You know  many of you want to have great programs for your companies that are very successful. You want to progress  have more money  all of that  is that correct  Each of those is an outcome  you would like something to happen. Now  I'd like you to think about the following  actions are within your control  not entirely  but to a large extent. The outcome is completely out of your control. OK  Actions are within your control. The outcome is completely outside your control. Have any of you recognized that when you have a goal and you start to work towards it  some of the time you don't achieve your goal  and some of the time what you get is the exact opposite of what you wanted  Has that happened to any of you  Like there was a friend of mine who said   Gee  you know  I have not been paying a lot of attention to my wife  and this has to change.  So the next time we went on a business trip  he bought a very expensive dress for her. And this was his way of showing  you know  I care for you  and nice things would happen. And when he presented the gift to his wife  her immediate reaction was   After    years of marriage  you don't know my size    And furthermore  don't you know I never wear this kind of thing   And the next thing you know  he had a full blown marital spat. Has that happened to any of you  You've taken action for a particular outcome and the outcome you got was the exact opposite of what you wanted  Happens all the time. Well  we live in a world where what we think of  what we invest in  is the outcome. We define our life in the following way  here I am  here is where I want to go  these are the steps I have to take in order to get from where I am to where I want to go  and if I succeed  life is wonderful. And if I don't  then I have failed  life is no good  life sucks. True  False  That is how we live. We invest in the outcome  and as I've just pointed out  the outcome is frequently different from what we would like  and sometimes the diametric opposite of what we would like. You invest in the outcome and you are guaranteed to have more than your share of frustration  angst and all the rest of the stuff that makes life suck. There is an alternative. And the alternative is that you do not invest in the outcome  you invest in the process. And the best way to describe that is a quote by John Wooden. I don't know how many of you are familiar with John Wooden. He's very well known in the United States and certainly among basketball fans. He's the only person ever to make the basketball Hall of Fame both as a player and as a coach. And what he told his entering team    he led UCLA to an unprecedented number of victories and finals in the NCAA    and what he used to tell any new team is he never spoke about winning. He always said   When it's over and you look in the mirror  did you do the best that you were capable of  And if you did the best that you were capable of  the score doesn't matter. But I would suspect that if you did the best that you were capable of  you will find the score to your liking.  That is investing in a process. What we do is the exact opposite. We invest in the outcome. This is what I want    oh  I want it so desperately  because if I get it I will be happy. And you try with might and main  to do whatever you can  but you are always focusing on   This is the outcome.  Now  focusing on the outcome is fine. It gives you direction. Investing in the outcome means that you make the achievement of a particular outcome dependent for your well being. And that is a surefire recipe for failure. What you can do is something else. You can invest in the process. That is  once you have determined  here is where I am  here is where I want to be  and that's fine  you focus on the outcome only to the extent that it gives you direction  and then you invest yourself completely in the process. You say  here are the steps you want to take  and you put everything into it. And if you succeed  wonderful. And if you don't succeed  still wonderful  because now you have a new starting point  and from that new starting point  you select another outcome and keep going. And when you do that  you will find that every day is a blast. Let me give you an example. And if you have children    raise your hands if you have children. Have you ever seen a small child learn to walk  What happens  and this happens typically between    and    months  is the child gets up and she sees everybody walking  she wants to walk  she gets up  she falls down  she starts crying and momma runs up and comforts her  kisses the place  makes it well. She tries again  falls down  mommy runs up again. After some time  mommy feels tired and no longer runs up and the child stops crying  and then she gets up  takes a step and doesn't fall down  and then she takes another  and a beautiful smile comes on her face. And very soon  generally within    hours  she's walking all over the place  upsetting your living room arrangements. And you know you've gone to a new stage of parenting. Right  Now  imagine what would happen if each time the child fell  she would say   Oh my God  I failed again. I'm never going to learn to walk.  And you have to get counseling for her to help her deal with feelings of inadequacy and not being able to achieve and fail yet again. How long do you think it would take her to learn to walk if you had to do that  if every three times she fell down  you had to get a counselor to counsel her and so on  Sounds funny  doesn't it  But that is exactly what we're doing. What the child is doing is focusing on the process. She's investing in the process  not in the outcome. What we do is the exact opposite. As we grow up  we lose the ability to invest in the process  we start investing in the outcome. By definition the outcome is outside of our control  and if that's where we spend all of our emotional energy  we are going to get drained as we do. But if  on the other hand  we said   Here is the outcome  I am going to invest in the process and give it every single bit I could   every day is a blast  and you're well on your way to achieving the vision that I outlined to you. The question that I get all the time  is people say   Professor Rao  but nothing makes me passionate.  So I say   OK  what would   And they invariably come up with  you know  here is a list of things. Here's my job and here's how much it pays  this is the kind of person my boss is  the kind of people my colleagues are  and here's how my customers are  here's how much I travel  here's how big my office is  how deep the carpeting is  how many windows I have    a bunch of parameters. And what I tell them is what I want to share with you  because all of that stuff    first of all  it doesn't exist. But second  even if it did and you were plugged into it  it would not take more than six months for you to be the same sorry  miserable self there as you are now  because passion exists inside you. It does not exist in the job. And if you don't find a way to ignite it within you right where you are  you are not going to find it outside. But if you do find a way to ignite it where you are  then you will find that the external world rearranges itself to accommodate the new person that you are becoming. And as you do that  you will find that miracles happen on a regular basis. Persons come up whom you're delighted to meet. New people enter your life. It's just a breeze  because all you do in your life is you take journeys. You came here to this conference  you went on a journey. You hang around the water cooler  talking about how terrible your place of work is  you went on a journey. You watch  Desperate Housewives   you go on a journey. You go on a journey where    something women are having affairs with    something gardeners while the husbands are playing around with models. All you do is go on journeys. There's nothing wrong with that  but just ask yourself   Is this a journey I want to take  Does this take me to a place I want to spend time   And if you start doing that  you will find that your life changes. The kind of people you meet  the things you talk about  the movies you go to  the books you read    everything changes. And you begin all of that by focusing on the process. Invest in the process  not in the outcome. Thank you. Last year here at TED I asked you to give me your data  to put your data on the web  on the basis that if people put data onto the web    government data  scientific data  community data  whatever it is    it will be used by other people to do wonderful things  in ways that they never could have imagined. So  today I'm back just to show you a few things  to show you  in fact  there is an open data movement afoot  now  around the world. The cry of  Raw data now   which I made people make in the auditorium  was heard around the world. So  let's roll the video. A classic story  the first one which lots of people picked up  was when in March    on March   th in fact  soon after TED    Paul Clarke  in the U.K. government  blogged   Oh  I've just got some raw data. Here it is  it's about bicycle accidents.  Two days it took the Times Online to make a map  a mashable map    we call these things mash ups    a mashed up user interface that allows you to go in there and have a look and find out whether your bicycle route to work was affected. Here's more data  traffic survey data  again  put out by the U.K. government  and because they put it up using the Linked Data standards  then a user could just make a map  just by clicking. Does this data affect things  Well  let's get back to     . Look at Zanesville  Ohio. Here's a map a lawyer made. He put on it the water plant  and which houses are there  which houses have been connected to the water. And he got  from other data sources  information to show which houses are occupied by white people. Well  there was too much of a correlation  he felt  between which houses were occupied by white people and which houses had water  and the judge was not impressed either. The judge was not impressed to the tune of   .  million dollars. That's the power of taking one piece of data  another piece of data  putting it together  and showing the result. Let's look at some data from the U.K. now. This is U.K. government data  a completely independent site  Where Does My Money Go. It allows anybody to go there and burrow down. You can burrow down by a particular type of spending  or you can go through all the different regions and compare them. So  that's happening in the U.K. with U.K. government data. Yes  certainly you can do it over here. Here's a site which allows you to look at recovery spending in California. Take an arbitrary example  Long Beach  California  you can go and have a look at what recovery money they've been spending on different things such as energy. In fact  this is the graph of the number of data sets in the repositories of data.gov  and data.gov.uk. And I'm delighted to see a great competition between the U.K. in blue  and the U.S. in red. How can you use this stuff  Well  for example  if you have lots of data about places you can take  from a postcode    which is like a zip plus four    for a specific group of houses  you can make paper  print off a paper which has got very  very specific things about the bus stops  the things specifically near you. On a larger scale  this is a mash up of the data which was released about the Afghan elections. It allows you to set your own criteria for what sort of things you want to look at. The red circles are polling stations  selected by your criteria. And then you can select also other things on the map to see what other factors  like the threat level. So  that was government data. I also talked about community generated data    in fact I edited some. This is the wiki map  this is the Open Street Map.  Terrace Theater  I actually put on the map because it wasn't on the map before TED last year. I was not the only person editing the open street map. Each flash on this visualization    put together by ITO World    shows an edit in      made to the Open Street Map. Let's now spin the world during the same year. Every flash is an edit. Somebody somewhere looking at the Open Street Map  and realizing it could be better. You can see Europe is ablaze with updates. Some places  perhaps not as much as they should be. Here focusing in on Haiti. The map of Port au Prince at the end of      was not all it could be  not as good as the map of California. Fortunately  just after the earthquake  GeoEye  a commercial company  released satellite imagery with a license  which allowed the open source community to use it. This is January  in time lapse  of people editing ... that's the earthquake. After the earthquake  immediately  people all over the world  mappers who wanted to help  and could  looked at that imagery  built the map  quickly building it up. We're focusing now on Port au Prince. The light blue is refugee camps these volunteers had spotted from the  satellite images . So  now we have  immediately  a real time map showing where there are refugee camps    rapidly became the best map to use if you're doing relief work in Port au Prince. Witness the fact that it's here on this Garmin device being used by rescue team in Haiti. There's the map showing  on the left hand side  that hospital    actually that's a hospital ship. This is a real time map that shows blocked roads  damaged buildings  refugee camps    it shows things that are needed  for rescue and relief work . So  if you've been involved in that at all  I just wanted to say  Whatever you've been doing  whether you've just been chanting   Raw data now   or you've been putting government or scientific data online  I just wanted to take this opportunity to say  Thank you very much  and we have only just started  I only have three minutes so I'm going to have to talk fast  and it will use up your spare mental cycles  so multitasking may be hard. So     years ago I got a traffic ticket that got me thinking. I've had some time to think it over. And energy efficiency is more than just about the vehicle    it's also about the road. Road design makes a difference  particularly intersections  of which there are two types  signalized and unsignalized  which means stop signs. Fifty percent of crashes happen at intersections. Roundabouts are much better. A study of    intersections has found crashes drop    percent from when you convert a traffic light into a roundabout. Injury crashes have dropped    percent  fatal crashes down    percent. But that's just safety. What about time and gas  So  traffic keeps flowing  so that means less braking  which means less accelerating  less gas and less pollution  less time wasted  and that partly accounts for Europe's better efficiency than we have in the United States. So  unsignalized intersections  meaning stop signs  they save many lives  but there's an excessive proliferation of them. Small roundabouts are starting to appear. This is one in my neighborhood. And they are much better    better than traffic lights  better than four way stop signs. They're expensive to install  but they are more expensive not to. So  we should look at that. But they are not applicable in all situations. So  take  for example  the three way intersection. So  it's logical that you'd have one there  on the minor road entering the major. But the other two are somewhat questionable. So  here's one. There's another one which I studied. Cars rarely appear on that third road. And so  the question is  what does that cost us  That intersection I looked at had about       cars per day in each direction  and so that's two ounces of gas to accelerate out of. That's five cents each  and times       cars per day  that's         per year. That's just the gasoline cost. There is also pollution  wear on the car  and time. What's that time worth  Well  at    seconds per       cars  that's  .  hours per day. The average wage in the U.S. is     an hour. That is        per year. Add that together with the gas  and it's          per year  just for that sign in each direction. Discount that back to the present  at five percent  over two million dollars for a stop sign  in each direction. Now  if you look at what that adjacent property is worth  you could actually buy the property  cut down the shrubbery to improve the sight line  and then sell it off again. And you'd still come out ahead. So  it makes one wonder   Why is it there   I mean  why is there that stop sign in each direction  Because it is saving lives. So  is there a better way to accomplish that goal  The answer is to enable cars to come in from that side road safely. Because there are a lot of people who might live up there and if they're waiting forever a long queue could form because the cars aren't slowing down on the main road. Can that be accomplished with existing signs  So  there is a long history of stop signs and yield signs. Stop signs were invented in       yield signs in     . But that's all we got. So  why not use a yield sign  Well the meaning of yield is  You must yield the right of way. That means that if there are five cars waiting  you have to wait till they all go  then you go. It lacks the notion of alternating  or taking turns  and it's always on the minor road  allowing the major one to have primacy. So  it's hard to create a new meaning for the existing sign. You couldn't suddenly tell everyone   OK  remember what you used to do at yield signs  Now do something different.  That would not work. So  what the world needs now is a new type of sign. So  you'd have a little instruction below it  you know  for those who didn't see the public service announcements. And it merges the stop sign and yield signs. It's kind of shaped like a T  as in taking turns. And uncertainty results in caution. When people come to an unfamiliar situation they don't know how to deal with they slow down. So  now that you are all  Road Scholars  ... don't wait for that sign to be adopted  these things don't change quickly. But you all are members of communities  and you can exercise your community influence to create more sensible traffic flows. And you can have more impact on the environment just getting your neighborhood to change these things than by changing your vehicle. Thank you very much. So  I've known a lot of fish in my life. I've loved only two. That first one  it was more like a passionate affair. It was a beautiful fish  flavorful  textured  meaty  a bestseller on the menu. What a fish. Even better  it was farm raised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability. So you could feel good about selling it. I was in a relationship with this beauty for several months. One day  the head of the company called and asked if I'd speak at an event about the farm's sustainability.  Absolutely   I said. Here was a company trying to solve what's become this unimaginable problem for us chefs  How do we keep fish on our menus  For the past    years  we've been fishing the seas like we clear cut forests. It's hard to overstate the destruction. Ninety percent of large fish  the ones we love    the tunas  the halibuts  the salmons  swordfish    they've collapsed. There's almost nothing left. So  for better or for worse  aquaculture  fish farming  is going to be a part of our future. A lot of arguments against it  Fish farms pollute    most of them do anyway    and they're inefficient. Take tuna  a major drawback. It's got a feed conversion ratio of    to one. That means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna. Not very sustainable. It doesn't taste very good either. So here  finally  was a company trying to do it right. I wanted to support them. The day before the event  I called the head of P.R. for the company. Let's call him Don.  Don   I said   just to get the facts straight  you guys are famous for farming so far out to sea  you don't pollute.   That's right   he said.  We're so far out  the waste from our fish gets distributed  not concentrated.  And then he added   We're basically a world unto ourselves. That feed conversion ratio   .  to one   he said.  Best in the business.   .  to one  great.   .  what  What are you feeding    Sustainable proteins   he said.  Great   I said. Got off the phone. And that night  I was lying in bed  and I thought  What the hell is a sustainable protein  So the next day  just before the event  I called Don. I said   Don  what are some examples of sustainable proteins   He said he didn't know. He would ask around. Well  I got on the phone with a few people in the company  no one could give me a straight answer until finally  I got on the phone with the head biologist. Let's call him Don too.  Don   I said   what are some examples of sustainable proteins   Well  he mentioned some algaes and some fish meals  and then he said chicken pellets. I said   Chicken pellets   He said   Yeah  feathers  skin  bone meal  scraps  dried and processed into feed.  I said   What percentage of your feed is chicken   Thinking  you know  two percent.  Well  it's about    percent   he said. I said   Don  what's sustainable about feeding chicken to fish   There was a long pause on the line  and he said   There's just too much chicken in the world.  I fell out of love with this fish. No  not because I'm some self righteous  goody two shoes foodie. I actually am. No  I actually fell out of love with this fish because  I swear to God  after that conversation  the fish tasted like chicken. This second fish  it's a different kind of love story. It's the romantic kind  the kind where the more you get to know your fish  you love the fish. I first ate it at a restaurant in southern Spain. A journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time. She kind of set us up. It came to the table a bright  almost shimmering  white color. The chef had overcooked it. Like twice over. Amazingly  it was still delicious. Who can make a fish taste good after it's been overcooked  I can't  but this guy can. Let's call him Miguel    actually his name is Miguel. And no  he didn't cook the fish  and he's not a chef  at least in the way that you and I understand it. He's a biologist at Veta La Palma. It's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain. It's at the tip of the Guadalquivir river. Until the     s  the farm was in the hands of the Argentinians. They raised beef cattle on what was essentially wetlands. They did it by draining the land. They built this intricate series of canals  and they pushed water off the land and out into the river. Well  they couldn't make it work  not economically. And ecologically  it was a disaster. It killed like    percent of the birds  which  for this place  is a lot of birds. And so in       a Spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land. What did they do  They reversed the flow of water. They literally flipped the switch. Instead of pushing water out  they used the channels to pull water back in. They flooded the canals. They created a        acre fish farm    bass  mullet  shrimp  eel    and in the process  Miguel and this company completely reversed the ecological destruction. The farm's incredible. I mean  you've never seen anything like this. You stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away  and all you see are flooded canals and this thick  rich marshland. I was there not long ago with Miguel. He's an amazing guy  like three parts Charles Darwin and one part Crocodile Dundee. Okay  There we are slogging through the wetlands  and I'm panting and sweating  got mud up to my knees  and Miguel's calmly conducting a biology lecture. Here  he's pointing out a rare Black shouldered Kite. Now  he's mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton. And here  here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the Tanzanian Giraffe. It turns out  Miguel spent the better part of his career in the Mikumi National Park in Africa. I asked him how he became such an expert on fish. He said   Fish  I didn't know anything about fish. I'm an expert in relationships.  And then he's off  launching into more talk about rare birds and algaes and strange aquatic plants. And don't get me wrong  that was really fascinating  you know  the biotic community unplugged  kind of thing. It's great  but I was in love. And my head was swooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish I had the night before. So I interrupted him. I said   Miguel  what makes your fish taste so good   He pointed at the algae.  I know  dude  the algae  the phytoplankton  the relationships  It's amazing. But what are your fish eating  What's the feed conversion ratio   Well  he goes on to tell me it's such a rich system that the fish are eating what they'd be eating in the wild. The plant biomass  the phytoplankton  the zooplankton  it's what feeds the fish. The system is so healthy  it's totally self renewing. There is no feed. Ever heard of a farm that doesn't feed its animals  Later that day  I was driving around this property with Miguel  and I asked him  I said   For a place that seems so natural  unlike like any farm I'd ever been at  how do you measure success   At that moment  it was as if a film director called for a set change. And we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight  thousands and thousands of pink flamingos  a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see.  That's success   he said.  Look at their bellies  pink. They're feasting.  Feasting  I was totally confused. I said   Miguel  aren't they feasting on your fish    Yes   he said.  We lose    percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds. Well  last year  this property had         birds on it  more than     different species. It's become  today  the largest and one of the most important private bird sanctuaries in all of Europe.  I said   Miguel  isn't a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm   He shook his head  no. He said   We farm extensively  not intensively. This is an ecological network. The flamingos eat the shrimp. The shrimp eat the phytoplankton. So the pinker the belly  the better the system.  Okay  so let's review  a farm that doesn't feed its animals  and a farm that measures its success on the health of its predators. A fish farm  but also a bird sanctuary. Oh  and by the way  those flamingos  they shouldn't even be there in the first place. They brood in a town     miles away  where the soil conditions are better for building nests. Every morning  they fly     miles into the farm. And every evening  they fly     miles back. They do that because they're able to follow the broken white line of highway A  . No kidding. I was imagining a  March of the Penguins  thing  so I looked at Miguel. I said   Miguel  do they fly     miles to the farm  and then do they fly     miles back at night  Do they do that for the children   He looked at me like I had just quoted a Whitney Houston song. He said   No  they do it because the food's better.  I didn't mention the skin of my beloved fish  which was delicious    and I don't like fish skin  I don't like it seared  I don't like it crispy. It's that acrid  tar like flavor. I almost never cook with it. Yet  when I tasted it at that restaurant in southern Spain  it tasted not at all like fish skin. It tasted sweet and clean  like you were taking a bite of the ocean. I mentioned that to Miguel  and he nodded. He said   The skin acts like a sponge. It's the last defense before anything enters the body. It evolved to soak up impurities.  And then he added   But our water has no impurities.  OK. A farm that doesn't feed its fish  a farm that measures its success by the success of its predators. And then I realized when he says   A farm that has no impurities   he made a big understatement  because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the Guadalquivir River. It's a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days  chemical contaminants  pesticide runoff. And when it works its way through the system and leaves  the water is cleaner than when it entered. The system is so healthy  it purifies the water. So  not just a farm that doesn't feed its animals  not just a farm that measures its success by the health of its predators  but a farm that's literally a water purification plant    and not just for those fish  but for you and me as well. Because when that water leaves  it dumps out into the Atlantic. A drop in the ocean  I know  but I'll take it  and so should you  because this love story  however romantic  is also instructive. You might say it's a recipe for the future of good food  whether we're talking about bass or beef cattle. What we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture  one in which the food actually tastes good. But for a lot people  that's a bit too radical. We're not realists  us foodies  we're lovers. We love farmers' markets  we love small family farms  we talk about local food  we eat organic. And when you suggest these are the things that will ensure the future of good food  someone  somewhere stands up and says   Hey guy  I love pink flamingos  but how are you going to feed the world   How are you going to feed the world  Can I be honest  I don't love that question. No  not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world. One billion people will go hungry today. One billion    that's more than ever before    because of gross inequalities in distribution  not tonnage. Now  I don't love this question because it's determined the logic of our food system for the last    years. Feed grain to herbivores  pesticides to monocultures  chemicals to soil  chicken to fish  and all along agribusiness has simply asked   If we're feeding more people more cheaply  how terrible could that be   That's been the motivation  it's been the justification  it's been the business plan of American agriculture. We should call it what it is  a business in liquidation  a business that's quickly eroding ecological capital that makes that very production possible. That's not a business  and it isn't agriculture. Our breadbasket is threatened today  not because of diminishing supply  but because of diminishing resources. Not by the latest combine and tractor invention  but by fertile land  not by pumps  but by fresh water  not by chainsaws  but by forests  and not by fishing boats and nets  but by fish in the sea. Want to feed the world  Let's start by asking  How are we going to feed ourselves  Or better  How can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself  To do that  don't look at the agribusiness model for the future. It's really old  and it's tired. It's high on capital  chemistry and machines  and it's never produced anything really good to eat. Instead  let's look to the ecological model. That's the one that relies on two billion years of on the job experience. Look to Miguel  farmers like Miguel. Farms that aren't worlds unto themselves  farms that restore instead of deplete  farms that farm extensively instead of just intensively  farmers that are not just producers  but experts in relationships. Because they're the ones that are experts in flavor  too. And if I'm going to be really honest  they're a better chef than I'll ever be. You know  I'm okay with that  because if that's the future of good food  it's going to be delicious. Thank you. For some time I have been interested in the placebo effect  which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in  unless you think of it in the terms that I do  which is   Something fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real.  In other words  sugar pills have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies  the placebo effect  just because the person thinks that what's happening to them is a pharmaceutical or some sort of a    for pain management  for example  if they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect. Something fake becomes something real because of someone's perception of it. In order for us to understand each other  I want to start by showing you a rudimentary  very simple magic trick. And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a trick that's been in every children's magic book since at least the     s. I learned it myself from Cub Scout Magic in the     s. I'll do it for you  and then I'll explain it. And then I'll explain why I explained it. So  here's what happens. The knife  which you can examine  my hand  which you could examine. I'm just going to hold the knife in my fist like this. I'll get my sleeve back. And to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve I'm just going to squeeze my wrist right here. That way you can see that at no time can anything travel  as long as I'm squeezing there nothing can go up or down my sleeve. And the object of this is quite simple. I'm going to open my hand  and hopefully  if all is well  my pure animal magnetism will hold the knife. In fact it's held so tightly in place that I can shake it  and the knife does not come off. Nothing goes up or down my sleeve  no trickery. And you can examine everything. Ta da  So  this is a trick that I often teach to young children that are interested in magic  because you can learn a great deal about deception by studying this very    even though it's a very simple trick methodologically. Probably many of you in the room know this trick. What happens is this. I hold the knife in my hand. I say I'm going to grab hold of my wrist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve  that is a lie. The reason I'm holding onto my wrist is because that's actually the secret of the illusion. In a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you  this finger right here  my index finger is just going to shift from where it is  to a position pointing out like this. Nice one. Someone who didn't have a childhood is out there. So  it goes like this  from here  right. And as I move around my finger shifts. And we could talk about why this is deceptive  why you don't notice there are only three fingers down here  because the mind  and the way it processes information  it doesn't count  one  two  three. It groups them. But that's not really what this is about. Right  And then I open my hand up. Obviously it's clinging there  not by animal magnetism  but by chicanery  my index finger being there. And then when I close my finger  same thing  as I move back  this motion kind of covers the moving back of my finger. I take this hand away. You give the knife out. There is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors. Thanks. Now   Laughter  what does that have to do with the placebo effect  I read a study a year or so ago that really blew my mind wide open. I'm not a doctor or a researcher  so this  to me  was an astonishing thing. It turns out that if you administer a placebo in the form of a white pill  that's like aspirin shaped    it's just a round white pill    it has some certain measurable effect. But if you change the form that you give the placebo in  like you make a smaller pill  and color it blue  and stamp a letter into it  it is actually measurably more effective. Even though neither one of these things has any pharmaceutical    they're sugar pills. But a white pill is not as good as a blue pill. What   Laughter  That really flipped me out. Turns out though  that that's not even where it stops. If you have capsules  they're more effective than tablets in any form. A colored capsule  that's yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white capsule. Dosage has something to do with this. One pill twice a day is not as good at three pills    I don't remember the statistic now. Sorry. But the point is ... And the form has something to do with it. And if you want the ultimate in placebo  you've go to the needle. Right  A syringe with some inert    a couple CCs of some inert something  and you inject this into a patient ... Well this is such a powerful image in their mind  it's so much stronger than the white pill. It's a really  this graph  well I'll show it to you some other time when we have slides. The point is the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle. And none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality  it's only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a stronger effect. I wanted to see if I could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick. And take something that is obviously a fake trick and make it seem real. And we know from that study that when you want reality  you go to the needle. This is a seven inch hatpin. It's very  very sharp  and I'm going to just sterilize it a tiny bit. This is really my flesh. This is not Damian's special grown flesh. That's my skin right there. This is not a Hollywood special effect. I'm going to pierce my skin and run this needle through to the other side. If you're queasy     Laughs  if you faint easily    I was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night  and some people that I didn't know  and one woman almost passed out. So  I suggest if you get queasy easy that you look away for about the next       in fact  you know what  I'll do the first bad part behind it. You'll get to see  you can look away too if you'd like to. So  here is what happens  right here  the beginning of my flesh at the lower part of my arm I just make a little pierce. I'm sorry  man. Am I freaking you out  OK  and then just through my skin a tiny bit  and then out the other side like this. Now  essentially we're in the same position we were in with the knife trick. Sort of. But you can't count my fingers right now can you  So  let me show them to you. That's one  two three  four  five. Yes  well... I know what people think when they see this. They go   Well  he's certainly not dumb enough to stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes. So  let me give you a little peek. How's that look out there  Pretty good. Yeah  I know.  Laughs  And the people in the back go   OK  I didn't really see that.  People in the satellite room are starting to move in now. Let me give you good close look at this. That really is my skin. That is not a Hollywood special effect. That's my flesh  and I can twist that around. I'm sorry. If you're getting queasy  look away  don't look at the thing. People in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go   Well yeah  that looks kind of neat in some sort of effect there  but if it were real he would be    see there's a hole there and a hole there  if it were real he would be bleeding. Well let me work up some blood for you. Yes  there it is. Normally now  I would take the needle out. I would clean off my arm  and I would show you that there are no wounds. But I think in this context and with the idea of taking something fake and making it into something real  I'm just going to leave it there  and walk off the stage. I will be seeing you several times over the next few days. I hope you're looking forward to that. Thank you very much. I'm going to talk to you today about my work on suspended animation. Now  usually when I mention suspended animation  people will flash me the Vulcan sign and laugh. But now  I'm not talking about gorking people out to fly to Mars or even Pandora  as much fun as that may be. I'm talking about the concept of using suspended animation to help people out in trauma. So what do I mean when I say  suspended animation   It is the process by which animals de animate  appear dead and then can wake up again without being harmed. OK  so here is the sort of big idea  If you look out at nature  you find that as you tend to see suspended animation  you tend to see immortality. And so  what I'm going to tell you about is a way to tell a person who's in trauma    find a way to de animate them a bit so they're a little more immortal when they have that heart attack. An example of an organism or two that happens to be quite immortal would be plant seeds or bacterial spores. These creatures are some of the most immortal life forms on our planet  and they tend to spend most of their time in suspended animation. Bacterial spores are thought now by scientists to exist as individual cells that are alive  but in suspended animation for as long as     million years. To suggest that this all  sort of  about little  tiny creatures  I want to bring it close to home. In the immortal germ line of human beings    that is  the eggs that sit in the ovaries    they actually sit there in a state of suspended animation for up to    years in the life of each woman. So then there's also my favorite example of suspended animation. This is Sea Monkeys. Those of you with children  you know about them. You go to the pet store or the toy store  and you can buy these things. You just open the bag  and you just dump them into the plastic aquarium  and in about a week or so  you'll have little shrimps swimming around. Well  I wasn't so interested in the swimming. I was interested in what was going on in the bag  the bag on the toy store shelf where those shrimp sat in suspended animation indefinitely. So these ideas of suspended animation are not just about cells and weird  little organisms. Occasionally  human beings are briefly de animated  and the stories of people who are briefly de animated that interest me the most are those having to do with the cold. Ten years ago  there was a skier in Norway that was trapped in an icy waterfall  and she was there for two hours before they extracted her. She was extremely cold  and she had no heartbeat    for all intents and purposes she was dead  frozen. Seven hours later  still without a heartbeat  they brought her back to life  and she went on to be the head radiologist in the hospital that treated her. A couple of years later    so I get really excited about these things    about a couple of years later  there was a    month old  she was from Canada. Her father had gone out in the wintertime  he was working night shift  and she followed him outside in nothing but a diaper. And they found her hours later  frozen  lifeless  and they brought her back to life. There was a    year old woman in Duluth  Minnesota last year that was found frozen and without a pulse in her front yard one morning in the winter  and they brought her back to life. The next day  she was doing so well  they wanted to run tests on her. She got cranky and just went home. So  these are miracles  right  These are truly miraculous things that happen. Doctors have a saying that  in fact   You're not dead until you're warm and dead.  And it's true. It's true. In the New England Journal of Medicine  there was a study published that showed that with appropriate rewarming  people who had suffered without a heartbeat for three hours could be brought back to life without any neurologic problems. That's over    percent. So what I was trying to do is think of a way that we could study suspended animation to think about a way to reproduce  maybe  what happened to the skier. Well  I have to tell you something very odd  and that is that being exposed to low oxygen does not always kill. So  in this room  there's    percent oxygen or so  and if we reduce the oxygen concentration  we will all be dead. And  in fact  the animals we were working with in the lab    these little garden worms  nematodes    they were also dead when we exposed them to low oxygen. And here's the thing that should freak you out. And that is that  when we lower the oxygen concentration further by     times  to    parts per million  they were not dead  they were in suspended animation  and we could bring them back to life without any harm. And this precise oxygen concentration     parts per million  that caused suspended animation  is conserved. We can see it in a variety of different organisms. One of the creatures we see it in is a fish. And we can turn its heartbeat on and off by going in and out of suspended animation like you would a light switch. So this was pretty shocking to me  that we could do this. And so I was wondering  when we were trying to reproduce the work with the skier  that we noticed that  of course  she had no oxygen consumption  and so maybe she was in a similar state of suspended animation. But  of course  she was also extremely cold. So we wondered what would happen if we took our suspended animals and exposed them to the cold. And so  what we found out was that  if you take animals that are animated like you and I  and you make them cold    that is  these were the garden worms    now they're dead. But if you have them in suspended animation  and move them into the cold  they're all alive. And there's the very important thing there  If you want to survive the cold  you ought to be suspended. Right  It's a really good thing. And so  we were thinking about that  about this relationship between these things  and thinking about whether or not that's what happened to the skier. And so we wondered  Might there be some agent that is in us  something that we make ourselves  that we might be able to regulate our own metabolic flexibility in such a way as to be able to survive when we got extremely cold  and might otherwise pass away  I thought it might be interesting to sort of hunt for such things. You know  I should mention briefly here that physiology textbooks that you can read about will tell you that this is a kind of heretical thing to suggest. We have  from the time we are slapped on the butt until we take our last dying breath    that's when we're newborn to when we're dead    we cannot reduce our metabolic rate below what's called a standard  or basal metabolic rate. But I knew that there were examples of creatures  also mammals  that do reduce their metabolic rate such as ground squirrels and bears  they reduce their metabolic rate in the wintertime when they hibernate. So I wondered  Might we be able to find some agent or trigger that might induce such a state in us  And so  we went looking for such things. And this was a period of time when we failed tremendously. Ken Robinson is here. He talked about the glories of failure. Well  we had a lot of them. We tried many different chemicals and agents  and we failed over and over again. So  one time  I was at home watching television on the couch while my wife was putting our child to bed  and I was watching a television show. It was a television show    it was a NOVA show on PBS    about caves in New Mexico. And this particular cave was Lechuguilla  and this cave is incredibly toxic to humans. The researchers had to suit up just to enter it. It's filled with this toxic gas  hydrogen sulfide. Now  hydrogen sulfide is curiously present in us. We make it ourselves. The highest concentration is in our brains. Yet  it was used as a chemical warfare agent in World War I. It's an extraordinarily toxic thing. In fact  in chemical accidents  hydrogen sulfide is known to    if you breathe too much of it  you collapse to the ground  you appear dead  but if you were brought out into room air  you can be reanimated without harm  if they do that quickly. So  I thought   Wow  I have to get some of this.  Now  it's post      America  and when you go into the research institute  and you say   Hi. I'd like to buy some concentrated  compressed gas cylinders of a lethal gas because I have these ideas  see  about wanting to suspend people. It's really going to be OK.  So that's kind of a tough day  but I said   There really is some basis for thinking why you might want to do this.  As I said  this agent is in us  and  in fact  here's a curious thing  it binds to the very place inside of your cells where oxygen binds  and where you burn it  and that you do this burning to live. And so we thought  like in a game of musical chairs  might we be able to give a person some hydrogen sulfide  and might it be able to occupy that place like in a game of musical chairs where oxygen might bind  And because you can't bind the oxygen  maybe you wouldn't consume it  and then maybe it would reduce your demand for oxygen. I mean  who knows  So     Laughter  So  there's the bit about the dopamine and being a little bit  what do you call it  delusional  and you might suggest that was it. And so  we wanted to find out might we be able to use hydrogen sulfide in the presence of cold  and we wanted to see whether we could reproduce this skier in a mammal. Now  mammals are warm blooded creatures  and when we get cold  we shake and we shiver  right  We try to keep our core temperature at    degrees by actually burning more oxygen. So  it was interesting for us when we applied hydrogen sulfide to a mouse when it was also cold because what happened is the core temperature of the mouse got cold. It stopped moving. It appeared dead. Its oxygen consumption rate fell by tenfold. And here's the really important point. I told you hydrogen sulfide is in us. It's rapidly metabolized  and all you have to do after six hours of being in this state of de animation is simply put the thing out in room air  and it warms up  and it's none the worse for wear. Now  this was cosmic. Really. Because we had found a way to de animate a mammal  and it didn't hurt it. Now  we'd found a way to reduce its oxygen consumption to rock bottom levels  and it was fine. Now  in this state of de animation  it could not go out dancing  but it was not dead  and it was not harmed. So we started to think  Is this the agent that might have been present in the skier  and might have she had more of it than someone else  and might that have been able to reduce her demand for oxygen before she got so cold that she otherwise would have died  as we found out with our worm experiments  So  we wondered  Can we do anything useful with this capacity to control metabolic flexibility  And one of the things we wondered    I'm sure some of you out there are economists  and you know all about supply and demand. And when supply is equal to demand  everything's fine  but when supply falls  in this case of oxygen  and demand stays high  you're dead. So  what I just told you is we can now reduce demand. We ought to be able to lower supply to unprecedented low levels without killing the animal. And with money we got from DARPA  we could show just that. If you give mice hydrogen sulfide  you can lower their demand for oxygen  and you can put them into oxygen concentrations that are as low as       feet above the top of Mt. Everest  and they can sit there for hours  and there's no problem. Well this was really cool. We also found out that we could subject animals to otherwise lethal blood loss  and we could save them if we gave them hydrogen sulfide. So these proof of concept experiments led me to say  I should found a company  and we should take this out to a wider playing field.  I founded a company called Ikaria with others' help. And this company  the first thing it did was make a liquid formulation of hydrogen sulfide an injectable form that we could put in and send it out to physician scientists all over the world who work on models of critical care medicine  and the results are incredibly positive. In one model of heart attack  animals given hydrogen sulfide showed a    percent reduction in heart damage compared to those who got the standard of care that you and I would receive if we were to have a heart attack here today. Same is true for organ failure  when you have loss of function owing to poor perfusion of kidney  of liver  acute respiratory distress syndrome and damage suffered in cardiac bypass surgery. So  these are the thought leaders in trauma medicine all over the world saying this is true  so it seems that exposure to hydrogen sulfide decreases damage that you receive from being exposed to otherwise lethal low oxygen. And I should say that the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide required to get this benefit are low  incredibly low. In fact  so low that physicians will not have to lower or dim the metabolism of people much at all to see the benefit I just mentioned  which is a wonderful thing  if you're thinking about adopting this. You don't want to be gorking people out just to save them  it's really confusing. So  I want to say that we're in human trials. Now  and so    Thank you. The Phase   safety studies are over  and we're doing fine  we're now moved on. We have to get to Phase   and Phase  . It's going to take us a few years. This has all moved very quickly  and the mouse experiments of hibernating mice happened in       the first human studies were done in       and we should know in a couple of years whether it works or not. And this all happened really quickly because of a lot of help from a lot of people. I want to mention that  first of all  my wife  without whom this talk and my work would not be possible  so thank you very much. Also  the brilliant scientists who work at my lab and also others on staff  the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle  Washington    wonderful place to work. And also the wonderful scientists and businesspeople at Ikaria. One thing those people did out there was take this technology of hydrogen sulfide  which is this start up company that's burning venture capital very quickly  and they fused it with another company that sells another toxic gas that's more toxic than hydrogen sulfide  and they give it to newborn babies who would otherwise die from a failure to be able to oxygenate their tissues properly. And this gas that is delivered in over a thousand critical care hospitals worldwide  now is approved  on label  and saves thousands of babies a year from certain death. So it's really incredible for me to be a part of this. And I want to say that I think we're on the path of understanding metabolic flexibility in a fundamental way  and that in the not too distant future  an EMT might give an injection of hydrogen sulfide  or some related compound  to a person suffering severe injuries  and that person might de animate a bit  they might become a little more immortal. Their metabolism will fall as though you were dimming a switch on a lamp at home. And then  they will have the time  that will buy them the time  to be transported to the hospital to get the care they need. And then  after they get that care    like the mouse  like the skier  like the    year old woman    they'll wake up. A miracle  We hope not  or maybe we just hope to make miracles a little more common. Thank you very much. If you think about the phone    and Intel has tested a lot of the things I'm going to show you  over the last    years  in about     elderly households        in Ireland  and     in Portland    trying to understand  How do we measure and monitor behavior in a medically meaningful way  And if you think about the phone  right  it's something that we can use for some incredible ways to help people actually take the right medication at the right time. We're testing these kinds of simple sensor network technologies in the home so that any phone that a senior is already comfortable with can help them deal with their medications. And a lot of what they do is they pick up the phone  and it's our system whispering to them which pill they need to take  and they fake like they're having a conversation with a friend. And they're not embarrassed by a meds caddy that's ugly  that sits on their kitchen table and says   I'm old. I'm frail.  It's surreptitious technology that's helping them do a simple task of taking the right pill at the right time. Now  we also do some pretty amazing things with these phones. Because that moment when you answer the phone is a cognitive test every time that you do it. Think about it  all right  I'm going to answer the phone three different times.  Hello  Hey.  All right  That's the first time.  Hello  Uh  hey.   Hello  Uh  who  Oh  hey.  All right  Very big differences between the way I answered the phone the three times. And as we monitor phone usage by seniors over a long period of time  down to the tenths of a microsecond  that recognition moment of whether they can figure out that person on the other end is a friend and we start talking to them immediately  or they do a lot of what's called trouble talk  where they're like   Wait  who is this  Oh.  Right  Waiting for that recognition moment may be the best early indicator of the onset of dementia than anything that shows up clinically today. We call these behavioral markers. There's lots of others. Is the person going to the phone as quickly  when it rings  as they used to  Is it a hearing problem or is it a physicality problem  Has their voice gotten more quiet  We're doing a lot of work with people with Alzheimer's and particularly with Parkinson's  where that quiet voice that sometimes shows up with Parkinson's patients may be the best early indicator of Parkinson's five to    years before it shows up clinically. But those subtle changes in your voice over a long period of time are hard for you or your spouse to notice until it becomes so extreme and your voice has become so quiet. So  sensors are looking at that kind of voice. When you pick up the phone  how much tremor are you having  and what is that like  and what is that trend like over a period of time  Are you having more trouble dialing the phone than you used to  Is it a dexterity problem  Is it the onset of arthritis  Are you using the phone  Are you socializing less than you used to  And looking at that pattern. And what does that decline in social health mean  as a kind of a vital sign of the future  And then wow  what a radical idea  we    except in the United States    might be able to use this newfangled technology to actually interact with a nurse or a doctor on the other end of the line. Wow  what a great day that will be once we're allowed to actually do those kinds of things. So  these are what I would call behavioral markers. And it's the whole field that we've been trying to work on for the last    years at Intel. How do you put simple disruptive technologies  and the first of five phrases that I'm going to talk about in this talk  Behavioral markers matter. How do we change behavior  How do we measure changes in behavior in a meaningful way that's going to help us with prevention of disease  early onset of disease  and tracking the progression of disease over a long period of time  Now  why would Intel let me spend a lot of time and money  over the last    years  trying to understand the needs of seniors and start thinking about these kinds of behavioral markers  This is some of the field work that we've done. We have now lived with       elderly households in    countries over the last    years. We study people in Rochester  New York. We go live with them in the winter because what they do in the winter  and their access to healthcare  and how much they socialize  is very different than in the summer. If they have a hip fracture we go with them and we study their entire discharge experience. If they have a family member who is a key part of their care network  we fly and study them as well. So  we study the holistic health experience of       seniors over the last    years in    different countries. Why is Intel willing to fund that  It's because of the second slogan that I want to talk about. Ten years ago  when I started trying to convince Intel to let me go start looking at disruptive technologies that could help with independent living  this is what I called it   Y K     .  You know  back in       we were all so obsessed with paying attention to the aging of our computers  and whether or not they were going to survive the tick of the clock from      to       that we missed a moment that only demographers were paying attention to. It was right around New Years. And that switchover  when we had the larger number of older people on the planet  for the first time than younger people. For the first time in human history    and barring aliens landing or some major other pandemic  that's the expectation from demographers  going forward. And    years ago it seemed like I had a lot of time to convince Intel to work on this. Right  Y K      was coming  the baby boomers starting to retire. Well folks  it's like we know these demographics here. This is a map of the entire world. It's like the lights are on  but nobody's home on this demographic Y K      problem. Right  I mean we sort of get it here  but we don't get it here  and we're not doing anything about it. The health reform bill is largely ignoring the realities of the age wave that's coming  and the implications for what we need to do to change not only how we pay for care  but deliver care in some radically different ways. And in fact  it's upon us. I mean you probably saw these headlines. This is Catherine Casey who is the first boomer to actually get Social Security. That actually occurred this year. She took early retirement. She was born one second after midnight in     . A retired school teacher  there she is with a Social Security administrator. The first boomer actually  we didn't even wait till       next year. We're already starting to see early retirement occur this year. All right  so it's here. This Y K      problem is at our door. This is    tsunamis scheduled on the calendar  but somehow we can't sort of marshal our government and innovative forces to sort of get out in front of it and do something about it. We'll wait until it's more of a catastrophe  and react  as opposed to prepare for it. So  one of the reasons it's so challenging to prepare for this Y K problem is  I want to argue  we have what I would call mainframe poisoning. Andy Grove  about six or seven years ago  he doesn't even know or remember this  in a Fortune Magazine article he used the phrase  mainframe healthcare   and I've been extending and expanding this. He saw it written down somewhere. He's like   Eric that's a really cool concept.  I was like   Actually it was your idea. You said it in a Fortune Magazine article. I just extended it.  You know  this is the mainframe. This mentality of traveling to and timesharing large  expensive healthcare systems actually began in     . This is the first general hospital in Vienna. And actually the second general hospital in Vienna  in about       was where we started to build out an entire curriculum for teaching med students specialties. And it's a place in which we started developing architecture that literally divided the body  and divided care into departments and compartments. And it was reflected in our architecture  it was reflected in the way that we taught students  and this mainframe mentality persists today. Now  I'm not anti hospital. With my own healthcare problems  I've taken drug therapies  I've traveled to this hospital and others  many  many times. But we worship the high hospital on a hill. Right  And this is mainframe healthcare. And just as    years ago we couldn't conceive that we would have the power of a mainframe computer that took up a room this size in our purses and on our belts  that we're carrying around in our cell phone today  and suddenly  computing  that used to be an expert driven system  it was a personal system that we all owned as part of our daily lives    that shift from mainframe to personal computing is what we have to do for healthcare. We have to shift from this mainframe mentality of healthcare to a personal model of healthcare. We are obsessed with this way of thinking. When Intel does surveys all around the world and we say   Quick response  healthcare.  The first word that comes up is  doctor.  The second that comes up is  hospital.  And the third is  illness  or  sickness.  Right  We are wired  in our imagination  to think about healthcare and healthcare innovation as something that goes into that place. Our entire health reform discussion right now  health I.T.  when we talk with policy makers  equals  How are we going to get doctors using electronic medical records in the mainframe   We're not thinking about how do we shift from the mainframe to the home. And the problem with this is the way we conceive healthcare. Right  This is a very reactive  crisis driven system. We're doing    minute exams with patients. It's population based. We collect a bunch of biological information in this artificial setting  and we fix them up  like Humpty Dumpty all over again  and send them home  and hope    we might hand them a brochure  maybe an interactive website    that they do as asked and don't come back into the mainframe. And the problem is we can't afford it today  folks. We can't afford mainframe healthcare today to include the uninsured. And now we want to do a double double of the age wave coming through  Business as usual in healthcare is broken and we've got to do something different. We've got to focus on the home. We've got to focus on a personal healthcare paradigm that moves care to the home. How do we be more proactive  prevention driven  How do we collect vital signs and other kinds of information    by    How do we get a personal baseline about what's going to work for you  How do we collect not just biological data but behavioral data  psychological data  relational data  in and on and around the home  And how do we drive compliance to be a customized care plan that uses all this great technology that's around us to change our behavior  That's what we need to do for our personal health model. I want to give you a couple of examples. This is Mimi from one of our studies    in her   s  had to move out of her home because her family was worried about falls. Raise your hand if you had a serious fall in your household  or any of your loved ones  your parents or so forth. Right  Classic. Hip fracture often leads to institutionalization of a senior. This is what was happening to Mimi  the family was worried about it  moved her out of her own home into an assisted living facility. She tripped over her oxygen tank. Many people in this generation won't press the button  even if they have an alert call system  because they don't want to bother anybody  even though they've been paying    dollars a month. Boomers will press the button. Trust me. They're going to be pressing that button non stop. Right  Mimi broke her pelvis  lay all night  all morning  finally somebody came in and found her  sent her to the hospital. They fixed her back up. She was never going to be able to move back into the assisted living. They put her into the nursing home unit. First night in the nursing home unit where she had been in the same assisted living facility  moved her from one bed to another  kind of threw her  rebroke her pelvis  sent her back to the hospital that she had just come from  no one read the chart  put her on Tylenol  which she is allergic to  broke out  got bedsores  basically  had heart problems  and died from the fall and the complications and the errors that were there. Now  the most frightening thing about this is this is my wife's grandmother. Now  I'm Eric Dishman. I speak English  I work for Intel  I make a good salary  I'm smart about falls and fall related injuries    it's an area of research that I work on. I have access to senators and CEOs. I can't stop this from happening. What happens if you don't have money  you don't speak English or don't have the kind of access to deal with these kinds of problems that inevitably occur  How do we actually prevent the vast majority of falls from ever occurring in the first place  Let me give you a quick example of work that we're doing to try to do exactly that. I've been wearing a little technology that we call Shimmer. It's a research platform. It has accelerometry. You can plug in a three lead ECG. There is all kinds of sort of plug and play kind of Legos that you can do to capture  in the wild  in the real world  things like tremor  gait  stride length and those kinds of things. The problem is  our understanding of falls today  like Mimi  is get a survey in the mail three months after you fell  from the State  saying   What were you doing when you fell   That's sort of the state of the art. But with something like Shimmer  or we have something called the Magic Carpet  embedded sensors in carpet  or camera based systems that we borrowed from sports medicine  we're starting for the first time in those     elderly households to collect actual kinematic motion data to understand  What are the subtle changes that are occurring that can show us that mom has become risk at falls  And most often we can do two interventions  fix the meds mix. I'm a qualitative researcher  but when I look at these data streams coming in from these homes  I can look at the data and tell you the day that some doctor prescribed them something that nobody else knew that they were on  because we see the changes in their patterns in the household. Right  These discoveries of behavioral markers  and behavioral changes are game changing  and like the discovery of the microscope because of our collecting data streams that we've actually never done before. This is an example in our TRIL Clinic in Ireland of    actually what you're seeing is she's looking at data  in this picture  from the Magic Carpet. So  we have a little carpet that you can look at your amount of postural sway  and look at the changes in your postural sway over many months. Here's what some of this data might look like. This is actually sensor firings. These are two different subjects in our study. It's about a year's worth of data. The color represents different rooms they are in the house. This person on the left is living in their own home. This person on the right is actually living in an assisted living facility. I know this because look at how punctuated meal time is when they are no longer in their particular rooms here. Right  Now  this doesn't mean that much to you. But when we look at these cycles of data over a longer period of time    and we're looking at everything from motion around different rooms in the house  to sort of micro motions that Shimmer picks up  about gait and stride length    these streams of data are starting to tell us things about behavioral patterns that we've never understood before. You can go to ORCATech.org    it has nothing to do with whales  it's the Oregon Center for Aging and Technology    to see more about that. The problem is  Intel is still one of the largest funders in the world of independent living technology research. I'm not bragging about how much we fund  it's how little anyone else actually pays attention to aging and funds innovation on aging  chronic disease management and independent living in the home. So  my mantra here  my fourth slogan is         households or bust. We need to drive a national  if not international  Framingham type heart study of independent living technologies  where we have        elderly connected households with broadband  full medical characterization  and a platform by which we can start to experiment and turn these from    household anecdotal studies that the universities fund  to large clinical trials that prove out the value of these technologies. So         households or bust. These are just some of the households that we've done in the Intel studies. My fifth and final phrase  I have tried for two years  and there were moments when we were quite close  to make this healthcare reform bill be about reform from something and to something  from a mainframe model to a personal health model  or to mean something more than just a debate about the public option and how we're going to finance. It doesn't matter how we finance healthcare. We're going to figure something out for the next    years  and try it. No matter who pays for it  we better start doing care in a fundamentally different way and treating the home and the patient and the family member and the caregivers as part of these coordinated care teams and using disruptive technologies that are already here to do care in some pretty fundamental different ways. The president needs to stand up and say  at the end of a healthcare reform debate   Our goal as a country is to move    percent of care out of institutions  clinics  hospitals and nursing homes  to the home  in    years.  It's achievable. We should do it economically  we should do it morally  and we should do it for quality of life. But there is no goal within this health reform. It's just a mess today. So  you know  that's my last message to you. How do we set a going to the moon goal of dealing with the Y K     problem that's coming  It's not that innovation and technology is going to be the magic pill that cures all  but it's going to be part of the solution. And if we don't create a personal health movement  something that we're all aiming towards in reform  then we're going to move nowhere. So  I hope you'll turn this conference into that kind of movement forward. Thanks very much. I'm Jane McGonigal. I'm a game designer. I've been making games online now for    years  and my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games. Now  I have a plan for this  and it entails convincing more people  including all of you  to spend more time playing bigger and better games. Right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games. Some of you might be thinking   That's a lot of time to spend playing games. Maybe too much time  considering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world.  But actually  according to my research at the Institute for the Future  actually the opposite is true. Three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world's most urgent problems. In fact  I believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet  we need to increase that total dramatically. I've calculated the total we need at    billion hours of game play every week. So  that's probably a bit of a counter intuitive idea  so I'll say it again  let it sink in  If we want to solve problems like hunger  poverty  climate change  global conflict  obesity  I believe that we need to aspire to play games online for at least    billion hours a week  by the end of the next decade. No. I'm serious. I am. Here's why. This picture pretty much sums up why I think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species. Truly. This is a portrait by photographer Phil Toledano. He wanted to capture the emotion of gaming  so he set up a camera in front of gamers while they were playing. And this is a classic gaming emotion. Now  if you're not a gamer  you might miss some of the nuance in this photo. You probably see the sense of urgency  a little bit of fear  but intense concentration  deep  deep focus on tackling a really difficult problem. If you are a gamer  you will notice a few nuances here  the crinkle of the eyes up  and around the mouth is a sign of optimism  and the eyebrows up is surprise. This is a gamer who's on the verge of something called an  epic win.  Oh  you've heard of that. OK  good  so we have some gamers among us. An epic win is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive  you had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it. It was almost beyond the threshold of imagination  and when you get there  you're shocked to discover what you're truly capable of. That's an epic win. This is a gamer on the verge of an epic win. And this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem solvers all over the world as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century    the face of someone who  against all odds  is on the verge of an epic win. Now  unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems. This is what I call the  I'm Not Good At Life  face. This is actually me making it. Can you see  Yes. Good. This is me making the  I'm Not Good At Life  face. This is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood in Berkeley  California  where I did my PhD on why we're better in games than we are in real life. And this is a problem that a lot of gamers have. We feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games. I don't mean just good as in successful  although that's part of it. We do achieve more in game worlds. But I also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters    inspired to collaborate and to cooperate. And when we're in game worlds  I believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves    the most likely to help at a moment's notice  the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes  to get up after failure and try again. And in real life  when we face failure  when we confront obstacles  we often don't feel that way. We feel overcome  we feel overwhelmed  we feel anxious  maybe depressed  frustrated or cynical. We never have those feelings when we're playing games  they just don't exist in games. So that's what I wanted to study when I was a graduate student. What about games makes it impossible to feel that we can't achieve everything  How can we take those feelings from games and apply them to real world work  So I looked at games like World of Warcraft  which is really the ideal collaborative problem solving environment. And I started to notice a few things that make epic wins so possible in online worlds. The first thing is whenever you show up in one of these online games  especially in World of Warcraft  there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a world saving mission  right away. But not just any mission  it's a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game. Right  So you can do it. They never give you a challenge you can't achieve. But it is on the verge of what you're capable of  so you have to try hard. But there's no unemployment in World of Warcraft  no sitting around  wringing your hands    there's always something specific and important to be done. There are also tons of collaborators. Everywhere you go  hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your epic mission. That's not something we have in real life that easily  this sense that at our fingertips are tons of collaborators. And there's this epic story  this inspiring story of why we're there  and what we're doing  and we get all this positive feedback. You guys have heard of leveling up     strength     intelligence. We don't get that kind of constant feedback in real life. When I get off this stage  I'm not going to have    speaking  and    crazy idea      crazy idea. I don't get that feedback in real life. Now  the problem with collaborative online environments like World of Warcraft is that it's so satisfying to be on the verge of an epic win all the time  we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds. It's just better than reality. So  so far  collectively all the World of Warcraft gamers have spent  .   million years solving the virtual problems of Azeroth. Now  that's not necessarily a bad thing. It might sound like it's a bad thing. But to put that in context   .   million years ago was when our earliest primate human ancestors stood up. That was the first upright primate. So when we talk about how much time we're currently investing in playing games  the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution  which is an extraordinary thing. But it's also apt  because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games  we're actually changing what we are capable of as human beings. We're evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species. This is true. I believe this. So  consider this really interesting statistic  it was recently published by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University  The average young person today in a country with a strong gamer culture will have spent        hours playing online games by the age of   . Now        hours is a really interesting number for two reasons. First of all  for children in the United States         hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school  from fifth grade to high school graduation  if you have perfect attendance. So  we have an entire parallel track of education going on  where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gamer as they're learning about everything else in school. Some of you have probably read Malcolm Gladwell's new book  Outliers   so you would have heard of his theory of success  the         hours  theory of success. It's based on this great cognitive science research that says if we can master        hours of effortful study at anything by the age of     we will be virtuosos at it. We will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world. And so  now what we're looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtuoso gamers. So  the big question is   What exactly are gamers getting so good at   Because if we could figure that out  we would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands. This is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games. These are our virtuoso gamers      million people who are extraordinarily good at something. And in the next decade  we're going to have another billion gamers who are extraordinarily good at whatever that is. If you don't know it already  this is coming. The game industry is developing consoles that are low energy and that work with the wireless phone networks instead of broadband Internet  so that gamers all over the world  particularly in India  China  Brazil  can get online. They expect one billion more gamers in the next decade. It will bring us up to  .  billion gamers. So I've started to think about what these games are making us virtuosos at. Here are the four things I came up with. The first is urgent optimism. OK  think of this as extreme self motivation. Urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately to tackle an obstacle  combined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success. Gamers always believe that an epic win is possible  and that it's always worth trying  and trying now. Gamers don't sit around. Gamers are virtuosos at weaving a tight social fabric. There's a lot of interesting research that shows we like people better after we play a game with them  even if they've beaten us badly. And the reason is  it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone. We trust that they will spend their time with us  that they will play by the same rules  value the same goal  stay with the game until it's over. And so  playing a game together actually builds up bonds and trust and cooperation. And we actually build stronger social relationships as a result. Blissful productivity. I love it. You know  there's a reason why the average World of Warcraft gamer plays for    hours a week    kind of a half time job. It's because we know  when we're playing a game  that we're actually happier working hard than we are relaxing  or hanging out. We know that we are optimized as human beings  to do hard and meaningful work. And gamers are willing to work hard all the time  if they're given the right work. Finally  epic meaning. Gamers love to be attached to awe inspiring missions to human planetary scale stories. So  just one bit of trivia that helps put that into perspective  So  you all know Wikipedia  biggest wiki in the world. Second biggest wiki in the world  with nearly        articles  is the World of Warcraft wiki. Five million people use it every month. They have compiled more information about World of Warcraft on the Internet than any other topic covered on any other wiki in the world. They are building an epic story. They are building an epic knowledge resource about the World of Warcraft. Okay  so these are four superpowers that add up to one thing  Gamers are super empowered hopeful individuals. These are people who believe that they are individually capable of changing the world. And the only problem is  they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world. That's the problem that I'm trying to solve. There's an economist named Edward Castronova. His work is brilliant. He looks at why people are investing so much time and energy and money in online worlds. And he says   We're witnessing what amounts to no less than a mass exodus to virtual worlds and online game environments.  And he's an economist  so he's rational. And he says    Not like me  I'm a game designer  I'm exuberant. But he says that this makes perfect sense  because gamers can achieve more in online worlds than they can in real life. They can have stronger social relationships in games than they can have in real life  they get better feedback and feel more rewarded in games than they do in real life. So he says  for now it makes perfect sense for gamers to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world. Now  I also agree that that is rational  for now. But it is not  by any means  an optimal situation. We have to start making the real world work more like a game. I take my inspiration from something that happened       years ago. These are ancient dice  made out of sheep's knuckles. Before we had awesome game controllers  we had sheep's knuckles. And these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings  and if you're familiar with the work of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus  you might know this history  which is the history of who invented games and why. Herodotus says that games  particularly dice games  were invented in the kingdom of Lydia  during a time of famine. Apparently  there was such a severe famine that the king of Lydia decided they had to do something crazy. People were suffering. People were fighting. It was an extreme situation  they needed an extreme solution. So  according to Herodotus  they invented dice games  and they set up a kingdom wide policy  On one day  everybody would eat  and on the next day  everybody would play games. And they would be so immersed in playing the dice games  because games are so engaging  and immerse us in such satisfying  blissful productivity  they would ignore the fact that they had no food to eat. And then on the next day  they would play games  and on the next day  they would eat. And according to Herodotus  they passed    years this way  surviving through a famine  by eating on one day  and playing games on the next. Now  this is exactly  I think  how we're using games today. We're using games to escape real world suffering    we're using games to get away from everything that's broken in the real environment  everything that's not satisfying about real life  and we're getting what we need from games. But it doesn't have to end there. This is really exciting. According to Herodotus  after    years the famine wasn't getting better  so the king decided they would play one final dice game. They divided the entire kingdom in half. They played one dice game  and the winners of that game got to go on an epic adventure. They would leave Lydia  and they would go out in search of a new place to live  leaving behind just enough people to survive on the resources that were available  and hopefully to take their civilization somewhere else where they could thrive. Now  this sounds crazy  right  But recently  DNA evidence has shown that the Etruscans  who then led to the Roman Empire  actually share the same DNA as the ancient Lydians. And so  recently  scientists have suggested that Herodotus' crazy story is actually true. And geologists have found evidence of a global cooling that lasted for nearly    years  that could have explained the famine. So this crazy story might be true. They might have actually saved their culture by playing games  escaping to games for    years  and then been so inspired  and knew so much about how to come together with games  that they actually saved the entire civilization that way. Okay  we can do that. We've been playing Warcraft since     . That was the first real time strategy game from the World of Warcraft series. That was    years ago. They played dice games for    years  we've been playing Warcraft for    years. I say we are ready for our own epic game. Now  they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world  so that's where I get my    billion hours a week of game play from. Let's get half of us to agree to spend an hour a day playing games  until we solve real world problems. Now  I know you're asking   How are we going to solve real world problems in games   Well  that's what I've devoted my work to over the past few years  at the Institute for the Future. We have this banner in our offices in Palo Alto  and it expresses our view of how we should try to relate to the future. We do not want to try to predict the future. What we want to do is make the future. We want to imagine the best case scenario outcome  and then we want to empower people to make that outcome a reality. We want to imagine epic wins  and then give people the means to achieve the epic win. I'm just going to very briefly show you three games that I've made that are an attempt to give people the means to create epic wins in their own futures. This is World Without Oil. We made this game in     . This is an online game in which you try to survive an oil shortage. The oil shortage is fictional  but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it's real  and to live your real life as if we've run out of oil. So when you come to the game  you sign up  tell us where you live  and then we give you real time news videos  data feeds that show you exactly how much oil costs  what's not available  how food supply is being affected  how transportation is being affected  if schools are closed  if there's rioting  and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true. And then we ask you to blog about it  to post videos  to post photos. We piloted this game with       players in       and we've tracked them for the three years since. And I can tell you that this is a transformative experience. Nobody wants to change how they live  just because it's good for the world  or because we're supposed to. But if you immerse them in an epic adventure and tell them   We've run out of oil. This is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on. Challenge yourself to see how you would survive   most of our players have kept up the habits that they learned in this game. So for the next world saving game  we decided to aim higher    bigger problem than just peak oil. We did a game called Superstruct at the Institute for the Future. And the premise was  a supercomputer has calculated that humans have only    years left on the planet. This supercomputer was called the Global Extinction Awareness System  of course. We asked people to come online    almost like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie. You know Jerry Bruckheimer movies  you form a dream team    you've got the astronaut  the scientist  the ex convict  and they all have something to do to save the world. But in our game  instead of just having five people on the dream team  we said   Everybody's on the dream team  and it's your job to invent the future of energy  the future of food  the future of health  the future of security and the future of the social safety net.  We had       people play that game for eight weeks. They came up with     insanely creative solutions that you can go online  Google  Superstruct   and see. So  finally  the last game  we're launching it March  rd. This is a game done with the World Bank Institute. If you complete the game  you will be certified by the World Bank Institute as a Social Innovator  class of     . Working with universities all over sub Saharan Africa  and we are inviting them to learn social innovation skills. We've got a graphic novel  we've got leveling up in skills like local insight  knowledge networking  sustainability  vision and resourcefulness. I would like to invite all of you to please share this game with young people  anywhere in the world  particularly in developing areas  who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enterprises to save the world. So  I'm going to wrap up now. I want to ask a question. What do you think happens next  We've got all these amazing gamers  we've got these games that are kind of pilots of what we might do  but none of them have saved the real world yet. Well I hope you will agree with me that gamers are a human resource that we can use to do real world work  that games are a powerful platform for change. We have all these amazing superpowers  blissful productivity  the ability to weave a tight social fabric  this feeling of urgent optimism and the desire for epic meaning. I really hope that we can come together to play games that matter  to survive on this planet for another century. That's my hope  that you will join me in making and playing games like this. When I look forward to the next decade  I know two things for sure  that we can make any future we can imagine  and we can play any games we want  so I say  Let the world changing games begin. Thank you. OK. We've heard a lot of people speak at this conference about the power of the human mind. And what I'd like to do today is give you a vivid example of how that power can be unleashed when someone is in a survival situation  how the will to survive can bring that out in people. This is an incident which occurred on Mount Everest  it was the worst disaster in the history of Everest. And when it occurred  I was the only doctor on the mountain. So I'll take you through that and we'll see what it's like when someone really summons the will to survive. OK  this is Mount Everest. It's        feet high. I've been there six times  Four times I did work with National Geographic  making tectonic plate measurements  twice  I went with NASA doing remote sensing devices. It was on my fourth trip to Everest that a comet passed over the mountain. Hyakutake. And the Sherpas told us then that was a very bad omen  and we should have listened to them. Everest is an extreme environment. There's only one third as much oxygen at the summit as there is at sea level. Near the summit  temperatures can be    degrees below zero. You can have winds    to    miles an hour. It's actually a wind chill factor which is lower than a summer day on Mars. I remember one time being up near the summit  I reached into my down jacket for a drink from my water bottle  inside my down jacket  only to discover that the water was already frozen solid. That gives you an idea of just how severe things are near the summit. OK  this is the route up Everest. It starts at base camp  at        feet. Camp One        feet higher. Camp Two  another       feet higher up  what's called the Western Cwm. CampThree is at the base of Lhotse  which is the fourth highest mountain in the world  but it's dwarfed by Everest. And then Camp Four is the highest camp  that's       feet short of the summit. This is a view of base camp. This is pitched on a glacier at        feet. It's the highest point you can bring your yaks before you have to unload. And this is what they unloaded for me  I had four yak loads of medical supplies  which are dumped in a tent  and here I am trying to arrange things. This was our expedition. It was a National Geographic expedition  but it was organized by The Explorers Club. There were three other expeditions on the mountain  an American team  a New Zealand team and an IMAX team. And  after actually two months of preparation  we built our camps all the way up the mountain. This is a view looking up the icefall  the first       feet of the climb up from base camp. And here's a picture in the icefall  it's a waterfall  but it's frozen  but it moves very slowly  and it actually changes every day. When you're in it  you're like a rat in a maze  you can't even see over the top. This is near the top of the icefall. You want to climb through at night when the ice is frozen. That way  it's less likely to tumble down on you. These are some climbers reaching the top of the icefall just at sun up. This is me crossing a crevasse. We cross on aluminum ladders with safety ropes attached. That's another crevasse. Some of these things are    stories deep or more  and one of my climbing friends says that the reason we actually climb at night is because if we ever saw the bottom of what we're climbing over  we would never do it. Okay. This is Camp One. It's the first flat spot you can reach after you get up to the top of the icefall. And from there we climb up to Camp Two  which is sort of the foreground. These are climbers moving up the Lhotse face  that mountain toward Camp Three. They're on fixed ropes here. A fall here  if you weren't roped in  would be       feet down. This is a view taken from camp three. You can see the Lhotse face is in profile  it's about a    degree angle. It takes two days to climb it  so you put the camp halfway through. If you notice  the summit of Everest is black. There's no ice over it. And that's because Everest is so high  it's in the jet stream  and winds are constantly scouring the face  so no snow gets to accumulate. What looks like a cloud behind the summit ridge is actually snow being blown off the summit. This is on the way up from Camp Three to Camp Four  moving in  up through the clouds. And this is at Camp Four. Once you get to Camp Four  you have maybe    hours to decide if you're going to go for the summit or not. Everybody's on oxygen  your supplies are limited  and you either have to go up or go down  make that decision very quickly. This is a picture of Rob Hall. He was the leader of the New Zealand team. This is a radio he used later to call his wife that I'll tell you about. These are some climbers waiting to go to the summit. They're up at Camp Four  and you can see that there's wind blowing off the summit. This is not good weather to climb in  so the climbers are just waiting  hoping that the wind's going to die down. And  in fact  the wind does die down at night. It becomes very calm  there's no wind at all. This looks like a good chance to go for the summit. So here are some climbers starting out for the summit on what's called the Triangular Face. It's the first part of climb. It's done in the dark  because it's actually less steep than what comes next  and you can gain daylight hours if you do this in the dark. So that's what happened. The climbers got on the southeast ridge. This is the view looking at the southeast ridge. The summit would be in the foreground. From here  it's about       feet up at a    degree angle to the summit. But what happened that year was the wind suddenly and unexpectedly picked up. A storm blew in that no one was anticipating. You can see here some ferocious winds blowing snow way high off the summit. And there were climbers on that summit ridge. This is a picture of me in that area taken a year before  and you can see I've got an oxygen mask on with a rebreather. I have an oxygen hose connected here. You can see on this climber  we have two oxygen tanks in the backpack    little titanium tanks  very lightweight    and we're not carrying much else. This is all you've got. You're very exposed on the summit ridge. OK  this is a view taken on the summit ridge itself. This is on the way toward the summit  on that       foot bridge. All the climbers here are climbing unroped  and the reason is because the drop off is so sheer on either side that if you were roped to somebody  you'd wind up just pulling them off with you. So each person climbs individually. And it's not a straight path at all  it's very difficult climbing  and there's always the risk of falling on either side. If you fall to your left  you're going to fall       feet into Nepal  if you fall to your right  you're going to fall        feet into Tibet. So it's probably better to fall into Tibet because you'll live longer. But  either way  you fall for the rest of your life. OK. Those climbers were up near the summit  along that summit ridge that you see up there  and I was down here in Camp Three. My expedition was down in Camp Three  while these guys were up there in the storm. The storm was so fierce that we had to lay  fully dressed  fully equipped  laid out on the tent floor to stop the tent from blowing off the mountain. It was the worst winds I've ever seen. And the climbers up on the ridge were that much higher        feet higher  and completely exposed to the elements. We were in radio contact with some of them. This is a view taken along the summit ridge. Rob Hall  we heard by radio  was up here  at this point in the storm with Doug Hansen. And we heard that Rob was OK  but Doug was too weak to come down. He was exhausted  and Rob was staying with him. We also got some bad news in the storm that Beck Weathers  another climber  had collapsed in the snow and was dead. There were still    other climbers that we weren't aware of their condition. They were lost. There was total confusion on the mountain  all the stories were confusing  most of them were conflicting. We really had no idea what was going on during that storm. We were just hunkered down in our tents at Camp Three. Our two strongest climbers  Todd Burleson and Pete Athans  decided to go up to try to rescue who they could even though there was a ferocious storm going. They tried to radio a message to Rob Hall  who was a superb climber stuck  sort of  with a weak climber up near the summit. I expected them to say to Rob   Hold on. We're coming.  But in fact  what they said was   Leave Doug and come down yourself. There's no chance of saving him  and just try to save yourself at this point.  And Rob got that message  but his answer was   We're both listening.  Todd and Pete got up to the summit ridge  up in here  and it was a scene of complete chaos up there. But they did what they could to stabilize the people. I gave them radio advice from Camp Three  and we sent down the climbers that could make it down under their own power. The ones that couldn't we just sort of decided to leave up at Camp Four. So the climbers were coming down along this route. This is taken from Camp Three  where I was. And they all came by me so I could take a look at them and see what I could do for them  which is really not much  because Camp Three is a little notch cut in the ice in the middle of a    degree angle. You can barely stand outside the tent. It's really cold  it's        feet. The only supplies I had at that altitude were two plastic bags with preloaded syringes of painkiller and steroids. So  as the climbers came by me  I sort of assessed whether or not they were in condition to continue on further down. The ones that weren't that lucid or were not that well coordinated  I would give an injection of steroids to try to give them some period of lucidity and coordination where they could then work their way further down the mountain. It's so awkward to work up there that sometimes I even gave the injections right through their clothes. It was just too hard to maneuver any other way up there. While I was taking care of them  we got more news about Rob Hall. There was no way we could get up high enough to rescue him. He called in to say that he was alone now. Apparently  Doug had died higher up on the mountain. But Rob was now too weak to come down himself  and with the fierce winds and up at that altitude  he was just beyond rescue and he knew it. At that point  he asked to be paged into his wife. He was carrying a radio. His wife was home in New Zealand  seven months pregnant with their first child  and Rob asked to be patched into her. That was done  and Rob and his wife had their last conversation. They picked the name for their baby. Rob then signed off  and that was the last we ever heard of him. I was faced with treating a lot of critically ill patients at        feet  which was an impossibility. So what we did was  we got the victims down to        feet  where it was easier for me to treat them. This was my medical kit. It's a tackle box filled with medical supplies. This is what I carried up the mountain. I had more supplies lower down  which I asked to be brought up to meet me at the lower camp. And this was scene at the lower camp. The survivors came in one by one. Some of them were hypothermic  some of them were frostbitten  some were both. What we did was try to warm them up as best we could  put oxygen on them and try to revive them  which is difficult to do at        feet  when the tent is freezing. This is some severe frostbite on the feet  severe frostbite on the nose. This climber was snow blind. As I was taking care of these climbers  we got a startling experience. Out of nowhere  Beck Weathers  who we had already been told was dead  stumbled into the tent  just like a mummy  he walked into the tent. I expected him to be incoherent  but  in fact  he walked into the tent and said to me   Hi  Ken. Where should I sit   And then he said   Do you accept my health insurance   He really said that. So he was completely lucid  but he was very severely frostbitten. You can see his hand is completely white  his face  his nose  is burned. First  it turns white  and then when it's completed necrosis  it turns black  and then it falls off. It's the last stage  just like a scar. So  as I was taking care of Beck  he related what had been going on up there. He said he had gotten lost in the storm  collapsed in the snow  and just laid there  unable to move. Some climbers had come by and looked at him  and he heard them say   He's dead.  But Beck wasn't dead  he heard that  but he was completely unable to move. He was in some sort of catatonic state where he could be aware of his surroundings  but couldn't even blink to indicate that he was alive. So the climbers passed him by  and Beck lay there for a day  a night and another day  in the snow. And then he said to himself   I don't want to die. I have a family to come back to.  And the thoughts of his family  his kids and his wife  generated enough energy  enough motivation in him  so that he actually got up. After laying in the snow that long a time  he got up and found his way back to the camp. And Beck told me that story very quietly  but I was absolutely stunned by it. I couldn't imagine anybody laying in the snow that long a time and then getting up. He apparently reversed an irreversible hypothermia. And I can only try to speculate on how he did it. So  what if we had Beck hooked up to a SPECT scan  something that could actually measure brain function  Just very simply  the three parts of the brain  the frontal lobe  where you focus your attention and concentration  you have the temporal lobe  where you form images and keep memories  and the posterior part of your brain  which contains the cerebellum  which controls motion  and the brain stem  where you have your basic maintenance functions  like heartbeat and respiration. So let's take a cut through the brain here  and imagine that Beck was hooked up to a SPECT scan. This measures dynamic blood flow and therefore energy flow within the brain. So you have the prefrontal cortex here  lighting up in red. This is a pretty evenly distributed scan. You have the middle area  where the temporal lobe might be  in here  and the posterior portion  where the maintenance functions are in the back. This is a roughly normal scan  showing equal distribution of energy. Now  you go to this one and you see how much more the frontal lobes are lighting up. This might be what Beck would be experiencing when he realizes he's in danger. He's focusing all his attention on getting himself out of trouble. These parts of the brain are quieting down. He's not thinking about his family or anybody else at this point  and he's working pretty hard. He's trying to get his muscles going and get out of this. OK  but he's losing ground here. He's running out of energy. It's too cold  he can't keep his metabolic fires going  and  you see  there's no more red here  his brain is quieting down. He's collapsed in the snow here. Everything is quiet  there's very little red anywhere. Beck is powering down. He's dying. You go on to the next scan  but  in Beck's case  you can see that the middle part of his brain is beginning to light up again. He's beginning to think about his family. He's beginning to have images that are motivating him to get up. He's developing energy in this area through thought. And this is how he's going to turn thought back into action. This part of the brain is called the anterior cingulate gyrus. It's an area in which a lot of neuroscientists believe the seat of will exists. This is where people make decisions  where they develop willpower. And  you can see  there's an energy flow going from the mid portion of his brain  where he's got images of his family  into this area  which is powering his will. Okay. This is getting stronger and stronger to the point where it's actually going to be a motivating factor. He's going to develop enough energy in that area    after a day  a night and a day    to actually motivate himself to get up. And you can see here  he's starting to get more energy into the frontal lobe. He's beginning to focus  he can concentrate now. He's thinking about what he's got to do to save himself. So this energy has been transmitted up toward the front of his brain  and it's getting quieter down here  but he's using this energy to think about what he has to do to get himself going. And then  that energy is sort of spreading throughout his thought areas. He's not thinking about his family now  and he's getting himself motivated. This is the posterior part  where his muscles are going to be moving  and he's going to be pacing himself. His heart and lungs are going to pick up speed. So this is what I can speculate might have been going on had we been able to do a SPECT scan on Beck during this survival epic. So here I am taking care of Beck at        feet  and I felt what I was doing was completely trivial compared to what he had done for himself. It just shows you what the power of the mind can do. He was critically ill  there were other critically ill patients  luckily  we were able to get a helicopter in to rescue these guys. A helicopter came in at        feet and carried out the highest helicopter rescue in history. It was able to land on the ice  take away Beck and the other survivors  one by one  and get them off to Kathmandu in a clinic before we even got back to base camp. This is a scene at base camp  at one of the camps where some of the climbers were lost. And we had a memorial service there a few days later. These are Serphas lighting juniper branches. They believe juniper smoke is holy. And the climbers stood around on the high rocks and spoke of the climbers who were lost up near the summit  turning to the mountain  actually  to talk to them directly. There were five climbers lost here. This was Scott Fischer  Rob Hall  Andy Harris  Doug Hansen and Yasuko Namba. And one more climber should have died that day  but didn't  and that's Beck Weathers. He was able to survive because he was able to generate that incredible willpower  he was able to use all the power of his mind to save himself. These are Tibetan prayer flags. These Sherpas believe that if you write prayers on these flags  the message will be carried up to the gods  and that year  Beck's message was answered. Thank you. So  I was just asked to go and shoot this film called  Elizabeth.  And we're all talking about this great English icon and saying   She's a fantastic woman  she does everything. How are we going to introduce her   So we went around the table with the studio and the producers and the writer  and they came to me and said   Shekhar  what do you think   And I said   I think she's dancing.  And I could see everybody looked at me  somebody said   Bollywood.  The other said   How much did we hire him for   And the third said   Let's find another director.  I thought I had better change. So we had a lot of discussion on how to introduce Elizabeth  and I said   OK  maybe I am too Bollywood. Maybe Elizabeth  this great icon  dancing  What are you talking about   So I rethought the whole thing  and then we all came to a consensus. And here was the introduction of this great British icon called  Elizabeth.  Leicester  May I join you  my lady  Elizabeth  If it please you  sir. Shekhar Kapur  So she was dancing. So how many people who saw the film did not get that here was a woman in love  that she was completely innocent and saw great joy in her life  and she was youthful  And how many of you did not get that  That's the power of visual storytelling  that's the power of dance  that's the power of music  the power of not knowing. When I go out to direct a film  every day we prepare too much  we think too much. Knowledge becomes a weight upon wisdom. You know  simple words lost in the quicksand of experience. So I come up  and I say   What am I going to do today   I'm not going to do what I planned to do  and I put myself into absolute panic. It's my one way of getting rid of my mind  getting rid of this mind that says   Hey  you know what you're doing. You know exactly what you're doing. You're a director  you've done it for years.  So I've got to get there and be in complete panic. It's a symbolic gesture. I tear up the script  I go and I panic myself  I get scared. I'm doing it right now  you can watch me. I'm getting nervous  I don't know what to say  I don't know what I'm doing  I don't want to go there. And as I go there  of course  my A.D. says   You know what you're going to do  sir.  I say   Of course I do.  And the studio executives  they would say   Hey  look at Shekhar. He's so prepared.  And inside I've just been listening to Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan because he's chaotic. I'm allowing myself to go into chaos because out of chaos  I'm hoping some moments of truth will come. All preparation is preparation. I don't even know if it's honest. I don't even know if it's truthful. The truth of it all comes on the moment  organically  and if you get five great moments of great  organic stuff in your storytelling  in your film  your film  audiences will get it. So I'm looking for those moments  and I'm standing there and saying   I don't know what to say.  So  ultimately  everybody's looking at you      people at seven in the morning who got there at quarter to seven  and you arrived at seven  and everybody's saying   Hey. What's the first thing  What's going to happen   And you put yourself into a state of panic where you don't know  and so you don't know. And so  because you don't know  you're praying to the universe because you're praying to the universe that something    I'm going to try and access the universe the way Einstein    say a prayer    accessed his equations  the same source. I'm looking for the same source because creativity comes from absolutely the same source that you meditate somewhere outside yourself  outside the universe. You're looking for something that comes and hits you. Until that hits you  you're not going to do the first shot. So what do you do  So Cate says   Shekhar  what do you want me to do   And I say   Cate  what do you want to do    Laughter   You're a great actor  and I like to give to my actors    why don't you show me what you want to do   What am I doing  I'm trying to buy time. I'm trying to buy time. So the first thing about storytelling that I learned  and I follow all the time is  Panic. Panic is the great access of creativity because that's the only way to get rid of your mind. Get rid of your mind. Get out of it  get it out. And let's go to the universe because there's something out there that is more truthful than your mind  that is more truthful than your universe.  unclear   you said that yesterday. I'm just repeating it because that's what I follow constantly to find the shunyata somewhere  the emptiness. Out of the emptiness comes a moment of creativity. So that's what I do. When I was a kid    I was about eight years old. You remember how India was. There was no pollution. In Delhi  we used to live    we used to call it a chhat or the khota. Khota's now become a bad word. It means their terrace    and we used to sleep out at night. At school I was being just taught about physics  and I was told that if there is something that exists  then it is measurable. If it is not measurable  it does not exist. And at night I would lie out  looking at the unpolluted sky  as Delhi used to be at that time when I was a kid  and I used to stare at the universe and say   How far does this universe go   My father was a doctor. And I would think   Daddy  how far does the universe go   And he said   Son  it goes on forever.  So I said   Please measure forever because in school they're teaching me that if I cannot measure it  it does not exist. It doesn't come into my frame of reference.  So  how far does eternity go  What does forever mean  And I would lie there crying at night because my imagination could not touch creativity. So what did I do  At that time  at the tender age of seven  I created a story. What was my story  And I don't know why  but I remember the story. There was a woodcutter who's about to take his ax and chop a piece of wood  and the whole galaxy is one atom of that ax. And when that ax hits that piece of wood  that's when everything will destroy and the Big Bang will happen again. But all before that there was a woodcutter. And then when I would run out of that story  I would imagine that woodcutter's universe is one atom in the ax of another woodcutter. So every time  I could tell my story again and again and get over this problem  and so I got over the problem. How did I do it  Tell a story. So what is a story  A story is our    all of us    we are the stories we tell ourselves. In this universe  and this existence  where we live with this duality of whether we exist or not and who are we  the stories we tell ourselves are the stories that define the potentialities of our existence. We are the stories we tell ourselves. So that's as wide as we look at stories. A story is the relationship that you develop between who you are  or who you potentially are  and the infinite world  and that's our mythology. We tell our stories  and a person without a story does not exist. So Einstein told a story and followed his stories and came up with theories and came up with theories and then came up with his equations. Alexander had a story that his mother used to tell him  and he went out to conquer the world. We all  everybody  has a story that they follow. We tell ourselves stories. So  I will go further  and I say   I tell a story  and therefore I exist.  I exist because there are stories  and if there are no stories  we don't exist. We create stories to define our existence. If we do not create the stories  we probably go mad. I don't know  I'm not sure  but that's what I've done all the time. Now  a film. A film tells a story. I often wonder when I make a film    I'm thinking of making a film of the Buddha    and I often wonder  If Buddha had all the elements that are given to a director    if he had music  if he had visuals  if he had a video camera    would we get Buddhism better  But that puts some kind of burden on me. I have to tell a story in a much more elaborate way  but I have the potential. It's called subtext. When I first went to Hollywood  they said    I used to talk about subtext  and my agent came to me   Would you kindly not talk about subtext   And I said   Why   He said   Because nobody is going to give you a film if you talk about subtext. Just talk about plot and say how wonderful you'll shoot the film  what the visuals will be.  So when I look at a film  here's what we look for  We look for a story on the plot level  then we look for a story on the psychological level  then we look for a story on the political level  then we look at a story on a mythological level. And I look for stories on each level. Now  it is not necessary that these stories agree with each other. What is wonderful is  at many times  the stories will contradict with each other. So when I work with Rahman who's a great musician  I often tell him   Don't follow what the script already says. Find that which is not. Find the truth for yourself  and when you find the truth for yourself  there will be a truth in it  but it may contradict the plot  but don't worry about it.  So  the sequel to  Elizabeth    Golden Age.  When I made the sequel to  Elizabeth   here was a story that the writer was telling  A woman who was threatened by Philip II and was going to war  and was going to war  fell in love with Walter Raleigh. Because she fell in love with Walter Raleigh  she was giving up the reasons she was a queen  and then Walter Raleigh fell in love with her lady in waiting  and she had to decide whether she was a queen going to war or she wanted... Here's the story I was telling  The gods up there  there were two people. There was Philip II  who was divine because he was always praying  and there was Elizabeth  who was divine  but not quite divine because she thought she was divine  but the blood of being mortal flowed in her. But the divine one was unjust  so the gods said   OK  what we need to do is help the just one.  And so they helped the just one. And what they did was  they sent Walter Raleigh down to physically separate her mortal self from her spirit self. And the mortal self was the girl that Walter Raleigh was sent  and gradually he separated her so she was free to be divine. And the two divine people fought  and the gods were on the side of divinity. Of course  all the British press got really upset. They said   We won the Armada.  But I said   But the storm won the Armada. The gods sent the storm.  So what was I doing  I was trying to find a mythic reason to make the film. Of course  when I asked Cate Blanchett  I said   What's the film about   She said   The film's about a woman coming to terms with growing older.  Psychological. The writer said  It's about history  plot.  I said  It's about mythology  the gods.  So let me show you a film    a piece from that film    and how a camera also    so this is a scene  where in my mind  she was at the depths of mortality. She was discovering what mortality actually means  and if she is at the depths of mortality  what really happens. And she's recognizing the dangers of mortality and why she should break away from mortality. Remember  in the film  to me  both her and her lady in waiting were parts of the same body  one the mortal self and one the spirit self. So can we have that second  Elizabeth  Bess  Bess  Bess Throckmorton  Bess  Here  my lady. Elizabeth  Tell me  is it true  Are you with child  Are you with child  Bess  Yes  my lady. Elizabeth  Traitorous. You dare to keep secrets from me  You ask my permission before you rut  before you breed. My bitches wear my collars. Do you hear me  Do you hear me  Walsingham  Majesty. Please  dignity. Mercy. Elizabeth  This is no time for mercy  Walsingham. You go to your traitor brother and leave me to my business. Is it his  Tell me. Say it. Is the child his  Is it his  Bess  Yes. My lady  it is my husband's child. Elizabeth  Bitch   Cries  Raleigh  Majesty. This is not the queen I love and serve. Elizabeth  This man has seduced a ward of the queen  and she has married without royal consent. These offenses are punishable by law. Arrest him. Go. You no longer have the queen's protection. Bess  As you wish  Majesty. Elizabeth  Get out  Get out  Get out  Get out. Shekhar Kapur  So  what am I trying to do here  Elizabeth has realized  and she's coming face to face with her own sense of jealousy  her own sense of mortality. What am I doing with the architecture  The architecture is telling a story. The architecture is telling a story about how  even though she's the most powerful woman in the world at that time  there is the other  the architecture's bigger. The stone is bigger than her because stone is an organic. It'll survive her. So it's telling you  to me  stone is part of her destiny. Not only that  why is the camera looking down  The camera's looking down at her because she's in the well. She's in the absolute well of her own sense of being mortal. That's where she has to pull herself out from the depths of mortality  come in  release her spirit. And that's the moment where  in my mind  both Elizabeth and Bess are the same person. But that's the moment she's surgically removing herself from that. So the film is operating on many many levels in that scene. And how we tell stories visually  with music  with actors  and at each level it's a different sense and sometimes contradictory to each other. So how do I start all this  What's the process of telling a story  About ten years ago  I heard this little thing from a politician  not a politician that was very well respected in India. And he said that these people in the cities  in one flush  expend as much water as you people in the rural areas don't get for your family for two days. That struck a chord  and I said   That's true.  I went to see a friend of mine  and he made me wait in his apartment in Malabar Hill on the twentieth floor  which is a really  really upmarket area in Mumbai. And he was having a shower for    minutes. I got bored and left  and as I drove out  I drove past the slums of Bombay  as you always do  and I saw lines and lines in the hot midday sun of women and children with buckets waiting for a tanker to come and give them water. And an idea started to develop. So how does that become a story  I suddenly realized that we are heading towards disaster. So my next film is called  Paani  which means water. And now  out of the mythology of that  I'm starting to create a world. What kind of world do I create  and where does the idea  the design of that come  So  in my mind  in the future  they started to build flyovers. You understand flyovers  Yeah  They started to build flyovers to get from A to B faster  but they effectively went from one area of relative wealth to another area of relative wealth. And then what they did was they created a city above the flyovers. And the rich people moved to the upper city and left the poorer people in the lower cities  about    to    percent of the people have moved to the upper city. Now  where does this upper city and lower city come  There's a mythology in India about    where they say  and I'll say it in Hindi   Hindi  Right. What does that mean  It says that the rich are always sitting on the shoulders and survive on the shoulders of the poor. So  from that mythology  the upper city and lower city come. So the design has a story. And now  what happens is that the people of the upper city  they suck up all the water. Remember the word I said  suck up. They suck up all the water  keep to themselves  and they drip feed the lower city. And if there's any revolution  they cut off the water. And  because democracy still exists  there's a democratic way in which you say  Well  if you give us what  we want   we'll give you water.  So  okay my time is up. But I can go on about telling you how we evolve stories  and how stories effectively are who we are and how these get translated into the particular discipline that I am in  which is film. But ultimately  what is a story  It's a contradiction. Everything's a contradiction. The universe is a contradiction. And all of us are constantly looking for harmony. When you get up  the night and day is a contradiction. But you get up at   a.m. That first blush of blue is where the night and day are trying to find harmony with each other. Harmony is the notes that Mozart didn't give you  but somehow the contradiction of his notes suggest that. All contradictions of his notes suggest the harmony. It's the effect of looking for harmony in the contradiction that exists in a poet's mind  a contradiction that exists in a storyteller's mind. In a storyteller's mind  it's a contradiction of moralities. In a poet's mind  it's a conflict of words  in the universe's mind  between day and night. In the mind of a man and a woman  we're looking constantly at the contradiction between male and female  we're looking for harmony within each other. The whole idea of contradiction  but the acceptance of contradiction is the telling of a story  not the resolution. The problem with a lot of the storytelling in Hollywood and many films  and as  unclear  was saying in his  that we try to resolve the contradiction. Harmony is not resolution. Harmony is the suggestion of a thing that is much larger than resolution. Harmony is the suggestion of something that is embracing and universal and of eternity and of the moment. Resolution is something that is far more limited. It is finite  harmony is infinite. So that storytelling  like all other contradictions in the universe  is looking for harmony and infinity in moral resolutions  resolving one  but letting another go  letting another go and creating a question that is really important. Thank you very much. I'm going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values. Now  it's generally understood that questions of morality    questions of good and evil and right and wrong    are questions about which science officially has no opinion. It's thought that science can help us get what we value  but it can never tell us what we ought to value. And  consequently  most people    I think most people probably here    think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life  questions like   What is worth living for    What is worth dying for    What constitutes a good life   So  I'm going to argue that this is an illusion    that the separation between science and human values is an illusion    and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history. Now  it's often said that science cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values  because science deals with facts  and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres. It's often thought that there's no description of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be. But I think this is quite clearly untrue. Values are a certain kind of fact. They are facts about the well being of conscious creatures. Why is it that we don't have ethical obligations toward rocks  Why don't we feel compassion for rocks  It's because we don't think rocks can suffer. And if we're more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects  as indeed we are  it's because we think they're exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering. Now  the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim  This is something that we could be right or wrong about. And if we have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects. And there's no notion  no version of human morality and human values that I've ever come across that is not at some point reducible to a concern about conscious experience and its possible changes. Even if you get your values from religion  even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death    either to an eternity of happiness with God or an eternity of suffering in hell    you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes. And to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim  which  of course  may or may not be true. Now  to speak about the conditions of well being in this life  for human beings  we know that there is a continuum of such facts. We know that it's possible to live in a failed state  where everything that can go wrong does go wrong    where mothers cannot feed their children  where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration  where people are murdered indiscriminately. And we know that it's possible to move along this continuum towards something quite a bit more idyllic  to a place where a conference like this is even conceivable. And we know    we know    that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space. Would adding cholera to the water be a good idea  Probably not. Would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye  so that when bad things happened to them they immediately blame their neighbors  Probably not. There are truths to be known about how human communities flourish  whether or not we understand these truths. And morality relates to these truths. So  in talking about values we are talking about facts. Now  of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels    from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements. But if we're going to talk about human well being we are  of necessity  talking about the human brain. Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain    whatever happens after death. Even if the suicide bomber does get    virgins in the afterlife  in this life  his personality    his rather unfortunate personality    is the product of his brain. So the contributions of culture    if culture changes us  as indeed it does  it changes us by changing our brains. And so therefore whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings flourish can  at least in principle  be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind    neuroscience  psychology  etc. So  what I'm arguing is that value's reduced to facts    to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings. And we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beings. And I think of this as kind of a moral landscape  with peaks and valleys that correspond to differences in the well being of conscious creatures  both personal and collective. And one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well being that we rarely access  that few people access. And these await our discovery. Perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called mystical or spiritual. Perhaps there are other states that we can't access because of how our minds are structured but other minds possibly could access them. Now  let me be clear about what I'm not saying. I'm not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space  or that we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question. I don't think  for instance  that you will one day consult a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child  or whether we should bomb Iran's nuclear facilities  or whether you can deduct the full cost of TED as a business expense. But if questions affect human well being then they do have answers  whether or not we can find them. And just admitting this    just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish    will change the way we talk about morality  and will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future. For instance  there are    states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal  where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board  hard  and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin. And hundreds of thousands of children  incidentally  are subjected to this every year. The locations of these enlightened districts  I think  will fail to surprise you. We're not talking about Connecticut. And the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious. The creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod  lest we spoil the child    this is in Proverbs    and     and I believe    . But we can ask the obvious question  Is it a good idea  generally speaking  to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and good behavior  Is there any doubt that this question has an answer  and that it matters  Now  many of you might worry that the notion of well being is truly undefined  and seemingly perpetually open to be re construed. And so  how therefore can there be an objective notion of well being  Well  consider by analogy  the concept of physical health. The concept of physical health is undefined. As we just heard from Michael Specter  it has changed over the years. When this statue was carved the average life expectancy was probably   . It's now around    in the developed world. There may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that not being able to run a marathon at age     will be considered a profound disability. People will send you donations when you're in that condition. Notice that the fact that the concept of health is open  genuinely open for revision  does not make it vacuous. The distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science. Another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape  There may be equivalent ways to thrive  there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing. Now  why wouldn't this undermine an objective morality  Well think of how we talk about food  I would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat. There is clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food. But there's nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison. The fact that there are many right answers to the question   What is food   does not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition. Many people worry that a universal morality would require moral precepts that admit of no exceptions. So  for instance  if it's really wrong to lie  it must always be wrong to lie  and if you can find an exception  well then there's no such thing as moral truth. Why would we think this  Consider  by analogy  the game of chess. Now  if you're going to play good chess  a principle like   Don't lose your Queen   is very good to follow. But it clearly admits some exceptions. There are moments when losing your Queen is a brilliant thing to do. There are moments when it is the only good thing you can do. And yet  chess is a domain of perfect objectivity. The fact that there are exceptions here does not change that at all. Now  this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere. Consider the great problem of women's bodies  What to do about them  Well this is one thing you can do about them  You can cover them up. Now  it is the position  generally speaking  of our intellectual community that while we may not like this  we might think of this as  wrong  in Boston or Palo Alto  who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags  And who are we to say  even  that they're wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable  or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way  Well  who are we not to say this  Who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well being that we have to be non judgmental about a practice like this  I'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil    women should be able to wear whatever they want  as far as I'm concerned. But what does voluntary mean in a community where  when a girl gets raped  her father's first impulse  rather often  is to murder her out of shame  Just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute  Your daughter gets raped  and what you want to do is kill her. What are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing  Now  to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society. For instance  this is what it's like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized world. Now  granted  for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images. But if we are in a reflective mood  we can ask   Is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women's bodies   I mean  is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children  Probably not. OK  so perhaps there's some place on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of better balance. Perhaps there are many such places    again  given other changes in human culture there may be many peaks on the moral landscape. But the thing to notice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a peak. Now the irony  from my perspective  is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another. And of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind  not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well being. In fact  the endurance of religion as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering. This is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue. But the demagogues are right about one thing  We need a universal conception of human values. Now  what stands in the way of this  Well  one thing to notice is that we do something different when talking about morality    especially secular  academic  scientist types. When talking about morality we value differences of opinion in a way that we don't in any other area of our lives. So  for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion  and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness. On the other hand  we have someone like Ted Bundy  Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping and torturing and killing young women. So  we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one's time. Most Western intellectuals look at this situation and say   Well  there's nothing for the Dalai Lama to be really right about    really right about    or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about that admits of a real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science. He likes chocolate  he likes vanilla. There's nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other.  Notice that we don't do this in science. On the left you have Edward Witten. He's a string theorist. If you ask the smartest physicists around who is the smartest physicist around  in my experience half of them will say Ed Witten. The other half will tell you they don't like the question. So  what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference and said  String theory is bogus. It doesn't resonate with me. It's not how I chose to view the universe at a small scale. I'm not a fan.  Well  nothing would happen because I'm not a physicist  I don't understand string theory. I'm the Ted Bundy of string theory. I wouldn't want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member. But this is just the point. Whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded. That is what it is to have a domain of expertise. That is what it is for knowledge to count. How have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise  or moral talent  or moral genius even  How have we convinced ourselves that every opinion has to count  How have we convinced ourselves that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering  Does the Taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering  No. How is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well being  So  this  I think  is what the world needs now. It needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing  and morality relates to that domain of facts. It is possible for individuals  and even for whole cultures  to care about the wrong things  which is to say that it's possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead to needless human suffering. Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality. We live in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less  and they will one day mean nothing. We live in a world filled with destructive technology  and this technology cannot be uninvented  it will always be easier to break things than to fix them. It seems to me  therefore  patently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast differences in notions of human well being than we can respect or tolerate vast differences in the notions about how disease spreads  or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes. We simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life. And to do that  we have to admit that these questions have answers. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  So  some combustible material there. Whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world  hearing some of this  may well be doing the screaming with rage thing  after as well  some of them. Language seems to be really important here. When you're talking about the veil  you're talking about women dressed in cloth bags. I've lived in the Muslim world  spoken with a lot of Muslim women. And some of them would say something else. They would say   No  you know  this is a celebration of female specialness  it helps build that and it's a result of the fact that     and this is arguably a sophisticated psychological view     that male lust is not to be trusted.  I mean  can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without seeming kind of cultural imperialist  Sam Harris  Yeah  well I think I tried to broach this in a sentence  watching the clock ticking  but the question is  What is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations  and you're guaranteed to be treated in a certain way if you don't veil yourself  And so  if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil  or a very funny hat  or tattoo their face    I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want  but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under. And so I think we shouldn't be so eager to always take their word for it  especially when it's     degrees out and you're wearing a full burqa. CA  A lot of people want to believe in this concept of moral progress. But can you reconcile that  I think I understood you to say that you could reconcile that with a world that doesn't become one dimensional  where we all have to think the same. Paint your picture of what rolling the clock    years forward      years forward  how you would like to think of the world  balancing moral progress with richness. SH  Well  I think once you admit that we are on the path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some important detail  then you have to admit that we are going to understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail. So  we're going to understand positive social emotion like empathy and compassion  and we're going to understand the factors that encourage it    whether they're genetic  whether they're how people talk to one another  whether they're economic systems  and insofar as we begin to shine light on that we are inevitably going to converge on that fact space. So  everything is not going to be up for grabs. It's not going to be like veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as teaching her to be confident and well educated in the context of men who do desire women. I mean I don't think we need an NSF grant to know that compulsory veiling is a bad idea    but at a certain point we're going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved and actually interrogate them. Do people love their daughters just as much in these systems  And I think there are clearly right answers to that. CA  And if the results come out that actually they do  are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment on some of these issues  SH  Well yeah  modulo one obvious fact  that you can love someone in the context of a truly delusional belief system. So  you can say like   Because I knew my gay son was going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend  I chopped his head off. And that was the most compassionate thing I could do.  If you get all those parts aligned  yes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love. But again  then we have to talk about well being in a larger context. It's all of us in this together  not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus. CA  Sam  this is a conversation I would actually love to continue for hours. We don't have that  but maybe another time. Thank you for coming to TED. SH  Really an honor. Thank you. Illegal wildlife trade in Brazil is one of the major threats against our fauna  especially birds  and mainly to supply the pet market with thousands of animals taken from nature every month  and transported far from their origins  to be sold mainly in Rio de Janeiro and S o Paulo. It is estimated that all kinds of illegal wildlife trade in Brazil withdraw from nature almost    million animals every year  a business worth almost two billion dollars. The police intercepts these huge cargos with live animals  intended to supply the pet market  or they seize the animals directly from the people's houses  and this is how we end up  every month  with thousands of seized animals. And for us to understand what happens with them  we're going to follow Brad. In the eyes of many people  after the animals are seized  they say   Yay  justice has been served. The good guys arrived  took the cute  mistreated animals from the hands of the evil traffickers  and everyone lived happily ever after.  But did they  Actually  no  and this is where many of our problems begin. Because we have to figure out what to do with all these animals. In Brazil  they are usually first sent to governmental triage facilities  in which most of the cases  the conditions are as bad as with the traffickers. In       these centers received        animals  of which        were birds. And the police estimates that we seize only five percent of what's being trafficked. Some lucky ones    and among them  Brad    go to serious rehabilitation centers after that. And in these places they are cared for. They train their flying  they learn how to recognize the food they will find in nature  and they are able to socialize with others from the same species. But then what  The Brazil Ornithological Society    so now we're talking only birds    claims that we have too little knowledge about the species in nature. Therefore  it would be too risky to release these animals  both for the released and for the natural populations. They also claim that we spend too many resources in their rehabilitation. Following this argument  they suggest that all the birds seized from non threatened species should be euthanized. However  this would mean having killed        birds  only in the state of S o Paulo  only in     . But  some researchers  myself included    some NGOs and some people from the Brazilian government    believe there is an alternative. We think that if and when the animals meet certain criteria concerning their health  behavior  inferred origin and whatever we know about the natural populations  then technically responsible releases are possible  both for the well being of the individual  and for the conservation of the species and their ecosystems  because we will be returning genes for these populations    which could be important for them in facing environmental challenges    and also we could be returning potential seed dispersers  predators  preys  etc. All of these were released by us. On the top  the turtles are just enjoying freedom. On the middle  this guy nested a couple of weeks after the release. And on the bottom  my personal favorite  the little male over there  four hours after his release he was together with a wild female. So  this is not new  people have been doing this around the world. But it's still a big issue in Brazil. We believe we have performed responsible releases. We've registered released animals mating in nature and having chicks. So  these genes are indeed going back to the populations. However this is still a minority for the very lack of knowledge. So  I say   Let's study more  let's shed light on this issue  let's do whatever we can.  I'm devoting my career to that. And I'm here to urge each and every one of you to do whatever is in your reach  Talk to your neighbor  teach your children  make sure your pet is from a legal breeder. We need to act  and act now  before these ones are the only ones left. Thank you very much. So  basically we have public leaders  public officials who are out of control  they are writing bills that are unintelligible  and out of these bills are going to come maybe        pages of regulations  total complexity  which has a dramatically negative impact on our life. If you're a veteran coming back from Iraq or Vietnam you face a blizzard of paperwork to get your benefits  if you're trying to get a small business loan  you face a blizzard of paperwork. What are we going to do about it  I define simplicity as a means to achieving clarity  transparency and empathy  building humanity into communications. I've been simplifying things for    years. I come out of the advertising and design business. My focus is understanding you people  and how you interact with the government to get your benefits  how you interact with corporations to decide whom you're going to do business with  and how you view brands. So  very quickly  when President Obama said   I don't see why we can't have a one page  plain English consumer credit agreement.  So  I locked myself in a room  figured out the content  organized the document  and wrote it in plain English. I've had this checked by the two top consumer credit lawyers in the country. This is a real thing. Now  I went one step further and said   Why do we have to stick with the stodgy lawyers and just have a paper document  Let's go online.  And many people might need help in computation. Working with the Harvard Business School  you'll see this example when you talk about minimum payment  If you spent    dollars for a meal  the longer you take to pay out that loan  you see  over a period of time using the minimum payment it's    dollars and    cents. How about that  Do you think your bank is going to show that to people  But it's going to work. It's more effective than just computational aids. And what about terms like  over the limit   Perhaps a stealth thing. Define it in context. Tell people what it means. When you put it in plain English  you almost force the institution to give the people a way  a default out of that  and not put themselves at risk. Plain English is about changing the content. And one of the things I'm most proud of is this agreement for IBM. It's a grid  it's a calendar. At such and such a date  IBM has responsibilities  you have responsibilities. Received very favorably by business. And there is some good news to report today. Each year  one in    taxpayers receives a notice from the IRS. There are     million letters that go out. Running through this typical letter that they had  I ran it through my simplicity lab  it's pretty unintelligible. All the parts of the document in red are not intelligible. We looked at doing over       letters that cover    percent of their transactions in plain English. They have been tested in the laboratory. When I run it through my lab  this heat mapping shows everything is intelligible. And the IRS has introduced the program. There are a couple of things going on right now that I want to bring to your attention. There is a lot of discussion now about a consumer financial protection agency  how to mandate simplicity. We see all this complexity. It's incumbent upon us  and this organization  I believe  to make clarity  transparency and empathy a national priority. There is no way that we should allow government to communicate the way they communicate. There is no way we should do business with companies that have agreements with stealth provisions and that are unintelligible. So  how are we going to change the world  Make clarity  transparency and simplicity a national priority. I thank you. I want to talk about  .  billion years of history in    minutes. That's     million years per minute. Let's start with the first photograph NASA obtained of planet Mars. This is fly by  Mariner IV. It was taken in     . When this picture appeared  that well known scientific journal  The New York Times  wrote in its editorial   Mars is uninteresting. It's a dead world. NASA should not spend any time or effort studying Mars anymore.  Fortunately  our leaders in Washington at NASA headquarters knew better and we began a very extensive study of the red planet. One of the key questions in all of science   Is there life outside of Earth   I believe that Mars is the most likely target for life outside the Earth. I'm going to show you in a few minutes some amazing measurements that suggest there may be life on Mars. But let me start with a Viking photograph. This is a composite taken by Viking in     . Viking was developed and managed at the NASA Langley Research Center. We sent two orbiters and two landers in the summer of     . We had four spacecraft  two around Mars  two on the surface    an amazing accomplishment. This is the first photograph taken from the surface of any planet. This is a Viking Lander photograph of the surface of Mars. And yes  the red planet is red. Mars is half the size of the Earth  but because two thirds of the Earth is covered by water  the land area on Mars is comparable to the land area on Earth. So  Mars is a pretty big place even though it's half the size. We have obtained topographic measurements of the surface of Mars. We understand the elevation differences. We know a lot about Mars. Mars has the largest volcano in the solar system  Olympus Mons. Mars has the Grand Canyon of the solar system  Valles Marineris. Very  very interesting planet. Mars has the largest impact crater in the solar system  Hellas Basin. This is       miles across. If you happened to be on Mars when this impactor hit  it was a really bad day on Mars. This is Olympus Mons. This is bigger than the state of Arizona. Volcanoes are important  because volcanoes produce atmospheres and they produce oceans. We're looking at Valles Marineris  the largest canyon in the solar system  superimposed on a map of the United States        miles across. One of the most intriguing features about Mars  the National Academy of Science says one of the    major mysteries of the space age  is why certain areas of Mars are so highly magnetized. We call this crustal magnetism. There are regions on Mars  where  for some reason    we don't understand why at this point    the surface is very  very highly magnetized. Is there water on Mars  The answer is no  there is no liquid water on the surface of Mars today. But there is intriguing evidence that suggests that the early history of Mars there may have been rivers and fast flowing water. Today Mars is very very dry. We believe there's some water in the polar caps  there are polar caps of North Pole and South Pole. Here are some recent images. This is from Spirit and Opportunity. These images that show at one time  there was very fast flowing water on the surface of Mars. Why is water important  Water is important because if you want life you have to have water. Water is the key ingredient in the evolution  the origin of life on a planet. Here is some picture of Antarctica and a picture of Olympus Mons  very similar features  glaciers. So  this is frozen water. This is ice water on Mars. This is my favorite picture. This was just taken a few weeks ago. It has not been seen publicly. This is European space agency Mars Express  image of a crater on Mars and in the middle of the crater we have liquid water  we have ice. Very intriguing photograph. We now believe that in the early history of Mars  which is  .  billion years ago   .  billion years ago  Mars was very Earth like. Mars had rivers  Mars had lakes  but more important Mars had planetary scale oceans. We believe that the oceans were in the northern hemisphere  and this area in blue  which shows a depression of about four miles  was the ancient ocean area on the surface of Mars. Where did the ocean's worth of water on Mars go  Well  we have an idea. This is a measurement we obtained a few years ago from a Mars orbiting satellite called Odyssey. Sub surface water on Mars  frozen in the form of ice. And this shows the percent. If it's a blueish color  it means    percent by weight. Sixteen percent  by weight  of the interior contains frozen water  or ice. So  there is a lot of water below the surface. The most intriguing and puzzling measurement  in my opinion  we've obtained of Mars  was released earlier this year in the magazine Science. And what we're looking at is the presence of the gas methane  CH   in the atmosphere of Mars. And you can see there are three distinct regions of methane. Why is methane important  Because on Earth  almost all      .  percent    of the methane is produced by living systems  not little green men  but microscopic life below the surface or at the surface. We now have evidence that methane is in the atmosphere of Mars  a gas that  on Earth  is biogenic in origin  produced by living systems. These are the three plumes  A  B   B . And this is the terrain it appears over  and we know from geological studies that these regions are the oldest regions on Mars. In fact  the Earth and Mars are both  .  billion years old. The oldest rock on Earth is only  .  billion. The reason there is a billion year gap in our geological understanding is because of plate tectonics  The crust of the Earth has been recycled. We have no geological record prior for the first billion years. That record exists on Mars. And this terrain that we're looking at dates back to  .  billion years when Earth and Mars were formed. It was a Tuesday. This is a map that shows where we've put our spacecraft on the surface of Mars. Here is Viking I  Viking II. This is Opportunity. This is Spirit. This is Mars Pathfinder. This is Phoenix  we just put two years ago. Notice all of our rovers and all of our landers have gone to the northern hemisphere. That's because the northern hemisphere is the region of the ancient ocean basin. There aren't many craters. And that's because the water protected the basin from being impacted by asteroids and meteorites. But look in the southern hemisphere. In the southern hemisphere there are impact craters  there are volcanic craters. Here's Hellas Basin  a very very different place  geologically. Look where the methane is  the methane is in a very rough terrain area. What is the best way to unravel the mysteries on Mars that exist  We asked this question    years ago. We invited    of the top Mars scientists to the Langley Research Center for two days. We addressed on the board the major questions that have not been answered. And we spent two days deciding how to best answer this question. And the result of our meeting was a robotic rocket powered airplane we call ARES. It's an Aerial Regional scale Environmental Surveyor. There's a model of ARES here. This is a    percent scale model. This airplane was designed at the Langley Research Center. If any place in the world can build an airplane to fly on Mars  it's the Langley Research Center  for almost     years a leading center of aeronautics in the world. We fly about a mile above the surface. We cover hundreds of miles  and we fly about     miles an hour. We can do things that rovers can't do and landers can't do  We can fly above mountains  volcanoes  impact craters  we fly over valleys  we can fly over surface magnetism  the polar caps  subsurface water  and we can search for life on Mars. But  of equal importance  as we fly through the atmosphere of Mars  we transmit that journey  the first flight of an airplane outside of the Earth  we transmit those images back to Earth. And our goal is to inspire the American public who is paying for this mission through tax dollars. But more important we will inspire the next generation of scientists  technologists  engineers and mathematicians. And that's a critical area of national security and economic vitality  to make sure we produce the next generation of scientists  engineers  mathematicians and technologists. This is what ARES looks like as it flies over Mars. We preprogram it. We will fly where the methane is. We will have instruments aboard the plane that will sample  every three minutes  the atmosphere of Mars. We will look for methane as well as other gasses produced by living systems. We will pinpoint where these gases emanate from  because we can measure the gradient where it comes from  and there  we can direct the next mission to land right in that area. How do we transport an airplane to Mars  In two words  very carefully. The problem is we don't fly it to Mars  we put it in a spacecraft and we send it to Mars. The problem is the spacecraft's largest diameter is nine feet  ARES is    foot wingspan     feet long. How do we get it to Mars  We fold it  and we transport it in a spacecraft. And we have it in something called an aeroshell. This is how we do it. And we have a little video that describes the sequence. Video  Seven  six. Green board. Five  four  three  two  one. Main engine start  and liftoff. Joel Levine  This is a launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. This is the spacecraft taking nine months to get to Mars. It enters the atmosphere of Mars. A lot of heating  frictional heating. It's going    thousand miles an hour. A parachute opens up to slow it down. The thermal tiles fall off. The airplane is exposed to the atmosphere for the first time. It unfolds. The rocket engine begins. We believe that in a one hour flight we can rewrite the textbook on Mars by making high resolution measurements of the atmosphere  looking for gases of biogenic origin  looking for gases of volcanic origin  studying the surface  studying the magnetism on the surface  which we don't understand  as well as about a dozen other areas. Practice makes perfect. How do we know we can do it  Because we have tested ARES model  several models in a half a dozen wind tunnels at the NASA Langley Research Center for eight years  under Mars conditions. And  of equal importance is  we test ARES in the Earth's atmosphere  at         feet  which is comparable to the density and pressure of the atmosphere on Mars where we'll fly. Now          feet  if you fly cross country to Los Angeles  you fly        feet. We do our tests at         feet. And I want to show you one of our tests. This is a half scale model. This is a high altitude helium balloon. This is over Tilamook  Oregon. We put the folded airplane on the balloon    it took about three hours to get up there    and then we released it on command at         feet  and we deploy the airplane and everything works perfectly. And we've done high altitude and low altitude tests  just to perfect this technique. We're ready to go. I have a scale model here. But we have a full scale model in storage at the NASA Langley Research Center. We're ready to go. All we need is a check from NASA headquarters to cover the costs. I'm prepared to donate my honorarium for today's talk for this mission. There's actually no honorarium for anyone for this thing. This is the ARES team  we have about     scientists  engineers  where we're working with Jet Propulsion Laboratory  Goddard Space Flight Center  Ames Research Center and half a dozen major universities and corporations in developing this. It's a large effort. It's all at NASA Langley Research Center. And let me conclude by saying not too far from here  right down the road in Kittyhawk  North Carolina  a little more than     years ago history was made when we had the first powered flight of an airplane on Earth. We are on the verge right now to make the first flight of an airplane outside the Earth's atmosphere. We are prepared to fly this on Mars  rewrite the textbook about Mars. If you're interested in more information  we have a website that describes this exciting and intriguing mission  and why we want to do it. Thank you very much. One day  Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez was walking along the streets of downtown Los Angeles when he heard beautiful music. And the source was a man  an African American man  charming  rugged  homeless  playing a violin that only had two strings. And I'm telling a story that many of you know  because Steve's columns became the basis for a book  which was turned into a movie  with Robert Downey Jr. acting as Steve Lopez  and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers  the Juilliard trained double bassist whose promising career was cut short by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia. Nathaniel dropped out of Juilliard  he suffered a complete breakdown  and    years later he was living homeless on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles. I encourage all of you to read Steve's book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bond that formed between these two men  but how music helped shape that bond  and ultimately was instrumental    if you'll pardon the pun    in helping Nathaniel get off the streets. I met Mr. Ayers in       two years ago  at Walt Disney Concert Hall. He had just heard a performance of Beethoven's First and Fourth symphonies  and came backstage and introduced himself. He was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way about Yo Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton and how the Dodgers were never going to make the World Series  all because of the treacherous first violin passage work in the last movement of Beethoven's Fourth Symphony. And we got talking about music  and I got an email from Steve a few days later saying that Nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me. Now  I should mention that Nathaniel refuses treatment because when he was treated it was with shock therapy and Thorazine and handcuffs  and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life. But as a result now  he is prone to these schizophrenic episodes  the worst of which can manifest themselves as him exploding and then disappearing for days  wandering the streets of Skid Row  exposed to its horrors  with the torment of his own mind unleashed upon him. And Nathaniel was in such a state of agitation when we started our first lesson at Walt Disney Concert Hall    he had a kind of manic glint in his eyes  he was lost. And he was talking about invisible demons and smoke  and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep. And I was afraid  not for myself  but I was afraid that I was going to lose him  that he was going to sink into one of his states  and that I would ruin his relationship with the violin if I started talking about scales and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin pedagogy. So  I just started playing. And I played the first movement of the Beethoven Violin Concerto. And as I played  I understood that there was a profound change occurring in Nathaniel's eyes. It was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical  a chemical reaction  for which my playing the music was its catalyst. And Nathaniel's manic rage was transformed into understanding  a quiet curiosity and grace. And in a miracle  he lifted his own violin and he started playing  by ear  certain snippets of violin concertos which he then asked me to complete    Mendelssohn  Tchaikovsky  Sibelius. And we started talking about music  from Bach to Beethoven and Brahms  Bruckner  all the B's  from Bart k  all the way up to Esa Pekka Salonen. And I understood that he not only had an encyclopedic knowledge of music  but he related to this music at a personal level. He spoke about it with the kind of passion and understanding that I share with my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic. And through playing music and talking about music  this man had transformed from the paranoid  disturbed man that had just come from walking the streets of downtown Los Angeles to the charming  erudite  brilliant  Juilliard trained musician. Music is medicine. Music changes us. And for Nathaniel  music is sanity. Because music allows him to take his thoughts and delusions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity  into reality. And that is an escape from his tormented state. And I understood that this was the very essence of art. This was the very reason why we made music  that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental core  our emotions  and through our artistic lens  through our creativity  we're able to shape those emotions into reality. And the reality of that expression reaches all of us and moves us  inspires and unites us. And for Nathaniel  music brought him back into a fold of friends. The redemptive power of music brought him back into a family of musicians that understood him  that recognized his talents and respected him. And I will always make music with Nathaniel  whether we're at Walt Disney Concert Hall or on Skid Row  because he reminds me why I became a musician. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Thank you. Thanks. Robert Gupta. Robert Gupta  I'm going to play something that I shamelessly stole from cellists. So  please forgive me. You know for me  the interest in contemporary forms of slavery started with a leaflet that I picked up in London. It was the early '  s  and I was at a public event. I saw this leaflet and it said   There are millions of slaves in the world today.  And I thought   No way  no way.  And I'm going to admit to hubris. Because I also  I'm going to admit to you  I also thought   How can I be like a hot shot young full professor who teaches human rights and not know this  So it can't be true.  Well  if you teach  if you worship in the temple of learning  do not mock the gods  because they will take you  fill you with curiosity and desire  and drive you. Drive you with a passion to change things. I went out and did a lit review        articles on the key word  slavery.  Two turned out to be about contemporary    only two. All the rest were historical. They were press pieces and they were full of outrage  they were full of speculation  they were anecdotal    no solid information. So  I began to do a research project of my own. I went to five countries around the world. I looked at slaves. I met slaveholders  and I looked very deeply into slave based businesses because this is an economic crime. People do not enslave people to be mean to them. They do it to make a profit. And I've got to tell you  what I found out in the world in four different continents  was depressingly familiar. Like this  Agricultural workers in Africa  whipped and beaten  showing us how they were beaten in the fields before they escaped from slavery and met up with our film crew. It was mind blowing. And I want to be very clear. I'm talking about real slavery. This is not about lousy marriages  this is not about jobs that suck. This is about people who can not walk away  people who are forced to work without pay  people who are operating      under a threat of violence and have no pay. It's real slavery in exactly the same way that slavery would be recognized throughout all of human history. Now  where is it  Well  this map in the sort of redder  yellower colors are the places with the highest densities of slavery. But in fact that kind of bluey color are the countries where we can't find any cases of slavery. And you might notice that it's only Iceland and Greenland where we can't find any cases of enslavement around the world. We're also particularly interested and looking very carefully at places where slaves are being used to perpetrate extreme environmental destruction. Around the world  slaves are used to destroy the environment  cutting down trees in the Amazon  destroying forest areas in West Africa  mining and spreading mercury around in places like Ghana and the Congo  destroying the coastal ecosystems in South Asia. It's a pretty harrowing linkage between what's happening to our environment and what's happening to our human rights. Now  how on Earth did we get to a situation like this  where we have    million people in slavery in the year       That's double the number that came out of Africa in the entire transatlantic slave trade. Well  it builds up with these factors. They are not causal  they are actually supporting factors. One we all know about  the population explosion  the world goes from two billion people to almost seven billion people in the last    years. Being numerous does not make you a slave. Add in the increased vulnerability of very large numbers of people in the developing world  caused by civil wars  ethnic conflicts  kleptocratic governments  disease ... you name it  you know it. We understand how that works. In some countries all of those things happen at once  like Sierra Leone a few years ago  and push enormous parts ... about a billion people in the world  in fact  as we know  live on the edge  live in situations where they don't have any opportunity and are usually even destitute. But that doesn't make you a slave either. What it takes to turn a person who is destitute and vulnerable into a slave  is the absence of the rule of law. If the rule of law is sound  it protects the poor and it protects the vulnerable. But if corruption creeps in and people don't have the opportunity to have that protection of the rule of law  then if you can use violence  if you can use violence with impunity  you can reach out and harvest the vulnerable into slavery. Well  that is precisely what has happened around the world. Though  for a lot of people  the people who step into slavery today don't usually get kidnapped or knocked over the head. They come into slavery because someone has asked them this question. All around the world I've been told an almost identical story. People say   I was home  someone came into our village  they stood up in the back of a truck  they said  'I've got jobs  who needs a job '  And they did exactly what you or I would do in the same situation. They said   That guy looked sketchy. I was suspicious  but my children were hungry. We needed medicine. I knew I had to do anything I could to earn some money to support the people I care about.  They climb into the back of the truck. They go off with the person who recruits them. Ten miles      miles        miles later  they find themselves in dirty  dangerous  demeaning work. They take it for a little while  but when they try to leave  bang   the hammer comes down  and they discover they're enslaved. Now  that kind of slavery is  again  pretty much what slavery has been all through human history. But there is one thing that is particularly remarkable and novel about slavery today  and that is a complete collapse in the price of human beings    expensive in the past  dirt cheap now. Even the business programs have started picking up on this. I just want to share a little clip for you. Daphne  OK. Llively discussion guaranteed here  as always  as we get macro and talk commodities. Continuing here in the studio with our guest Michael O'Donohue  head of commodities at Four Continents Capital Management. And we're also joined by Brent Lawson from Lawson Frisk Securities. Brent Lawson  Happy to be here. D  Good to have you with us  Brent. Now  gentlemen ... Brent  where is your money going this year  BL  Well Daphne  we've been going short on gas and oil recently and casting our net just a little bit wider. We really like the human being story a lot. If you look at a long term chart  prices are at historical lows and yet global demand for forced labor is still real strong. So  that's a scenario that we think we should be capitalizing on. D  Michael  what's your take on the people story  Are you interested  Michael O'Donoghue  Oh definitely. Non voluntary labor's greatest advantage as an asset is the endless supply. We're not about to run out of people. No other commodity has that. BL  Daphne  if I may draw your attention to one thing. That is that private equity has been sniffing around  and that tells me that this market is about to explode. Africans and Indians  as usual  South Americans  and Eastern Europeans in particular are on our buy list. D  Interesting. Micheal  bottom line  what do you recommend  MO  We're recommending to our clients a buy and hold strategy. There's no need to play the market. There's a lot of vulnerable people out there. It's very exciting. D  Exciting stuff indeed. Gentlemen  thank you very much. Kevin Bales  Okay  you figured it out. That's a spoof. Though I enjoyed watching your jaws drop  drop  drop  until you got it. MTV Europe worked with us and made that spoof  and they've been slipping it in between music videos without any introduction  which I think is kind of fun. Here's the reality. The price of human beings across the last       years in today's money has averaged about        dollars. Capital purchase items. You can see that the lines cross when the population explodes. The average price of a human being today  around the world  is about    dollars. They are more expensive in places like North America. Slaves cost between       to       dollars in North America  but I could take you places in India or Nepal where human beings can be acquired for five or    dollars. They key here is that people have ceased to be that capital purchase item and become like Styrofoam cups. You buy them cheaply  you use them  you crumple them up  and then when you're done with them you just throw them away. These young boys are in Nepal. They are basically the transport system on a quarry run by a slaveholder. There are no roads there  so they carry loads of stone on their backs  often of their own weight  up and down the Himalaya Mountains. One of their mothers said to us   You know  we can't survive here  but we can't even seem to die either.  It's a horrible situation. And if there is anything that makes me feel very positive about this  it's that there are also    in addition to young men like this who are still enslaved    there are ex slaves who are now working to free others. Or  we say  Frederick Douglass is in the house. I don't know if you've ever had a daydream about   Wow. What would it be like to meet Harriet Tubman  What would it be like to meet Frederick Douglass   I've got to say  one of the most exciting parts about my job is that I get to  and I want to introduce you to one of those. His name is James Kofi Annan. He was a slave child in Ghana enslaved in the fishing industry  and he now  after escape and building a new life  has formed an organization that we work closely with to go back and get people out of slavery. This is not James  this is one of the kids that he works with. James Kofi Annan  Video   He was hit with a paddle in the head. And this reminds me of my childhood when I used to work here. KB  James and our country director in Ghana  Emmanuel Otoo are now receiving regular death threats because the two of them managed to get convictions and imprisonment for three human traffickers for the very first time in Ghana for enslaving people  from the fishing industry  for enslaving children. Now  everything I've been telling you  I admit  is pretty disheartening. But there is actually a very positive side to this  and that is this  The    million people who are in slavery today  that's a lot of people  but it's also the smallest fraction of the global population to ever be in slavery. And likewise  the    billion dollars that they generate into the global economy each year is the tiniest proportion of the global economy to ever be represented by slave labor. Slavery  illegal in every country has been pushed to the edges of our global society. And in a way  without us even noticing  has ended up standing on the precipice of its own extinction  waiting for us to give it a big boot and knock it over. And get rid of it. And it can be done. Now  if we do that  if we put the resources and the focus to it  what does it actually cost to get people out of slavery  Well  first  before I even tell you the cost I've got to be absolutely clear. We do not buy people out of slavery. Buying people out of slavery is like paying a burglar to get your television back  it's abetting a crime. Liberation  however  costs some money. Liberation  and more importantly all the work that comes after liberation. It's not an event  it's a process. It's about helping people to build lives of dignity  stability  economic autonomy  citizenship. Well  amazingly  in places like India where costs are very low  that family  that three generation family that you see there who were in hereditary slavery    so  that granddad there  was born a baby into slavery    but the total cost  amortized across the rest of the work  was about     dollars to bring that family out of slavery and then take them through a two year process to build a stable life of citizenship and education. A boy in Ghana rescued from fishing slavery  about     dollars. In the United States  North America  much more expensive. Legal costs  medical costs ... we understand that it's expensive here  about        dollars. But most of the people in the world in slavery live in those places where the costs are lowest. And in fact  the global average is about what it is for Ghana. And that means  when you multiply it up  the estimated cost of not just freedom but sustainable freedom for the entire    million people on the planet in slavery is something like   .  billion dollars    what Americans spend on potato chips and pretzels  what Seattle is going to spend on its light rail system  usually the annual expenditure in this country on blue jeans  or in the last holiday period when we bought GameBoys and iPods and other tech gifts for people  we spent   .  billion dollars. Intel's fourth quarter earnings    .  billion. It's not a lot of money at the global level. In fact  it's peanuts. And the great thing about it is that it's not money down a hole  there is a freedom dividend. When you let people out of slavery to work for themselves  are they motivated  They take their kids out of the workplace  they build a school  they say   We're going to have stuff we've never had before like three squares  medicine when we're sick  clothing when we're cold.  They become consumers and producers and local economies begin to spiral up very rapidly. That's important  all of that about how we rebuild sustainable freedom  because we'd never want to repeat what happened in this country in     . Four million people were lifted up out of slavery and then dumped. Dumped without political participation  decent education  any kind of real opportunity in terms of economic lives  and then sentenced to generations of violence and prejudice and discrimination. And America is still paying the price for the botched emancipation of     . We have made a commitment that we will never let people come out of slavery on our watch  and end up as second class citizens. It's just not going to happen. This is what liberation really looks like. Children rescued from slavery in the fishing industry in Ghana  reunited with their parents  and then taken with their parents back to their villages to rebuild their economic well being so that they become slave proof    absolutely unenslaveable. Now  this woman lived in a village in Nepal. We'd been working there about a month. They had just begun to come out of a hereditary kind of slavery. They'd just begun to light up a little bit  open up a little bit. But when we went to speak with her  when we took this photograph  the slaveholders were still menacing us from the sidelines. They hadn't been really pushed back. I was frightened. We were frightened. We said to her   Are you worried  Are you upset   She said   No  because we've got hope now. How could we not succeed   she said   when people like you from the other side of the world are coming here to stand beside us   Okay  we have to ask ourselves  are we willing to live in a world with slavery  If we don't take action  we just leave ourselves open to have someone else jerk the strings that tie us to slavery in the products we buy  and in our government policies. And yet  if there's one thing that every human being can agree on  I think it's that slavery should end. And if there is a fundamental violation of our human dignity that we would all say is horrific  it's slavery. And we've got to say  what good is all of our intellectual and political and economic power    and I'm really thinking intellectual power in this room    if we can't use it to bring slavery to an end  I think there is enough intellectual power in this room to bring slavery to an end. And you know what  If we can't do that  if we can't use our intellectual power to end slavery  there is one last question  Are we truly free  Okay  thank you so much. I'm standing in front of you today in all humility  wanting to share with you my journey of the last six years in the field of service and education. And I'm not a trained academic. Neither am I a veteran social worker. I was    years in the corporate world  trying to make organizations profitable. And then in      I started Parikrma Humanity Foundation from my kitchen table. The first thing that we did was walk through the slums. You know  by the way  there are two million people in Bangalore  who live in     slums. We couldn't go to all the slums  but we tried to cover as much as we could. We walked through these slums  identified houses where children would never go to school. We talked to the parents  tried to convince them about sending their children to school. We played with the children  and came back home really tired  exhausted  but with images of bright faces  twinkling eyes  and went to sleep. We were all excited to start  but the numbers hit us then      million children between four to    that should be going to school  but do not      million children who go to school but cannot read      million who cannot do basic maths. We also heard that     billion Indian rupees was dedicated for government schooling. Ninety percent of it was spent on teachers' salary and administrators' salary. And yet  India has nearly the highest teacher absenteeism in the world  with one out of four teachers not going to school at all the entire academic year. Those numbers were absolutely mind boggling  overwhelming  and we were constantly asked   When will you start  How many schools will you start  How many children will you get  How are you going to scale  How are you going to replicate   It was very difficult not to get scared  not to get daunted. But we dug our heels and said   We're not in the number game. We want to take one child at a time and take the child right through school  sent to college  and get them prepared for better living  a high value job.  So  we started Parikrma. The first Parikrma school started in a slum where there were        people living below the poverty line. Our first school was on a rooftop of a building inside the slums  a second story building  the only second story building inside the slums. And that rooftop did not have any ceiling  only half a tin sheet. That was our first school. One hundred sixty five children. Indian academic year begins in June. So  June it rains  so many a times all of us would be huddled under the tin roof  waiting for the rain to stop. My God  What a bonding exercise that was. And all of us that were under that roof are still here together today. Then came the second school  the third school  the fourth school and a junior college. In six years now  we have four schools  one junior college        children coming from    slums and four orphanages. Our dream is very simple  to send each of these kids  get them prepared to be educated but also to live peacefully  contented in this conflict ridden chaotic globalized world. Now  when you talk global you have to talk English. And so all our schools are English medium schools. But they know there is this myth that children from the slums cannot speak English well. No one in their family has spoken English. No one in their generation has spoken English. But how wrong it is. Girl  I like adventurous books  and some of my favorites are Alfred Hitchcock and  unclear  and Hardy Boys. Although they are like in different contexts  one is magical  the other two are like investigation  I like those books because they have something special in them. The vocabulary used in those books and the style of writing. I mean like once I pick up one book I cannot put it down until I finish the whole book. Even if it takes me four and a half hours  or three and half hours to finish my book  I do it. Boy  I did good research and I got the information  on the  world's fastest cars. I like Ducati ZZ     because it is the fastest  the world's fastest bike  and I like Pulsar     DTSI because it is India's fastest bike.  Laughter  Shukla Bose  Well  that girl that you saw  her father sells flowers on the roadside. And this little boy has been coming to school for five years. But isn't it strange that little boys all over the world love fast bikes   Laughter  He hasn't seen one  he hasn't ridden one  of course  but he has done a lot of research through Google search. You know  when we started with our English medium schools we also decided to adopt the best curriculum possible  the ICSE curriculum. And again  there were people who laughed at me and said   Don't be crazy choosing such a tough curriculum for these students. They'll never be able to cope.  Not only do our children cope very well  but they excel in it. You should just come across to see how well our children do. There is also this myth that parents from the slums are not interested in their children going to school  they'd much rather put them to work. That's absolute hogwash. All parents all over the world want their children to lead a better life than themselves  but they need to believe that change is possible. Video   Hindi  SB  We have    percent attendance for all our parents teachers meeting. Sometimes it's even     percent  much more than many privileged schools. Fathers have started to attend. It's very interesting. When we started our school the parents would give thumbprints in the attendance register. Now they have started writing their signature. The children have taught them. It's amazing how much children can teach. We have  a few months ago  actually late last year  we had a few mothers who came to us and said   You know  we want to learn how to read and write. Can you teach us   So  we started an afterschool for our parents  for our mothers. We had    mothers who came regularly after school to study. We want to continue with this program and extend it to all our other schools. Ninety eight percent of our fathers are alcoholics. So  you can imagine how traumatized and how dysfunctional the houses are where our children come from. We have to send the fathers to de addiction labs and when they come back  most times sober  we have to find a job for them so that they don't regress. We have about three fathers who have been trained to cook. We have taught them nutrition  hygiene. We have helped them set up the kitchen and now they are supplying food to all our children. They do a very good job because their children are eating their food  but most importantly this is the first time they have got respect  and they feel that they are doing something worthwhile. More than    percent of our non teaching staff are all parents and extended families. We've started many programs just to make sure that the child comes to school. Vocational skill program for the older siblings so the younger ones are not stopped from coming to school. There is also this myth that children from the slums cannot integrate with mainstream. Take a look at this little girl who was one of the    children from all privileged schools  best schools in the country that was selected for the Duke University talent identification program and was sent to IIM Ahmedabad. Video  Girl  Duke IIMA Camp. Whenever we see that IIMA  it was such a pride for us to go to that camp. Everybody was very friendly  especially I got a lot of friends. And I felt that my English has improved a lot going there and chatting with friends. There they met children who are with a different standard and a different mindset  a totally different society. I mingled with almost everyone. They were very friendly. I had very good friends there  who are from Delhi  who are from Mumbai. Even now we are in touch through Facebook. After this Ahmedabad trip I've been like a totally different mingling with people and all of those. Before that I feel like I wasn't like this. I don't even mingle  or start speaking with someone so quickly. My accent with English improved a lot. And I learned football  volleyball  Frisbee  lots of games. And I wouldn't want to go to Bangalore. Let me stay here. Such beautiful food  I enjoyed it. It was so beautiful. I enjoyed eating food like  unclear  would come and ask me   Yes ma'am  what you want   It was so good to hear  SB  This girl was working as a maid before she came to school. And today she wants to be a neurologist. Our children are doing brilliantly in sports. They are really excelling. There is an inter school athletic competition that is held every year in Bangalore  where       children participate from     best schools in the city. We've got the best school award for three years successively. And our children are coming back home with bags full of medals  with lots of admirers and friends. Last year there were a couple of kids from elite schools that came to ask for admissions in our school. We also have our very own dream team. Why is this happening  Why this confidence  Is it the exposure  We have professors from MIT  Berkeley  Stanford  Indian Institute of Science who come and teach our children lots of scientific formulas  experiments  much beyond the classroom. Art  music are considered therapy and mediums of expression. We also believe that it's the content that is more important. It is not the infrastructure  not the toilets  not the libraries  but it is what actually happens in this school that is more important. Creating an environment of learning  of inquiry  of exploration is what is true education. When we started Parikrma we had no idea which direction we were taking. We didn't hire McKinsey to do a business plan. But we know for sure that what we want to do today is take one child at a time  not get bogged with numbers  and actually see the child complete the circle of life  and unleash his total potential. We do not believe in scale because we believe in quality  and scale and numbers will automatically happen. We have corporates that have stood behind us  and we are able to  now  open more schools. But we began with the idea of one child at a time. This is five year old Parusharam. He was begging by a bus stop a few years ago  got picked up and is now in an orphanage  has been coming to school for the last four and a half months. He's in kindergarten. He has learned how to speak English. We have a model by which kids can speak English and understand English in three month's time. He can tell you stories in English of the thirsty crow  of the crocodile and of the giraffe. And if you ask him what he likes to do he will say   I like sleeping. I like eating. I like playing.  And if you ask him what he wants to do  he will say   I want to horsing.  Now   horsing  is going for a horse ride. So  Parusharam comes to my office every day. He comes for a tummy rub  because he believes that will give me luck.  Laughter  When I started Parikrma I began with a great deal of arrogance of transforming the world. But today I have been transformed. I have been changed with my children. I've learned so much from them  love  compassion  imagination and such creativity. Parusharam is Parikrma with a simple beginning but a long way to go. I promise you  Parusharam will speak in the TED conference a few years from now. Thank you. We are drowning in news. Reuters alone puts out three and a half million news stories a year. That's just one source. My question is  How many of those stories are actually going to matter in the long run  That's the idea behind The Long News. It's a project by The Long Now Foundation  which was founded by TEDsters including Kevin Kelly and Stewart Brand. And what we're looking for is news stories that might still matter    or     or        years from now. And when you look at the news through that filter  a lot falls by the wayside. To take the top stories from the A.P. this last year  is this going to matter in a decade  Or this  Or this  Really  Is this going to matter in    or     years  Okay  that was kind of cool. But the top story of this past year was the economy  and I'm just betting that  sooner or later  this particular recession is going to be old news. So  what kind of stories might make a difference for the future  Well  let's take science. Someday  little robots will go through our bloodstreams fixing things. That someday is already here if you're a mouse. Some recent stories  nanobees zap tumors with real bee venom  they're sending genes into the brain  a robot they built that can crawl through the human body. What about resources  How are we going to feed nine billion people  We're having trouble feeding six billion today. As we heard yesterday  there's over a billion people hungry. Britain will starve without genetically modified crops. Bill Gates  fortunately  has bet a billion on  agricultural  research. What about global politics  The world's going to be very different when and if China sets the agenda  and they may. They've overtaken the U.S. as the world's biggest car market  they've overtaken Germany as the largest exporter  and they've started doing DNA tests on kids to choose their careers. We're finding all kinds of ways to push back the limits of what we know. Some recent discoveries  There's an ant colony from Argentina that has now spread to every continent but Antarctica  there's a self directed robot scientist that's made a discovery    soon  science may no longer need us  and life may no longer need us either  a microbe wakes up after         years. It seems that with or without us  life will go on. But my pick for the top Long News story of this past year was this one  water found on the moon. Makes it a lot easier to put a colony up there. And if NASA doesn't do it  China might  or somebody in this room might write a big check. My point is this  In the long run  some news stories are more important than others. Ladies and gentlemen  at TED we talk a lot about leadership and how to make a movement. So let's watch a movement happen  start to finish  in under three minutes and dissect some lessons from it. First  of course you know  a leader needs the guts to stand out and be ridiculed. What he's doing is so easy to follow. Here's his first follower with a crucial role  he's going to show everyone else how to follow. Now  notice that the leader embraces him as an equal. Now it's not about the leader anymore  it's about them  plural. Now  there he is calling to his friends. Now  if you notice that the first follower is actually an underestimated form of leadership in itself. It takes guts to stand out like that. The first follower is what transforms a lone nut into a leader. And here comes a second follower. Now it's not a lone nut  it's not two nuts    three is a crowd  and a crowd is news. So a movement must be public. It's important to show not just the leader  but the followers  because you find that new followers emulate the followers  not the leader. Now  here come two more people  and immediately after  three more people. Now we've got momentum. This is the tipping point. Now we've got a movement. So  notice that  as more people join in  it's less risky. So those that were sitting on the fence before now have no reason not to. They won't stand out  they won't be ridiculed  but they will be part of the in crowd if they hurry. So  over the next minute  you'll see all of those that prefer to stick with the crowd because eventually they would be ridiculed for not joining in. And that's how you make a movement. But let's recap some lessons from this. So first  if you are the type  like the shirtless dancing guy that is standing alone  remember the importance of nurturing your first few followers as equals so it's clearly about the movement  not you. Okay  but we might have missed the real lesson here. The biggest lesson  if you noticed    did you catch it     is that leadership is over glorified. Yes  it was the shirtless guy who was first  and he'll get all the credit  but it was really the first follower that transformed the lone nut into a leader. So  as we're told that we should all be leaders  that would be really ineffective. If you really care about starting a movement  have the courage to follow and show others how to follow. And when you find a lone nut doing something great  have the guts to be the first one to stand up and join in. And what a perfect place to do that  at TED. Thanks. Now  I want to start with a question  When was the last time you were called  childish   For kids like me  being called childish can be a frequent occurrence. Every time we make irrational demands  exhibit irresponsible behavior  or display any other signs of being normal American citizens  we are called childish. Which really bothers me. After all  take a look at these events  Imperialism and colonization  world wars  George W. Bush. Ask yourself  who's responsible  Adults. Now  what have kids done  Well  Anne Frank touched millions with her powerful account of the Holocaust. Ruby Bridges helped to end segregation in the United States. And  most recently  Charlie Simpson helped to raise         pounds for Haiti  on his little bike. So as you can see evidenced by such examples  age has absolutely nothing to do with it. The traits the word  childish  addresses are seen so often in adults  that we should abolish this age discriminatory word  when it comes to criticizing behavior associated with irresponsibility and irrational thinking. Thank you. Then again  who's to say that certain types of irrational thinking aren't exactly what the world needs  Maybe you've had grand plans before  but stopped yourself  thinking   That's impossible   or  That costs too much   or  That won't benefit me.  For better or worse  we kids aren't hampered as much when it comes to thinking about reasons why not to do things. Kids can be full of inspiring aspirations and hopeful thinking  like my wish that no one went hungry  or that everything were free  a kind of utopia. How many of you still dream like that  and believe in the possibilities  Sometimes a knowledge of history and the past failures of Utopian ideals can be a burden  because you know that if everything were free  then the food stocks would become depleted and scarce and lead to chaos. On the other hand  we kids still dream about perfection. And that's a good thing  because in order to make anything a reality  you have to dream about it first. In many ways  our audacity to imagine helps push the boundaries of possibility. For instance  the Museum of Glass in Tacoma  Washington  my home state    yoohoo  Washington  has a program called Kids Design Glass  and kids draw their own ideas for glass art. The resident artist said they got some of their best ideas from the program  because kids don't think about the limitations of how hard it can be to blow glass into certain shapes  they just think of good ideas. Now  when you think of glass  you might think of colorful Chihuly designs  or maybe Italian vases  but kids challenge glass artists to go beyond that  into the realm of brokenhearted snakes and bacon boys  who you can see has meat vision. Now  our inherent wisdom doesn't have to be insider's knowledge. Kids already do a lot of learning from adults  and we have a lot to share. I think that adults should start learning from kids. Now  I do most of my speaking in front of an education crowd    teachers and students  and I like this analogy  It shouldn't be a teacher at the head of the class  telling students   Do this  do that.  The students should teach their teachers. Learning between grown ups and kids should be reciprocal. The reality  unfortunately  is a little different  and it has a lot to do with trust  or a lack of it. Now  if you don't trust someone  you place restrictions on them  right  If I doubt my older sister's ability to pay back the    percent interest I established on her last loan  I'm going to withhold her ability to get more money from me  until she pays it back. True story  by the way. Now  adults seem to have a prevalently restrictive attitude towards kids  from every  Don't do that  don't do this  in the school handbook  to restrictions on school Internet use. As history points out  regimes become oppressive when they're fearful about keeping control. And although adults may not be quite at the level of totalitarian regimes  kids have no or very little say in making the rules  when really  the attitude should be reciprocal  meaning that the adult population should learn and take into account the wishes of the younger population. Now  what's even worse than restriction  is that adults often underestimate kids' abilities. We love challenges  but when expectations are low  trust me  we will sink to them. My own parents had anything but low expectations for me and my sister. Okay  so they didn't tell us to become doctors or lawyers or anything like that  but my dad did read to us about Aristotle and pioneer germ fighters  when lots of other kids were hearing  The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round.  Well  we heard that one too  but  Pioneer Germ Fighters  totally rules. I loved to write from the age of four  and when I was six  my mom bought me my own laptop equipped with Microsoft Word. Thank you  Bill Gates  and thank you  Ma. I wrote over     short stories on that little laptop  and I wanted to get published. Instead of just scoffing at this heresy that a kid wanted to get published  or saying wait until you're older  my parents were really supportive. Many publishers were not quite so encouraging. One large children's publisher ironically said that they didn't work with children. Children's publisher not working with children  I don't know  you're kind of alienating a large client there. One publisher  Action Publishing  was willing to take that leap and trust me  and to listen to what I had to say. They published my first book   Flying Fingers   you see it here. And from there on  it's gone to speaking at hundreds of schools  keynoting to thousands of educators  and finally  today  speaking to you. I appreciate your attention today  because to show that you truly care  you listen. But there's a problem with this rosy picture of kids being so much better than adults. Kids grow up and become adults just like you. Or just like you  Really  The goal is not to turn kids into your kind of adult  but rather  better adults than you have been  which may be a little challenging  considering your guys' credentials. But the way progress happens  is because new generations and new eras grow and develop and become better than the previous ones. It's the reason we're not in the Dark Ages anymore. No matter your position or place in life  it is imperative to create opportunities for children  so that we can grow up to blow you away. Adults and fellow TEDsters  you need to listen and learn from kids  and trust us and expect more from us. You must lend an ear today  because we are the leaders of tomorrow  which means we're going to take care of you when you're old and senile. No  just kidding. No  really  we are going to be the next generation  the ones who will bring this world forward. And in case you don't think that this really has meaning for you  remember that cloning is possible  and that involves going through childhood again  in which case you'll want to be heard  just like my generation. Now  the world needs opportunities for new leaders and new ideas. Kids need opportunities to lead and succeed. Are you ready to make the match  Because the world's problems shouldn't be the human family's heirloom. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  People do stupid things. That's what spreads HIV.  This was a headline in a U.K. newspaper  The Guardian  not that long ago. I'm curious  show of hands  who agrees with it  Well  one or two brave souls. This is actually a direct quote from an epidemiologist who's been in field of HIV for    years  worked on four continents  and you're looking at her. And I am now going to argue that this is only half true. People do get HIV because they do stupid things  but most of them are doing stupid things for perfectly rational reasons. Now   rational  is the dominant paradigm in public health  and if you put your public health nerd glasses on  you'll see that if we give people the information that they need about what's good for them and what's bad for them  if you give them the services that they can use to act on that information  and a little bit of motivation  people will make rational decisions and live long and healthy lives. Wonderful. That's slightly problematic for me because I work in HIV  and although I'm sure you all know that HIV is about poverty and gender inequality  and if you were at TED '   it's about coffee prices ... Actually  HIV's about sex and drugs  and if there are two things that make human beings a little bit irrational  they are erections and addiction. So  let's start with what's rational for an addict. Now  I remember speaking to an Indonesian friend of mine  Frankie. We were having lunch and he was telling me about when he was in jail in Bali for a drug injection. It was someone's birthday  and they had very kindly smuggled some heroin into jail  and he was very generously sharing it out with all of his colleagues. And so everyone lined up  all the smackheads in a row  and the guy whose birthday it was filled up the fit  and he went down and started injecting people. So he injects the first guy  and then he's wiping the needle on his shirt  and he injects the next guy. And Frankie says   I'm number    in line  and I can see the needle coming down towards me  and there is blood all over the place. It's getting blunter and blunter. And a small part of my brain is thinking  'That is so gross and really dangerous ' but most of my brain is thinking  'Please let there be some smack left by the time it gets to me. Please let there be some left.'  And then  telling me this story  Frankie said   You know ... God  drugs really make you stupid.  And  you know  you can't fault him for accuracy. But  actually  Frankie  at that time  was a heroin addict and he was in jail. So his choice was either to accept that dirty needle or not to get high. And if there's one place you really want to get high  it's when you're in jail. But I'm a scientist and I don't like to make data out of anecdotes  so let's look at some data. We talked to     drug addicts in three cities in Indonesia  and we said   Well  do you know how you get HIV    Oh yeah  by sharing needles.  I mean  nearly     percent. Yeah  by sharing needles. And   Do you know where you can get a clean needle at a price you can afford to avoid that    Oh yeah.  Hundred percent.  We're smackheads  we know where to get clean needles.   So are you carrying a needle   We're actually interviewing people on the street  in the places where they're hanging out and taking drugs.  Are you carrying clean needles   One in four  maximum. So no surprises then that the proportion that actually used clean needles every time they injected in the last week is just about one in     and the other nine in    are sharing. So you've got this massive mismatch  everyone knows that if they share they're going to get HIV  but they're all sharing anyway. So what's that about  Is it like you get a better high if you share or something  We asked that to a junkie and they're like   Are you nuts   You don't want to share a needle anymore than you want to share a toothbrush even with someone you're sleeping with. There's just kind of an ick factor there.  No  no. We share needles because we don't want to go to jail.  So  in Indonesia at this time  if you were carrying a needle and the cops rounded you up  they could put you into jail. And that changes the equation slightly  doesn't it  Because your choice now is either I use my own needle now  or I could share a needle now and get a disease that's going to possibly kill me    years from now  or I could use my own needle now and go to jail tomorrow. And while junkies think that it's a really bad idea to expose themselves to HIV  they think it's a much worse idea to spend the next year in jail where they'll probably end up in Frankie's situation and expose themselves to HIV anyway. So  suddenly it becomes perfectly rational to share needles. Now  let's look at it from a policy maker's point of view. This is a really easy problem. For once  your incentives are aligned. We've got what's rational for public health. You want people to use clean needles    and junkies want to use clean needles. So we could make this problem go away simply by making clean needles universally available and taking away the fear of arrest. Now  the first person to figure that out and do something about it on a national scale was that well known  bleeding heart liberal Margaret Thatcher. And she put in the world's first national needle exchange program  and other countries followed suit  Australia  The Netherlands and few others. And in all of those countries  you can see  not more than four percent of injectors ever became infected with HIV. Now  places that didn't do this    New York City for example  Moscow  Jakarta    we're talking  at its peak  one in two injectors infected with this fatal disease. Now  Margaret Thatcher didn't do this because she has any great love for junkies. She did it because she ran a country that had a national health service. So  if she didn't invest in effective prevention  she was going to have pick up the costs of treatment later on  and obviously those are much higher. So she was making a politically rational decision. Now  if I take out my public health nerd glasses here and look at these data  it seems like a no brainer  doesn't it  But in this country  where the government apparently does not feel compelled to provide health care for citizens   Laughter  we've taken a very different approach. So what we've been doing in the United States is reviewing the data    endlessly reviewing the data. So  these are reviews of hundreds of studies by all the big muckety mucks of the scientific pantheon in the United States  and these are the studies that show needle programs are effective    quite a lot of them. Now  the ones that show that needle programs aren't effective    you think that's one of these annoying dynamic slides and I'm going to press my dongle and the rest of it's going to come up  but no    that's the whole slide. There is nothing on the other side. So  completely irrational  you would think. Except that  wait a minute  politicians are rational  too  and they're responding to what they think the voters want. So what we see is that voters respond very well to things like this and not quite so well to things like this. So it becomes quite rational to deny services to injectors. Now let's talk about sex. Are we any more rational about sex  Well  I'm not even going to address the clearly irrational positions of people like the Catholic Church  who think somehow that if you give out condoms  everyone's going to run out and have sex. I don't know if Pope Benedict watches TEDTalks online  but if you do  I've got news for you Benedict    I carry condoms all the time and I never get laid. It's not that easy  Here  maybe you'll have better luck. Okay  seriously  HIV is actually not that easy to transmit sexually. So  it depends on how much virus there is in your blood and in your body fluids. And what we've got is a very  very high level of virus right at the beginning when you're first infected  then you start making antibodies  and then it bumps along at quite low levels for a long time       or    years    you have spikes if you get another sexually transmitted infection. But basically  nothing much is going on until you start to get symptomatic AIDS  and by that stage  you're not looking great  you're not feeling great  you're not having that much sex. So the sexual transmission of HIV is essentially determined by how many partners you have in these very short spaces of time when you have peak viremia. Now  this makes people crazy because it means that you have to talk about some groups having more sexual partners in shorter spaces of time than other groups  and that's considered stigmatizing. I've always been a bit curious about that because I think stigma is a bad thing  whereas lots of sex is quite a good thing  but we'll leave that be. The truth is that    years of very good research have shown us that there are groups that are more likely to turnover large numbers of partners in a short space of time. And those groups are  globally  people who sell sex and their more regular partners. They are gay men on the party scene who have  on average  three times more partners than straight people on the party scene. And they are heterosexuals who come from countries that have traditions of polygamy and relatively high levels of female autonomy  and almost all of those countries are in east or southern Africa. And that is reflected in the epidemic that we have today. You can see these horrifying figures from Africa. These are all countries in southern Africa where between one in seven  and one in three of all adults  are infected with HIV. Now  in the rest of the world  we've got basically nothing going on in the general population    very  very low levels    but we have extraordinarily high levels of HIV in these other populations who are at highest risk  drug injectors  sex workers and gay men. And you'll note  that's the local data from Los Angeles     percent prevalence among gay men. Of course  you can't get HIV just by having unprotected sex. You can only HIV by having unprotected sex with a positive person. In most of the world  these few prevention failures notwithstanding  we are actually doing quite well these days in commercial sex  condom use rates are between    and     percent in commercial sex in most countries. And  again  it's because of an alignment of the incentives. What's rational for public health is also rational for individual sex workers because it's really bad for business to have another STI. No one wants it. And  actually  clients don't want to go home with a drip either. So essentially  you're able to achieve quite high rates of condom use in commercial sex. But in  intimate  relations it's much more difficult because  with your wife or your boyfriend or someone that you hope might turn into one of those things  we have this illusion of romance and trust and intimacy  and nothing is quite so unromantic as the   My condom or yours  darling   question. So in the face of that  you really need quite a strong incentive to use condoms. This  for example  this gentleman is called Joseph. He's from Haiti and he has AIDS. And he's probably not having a lot of sex right now  but he is a reminder in the population  of why you might want to be using condoms. This is also in Haiti and is a reminder of why you might want to be having sex  perhaps. Now  funnily enough  this is also Joseph after six months on antiretroviral treatment. Not for nothing do we call it the Lazarus Effect. But it is changing the equation of what's rational in sexual decision making. So  what we've got    some people say   Oh  it doesn't matter very much because  actually  treatment is effective prevention because it lowers your viral load and therefore makes it more difficult to transmit HIV.  So  if you look at the viremia thing again  if you do start treatment when you're sick  well  what happens  Your viral load comes down. But compared to what  What happens if you're not on treatment  Well  you die  so your viral load goes to zero. And all of this green stuff here  including the spikes    which are because you couldn't get to the pharmacy  or you ran out of drugs  or you went on a three day party binge and forgot to take your drugs  or because you've started to get resistance  or whatever    all of that is virus that wouldn't be out there  except for treatment. Now  am I saying   Oh  well  great prevention strategy. Let's just stop treating people.  Of course not  of course not. We need to expand antiretroviral treatment as much as we can. But what I am doing is calling into question those people who say that more treatment is all the prevention we need. That's simply not necessarily true  and I think we can learn a lot from the experience of gay men in rich countries where treatment has been widely available for going on    years now. And what we've seen is that  actually  condom use rates  which were very  very high    the gay community responded very rapidly to HIV  with extremely little help from public health nerds  I would say    that condom use rate has come down dramatically since treatment for two reasons really  One is the assumption of   Oh well  if he's infected  he's probably on meds  and his viral load's going to be low  so I'm pretty safe.  And the other thing is that people are simply not as scared of HIV as they were of AIDS  and rightly so. AIDS was a disfiguring disease that killed you  and HIV is an invisible virus that makes you take a pill every day. And that's boring  but is it as boring as having to use a condom every time you have sex  no matter how drunk you are  no matter how many poppers you've taken  whatever  If we look at the data  we can see that the answer to that question is  mmm. So these are data from Scotland. You see the peak in drug injectors before they started the national needle exchange program. Then it came way down. And both in heterosexuals    mostly in commercial sex    and in drug users  you've really got nothing much going on after treatment begins  and that's because of that alignment of incentives that I talked about earlier. But in gay men  you've got quite a dramatic rise starting three or four years after treatment became widely available. This is of new infections. What does that mean  It means that the combined effect of being less worried and having more virus out there in the population    more people living longer  healthier lives  more likely to be getting laid with HIV    is outweighing the effects of lower viral load  and that's a very worrisome thing. What does it mean  It means we need to be doing more prevention the more treatment we have. Is that what's happening  No  and I call it the  compassion conundrum.  We've talked a lot about compassion the last couple of days  and what's happening really is that people are unable quite to bring themselves to put in good sexual and reproductive health services for sex workers  unable quite to be giving out needles to junkies. But once they've gone from being transgressive people whose behaviors we don't want to condone to being AIDS victims  we come over all compassionate and buy them incredibly expensive drugs for the rest of their lives. It doesn't make any sense from a public health point of view. I want to give what's very nearly the last word to Ines. Ines is a a transgender hooker on the streets of Jakarta  she's a chick with a dick. Why does she do that job  Well  of course  because she's forced into it because she doesn't have any better option  etc.  etc. And if we could just teach her to sew and get her a nice job in a factory  all would be well. This is what factory workers earn in an hour in Indonesia  on average     cents. It varies a bit province to province. I do speak to sex workers         of them for this particular slide  and this is what sex workers say they earn in an hour. So it's not a great job  but for a lot of people it really is quite a rational choice. Okay  Ines. We've got the tools  the knowledge and the cash  and commitment to preventing HIV too. Ines  So why is prevalence still rising  It's all politics. When you get to politics  nothing makes sense. Elizabeth Pisani   When you get to politics  nothing makes sense.  So  from the point of view of a sex worker  politicians are making no sense. From the point of view of a public health nerd  junkies are doing dumb things. The truth is that everyone has a different rationale. There are as many different ways of being rational as there are human beings on the planet  and that's one of the glories of human existence. But those ways of being rational are not independent of one another  so it's rational for a drug injector to share needles because of a stupid decision that's made by a politician  and it's rational for a politician to make that stupid decision because they're responding to what they think the voters want. But here's the thing  we are the voters. We're not all of them  of course  but TED is a community of opinion leaders. And everyone who's in this room  and everyone who's watching this out there on the web  I think  has a duty to demand of their politicians that we make policy based on scientific evidence and on common sense. It's going to be really hard for us to individually affect what's rational for every Frankie and every Ines out there  but you can at least use your vote to stop politicians doing stupid things that spread HIV. Thank you. It's not about technology  it's about people and stories. I could show you what recently was on television as a high quality video     Minutes  many of you may have seen it. And it was the now director of the entire piece of the veteran's administration    who  himself  had lost an arm    years ago in Vietnam    who was adamantly opposed to these crazy devices that don't work. And it turns out that with    Minutes cameras rolling in the background  after he pretty much made his position clear on this    he had his hook and he had his    he wore this arm for less than two hours and was able to pour himself a drink and got quite emotional over the fact that  quote    his quote    it's the first time he's felt like he's had an arm in    years. But that would sort of be jumping to the middle of the story  and I'm not going to show you that polished video. I'm going to  instead  in a minute or two  show you an early  crude video because I think it's a better way to tell a story. A few years ago I was visited by the guy that runs DARPA  the people that fund all the advanced technologies that businesses and universities probably wouldn't take the risk of doing. They have a particular interest in ones that will help our soldiers. I get this sort of unrequested    by me anyway    visit  and sitting in my conference room is a very senior surgeon from the military and the guy that runs DARPA. They proceed to tell me a story which comes down to basically the following. We have used such advanced technologies now and made them available in the most remote places that we put soldiers  hills of Afghanistan  Iraq ... They were quite proud of the fact that you know  before the dust clears  if some soldier has been hurt they will have collected him or her  they will have brought him back  they will be getting world class triage emergency care faster than you and I would be getting it if we were hurt in a car accident in a major city in the United States. That's the good news. The bad news is if they've collected this person and he or she is missing an arm or leg  part of the face  it's probably not coming back. So  they started giving me the statistics on how many of these kids had lost an arm. And then the surgeon pointed out  with a lot of anger  he said   Why is it  At the end of the Civil War  they were shooting each other with muskets. If somebody lost an arm  we gave them a wooden stick with a hook on it. Now we've got F  s and F  s  and if somebody loses an arm  we give them a plastic stick with a hook on it.  And they basically said   This is unacceptable   and then the punchline   So  Dean  we're here because you make medical stuff. You're going to give us an arm.  And I was waiting for the     pages of bureaucracy  paperwork and DODs. No  the guy says   We're going to bring a guy into this conference room  and wearing the arm you're going to give us  he or she is going to pick up a raisin or a grape off this table. If it's the grape  they won't break it.  Great he needs efferent  afferent  haptic response sensors.  If it's the raisin  they won't drop it.  So he wants fine motor control  flex at the wrist  flex at the elbow  abduct and flex at the shoulder. Either way they were going to eat it.  Oh  by the way Dean. It's going to fit on a   th percentile female frame    namely    inches from the long finger    and weigh less than nine pounds.    th percentile female frame.  And it's going to be completely self contained including all its power.  So  they finished that. And I  as you can tell  am a bashful guy. I told them they're nuts. They've been watching too much  Terminator.  Then  the surgeon says to me   Dean  you need to know more than two dozen of these kids have come back bilateral.  Now  I cannot imagine    I'm sorry  you may have a better imagination than I do    I can't imagine losing my arm  and typically at    years old. But compared to that  losing two  Seems like that would be an inconvenience. Anyway  I went home that night. I thought about it. I literally could not sleep thinking about   I wonder how you'd roll over with no shoulders.  So  I decided we've got to do this. And trust me  I've got a day job  I've got a lot of day jobs. Most of my day job keeps me busy funding my fantasies like FIRST and water and power .... And I've got a lot of day jobs. But I figured I gotta do this. Did a little investigation  went down to Washington  told them I still think they're nuts but we're going to do it. And I told them I'd build them an arm. I told them it would probably take five years to get through the FDA  and probably    years to be reasonably functional. Look what it takes to make things like iPods.  Great   he said   You got two years.  I said   I'll tell you what. I'll build you an arm that's under nine pounds that has all that capability in one year. It will take the other nine to make it functional and useful.  We sort of agreed to disagree. I went back and I started putting a team together  the best guys I could find with a passion to do this. At the end of exactly one year we had a device with    degrees of freedom  all the sensors  all the microprocessors  all the stuff inside. I could show you it with a cosmesis on it that's so real it's eerie  but then you wouldn't see all this cool stuff. I then thought it would be years before we'd be able to make it really  really useful. It turned out  as I think you could see in Aimee's capabilities and attitudes  people with a desire to do something are quite remarkable and nature is quite adaptable. Anyway  with less than    hours of use  two guys    one that's bilateral. He's literally  he's got no shoulder on one side  and he's high trans humeral on the other. And that's Chuck and Randy together  after    hours    were playing in our office. And we took some pretty cruddy home movies. At the end of the one I'm going to show  it's only about a minute and a couple of seconds long  Chuck does something that to this day I'm jealous of  I can't do it. He picks up a spoon  picks it up  scoops out some Shredded Wheat and milk  holds the spoon level as he translates it  moving all these joints simultaneously  to his mouth  and he doesn't drop any milk. I cannot do that. His wife was standing behind me. She's standing behind me at the time and she says   Dean  Chuck hasn't fed himself in    years. So  you've got a choice  We keep the arm  or you keep Chuck.  So  can we see that  This is Chuck showing simultaneous control of all the joints. He's punching our controls guy. The guy behind him is our engineer surgeon  which is a convenient guy to have around. There's Randy  these guys are passing a rubber little puck between them. And just as in the spirit of FIRST  gracious professionalism  they are quite proud of this  so they decide to share a drink. This is a non trivial thing to do  by the way. Imagine doing that with a wooden stick and a hook on the end of it  doing either of those. Now Chuck is doing something quite extraordinary  at least for my limited physical skill. And now he's going to do what DARPA asked me for. He's going to pick up a grape    he didn't drop it  he didn't break it    and he's going to eat it. So  that's where we were at the end of about    months. But  as I've learned from Richard  the technology  the processors  the sensors  the motors  is not the story. I hadn't dealt with this kind of problem or frankly  this whole segment of the medical world. I'll give you some astounding things that have happened as we started this. After we were pretty much convinced we had a good design  and we'd have to make all the standard engineering trade offs you always make    you can always get three out of four of anything you want  the weight  the size  the cost  the functionality    I put a bunch of guys in my plane and I said   We're flying down to Walter Reed  and we're going talk to these kids  because frankly it doesn't matter whether we like this arm. It doesn't matter whether the Department of Defense likes this arm.  When I told them that they weren't entirely enthusiastic  but I told them   It really doesn't matter what their opinion is. There is only one opinion that matters  the kids that are either going to use it or not.  I told a bunch of my engineers   Look we're going to walk into Walter Reed  and you're going to see people  lots of them  missing major body parts. They're probably going to be angry  depressed  frustrated. We're probably going to have to give them support  encouragement. But we've got to extract from them enough information to make sure we're doing the right thing.  We walked into Walter Reed and I could not have been more wrong. We did see a bunch of people  a lot of them missing a lot of body parts  and parts they had left were burned  half a face gone  an ear burned off. They were sitting at a table. They were brought together for us. And we started asking them all questions.  Look   I'd say to them   We're not quite as good as nature yet. I could give you fine motor control  or I could let you curl    pounds  I probably can't do both. I can give you fast control with low reduction ratios in these gears  or I can give you power  I can't give you both. And we were trying to get them to all help us know what to give them. Not only were they enthusiastic  they kept thinking they're there to help us.  Well  would it help if I ...   Guys  and woman  you've given enough. We're here to help you. We need data. We need to know what you need.  After a half an hour  maybe  there was one guy at the far end of the table who wasn't saying much. You could see he was missing an arm. He was leaning on his other arm. I called down to the end   Hey  you haven't said much. If we needed this or this  what would you want   And he said   You know  I'm the lucky guy at this table. I lost my right arm  but I'm a lefty.  So  he wouldn't say much. He had a great spirit  like all the rest of them had great spirits. And he made a few comments. And then the meeting ended. We said goodbye to all these guys. And that guy pushed himself back from the table ... he has no legs. So  we left. And I was thinking   We didn't give them support and encouragement  they gave it to us. They're not finished giving yet.  It was astounding. So  we went back. And I started working harder  faster. Then we went out to Brooke Army Medical Center. And we saw lots of these kids  lots of them. And it was astounding how positive they are. So  we went back  and we've been working harder yet. We're in clinical trials  we've got five of them on people. We're screaming along. And I get a call and we go back to Washington. We go back to Walter Reed  and a kid  literally     some odd days before that was blown up. And they shipped him to Germany and    hours later they shipped him from Germany to Walter Reed. And he was there  and they said we needed to come. And I went down and they rolled him into a room. He's got no legs. He's got no arms. He's got a small residual limb on one side. Half of his face is gone  but they said his vision is coming back. He had one good eye. His name is Brandon Marrocco. And he said   I need your arms  but I need two of them.   You'll get them.  This kid was from Staten Island. And he said   I had a truck  before I went over there  and it had a stick. You think I'll be able to drive it    Sure.  And I turned around and went   How are we going to do this   Anyway  he was just like all the rest of them. He doesn't really want a lot. He wants to help. He told me that he wanted to go back to help his buddies. So  I was on my way out here. I was asked to stop at Texas. There were       people  the Veteran's Administration  U.S. ... just       at this huge event to help the families of all the kids    some that have died  some that are like Brandon    and they wanted me to speak. I said   What am I going to say  This is not a happy thing. Look  if this happens to you  I can give you ... This stuff is still not as good at the original equipment.   You need to come.  So  I went. And  as I think you get the point  there were a lot people there recovering. Some further along than others. But universally  these people that had been through this had astounding attitudes  and just the fact that people care makes a huge difference to them. I'll shut up  except one message or concern I have. I don't think anybody does it intentionally  but there were people there literally talking about   Well  how much will they get   You know  this country is involved as we've all heard  in this great healthcare debate.  Who is entitled to what  Who is entitled to how much  Who is going to pay for it   Those are tough questions. I don't have an answer to that. Not everybody can be entitled to everything simply because you were born here. It's not possible. It would be nice but let's be realistic. They were tough questions. There's polarized groups down there. I don't know the answers. There are other questions that are tough.  Should we be there  How do we get out  What do we need to do   There's very polarized answers to that question too  and I don't have any answers to that. Those are political questions  economic questions  strategic questions. I don't have the answer. But let me give you a simple concern or maybe statement  then. It is an easy answer. I know what these kids deserve on the healthcare side. I was talking to one of them  and he was really liking this arm    it's way  way  way better than a plastic stick with a hook on it    but there's nobody in this room that would rather have that than the one you got. But I was saying to him   You know  the first airplane went     feet in     . Wilbur and Orville. But you know what  It wouldn't have made an old pigeon jealous. But now we got Eagles out there  F  s  even that Bald Eagle. I've never seen a bird flying around at Mach  . I think eventually we'll make these things extraordinary.  And I said to that kid   I'll stop when your buddies are envious of your Luke arm because of what it can do  and how it does it. And we'll keep working. And I'm not going to stop working until we do that.  And I think this country ought to continue its great debate  whining and complaining   I'm entitled.   You're a victim.  And whining and complaining about what our foreign policy ought to be. But while we have the luxury of whining and complaining about who's paying for what and how much we get  the people that are out there giving us that great privilege of whining and complaining  I know what they deserve  everything humanly possible. And we ought to give it to them. So  the first robot to talk about is called STriDER. It stands for Self excited Tripedal Dynamic Experimental Robot. It's a robot that has three legs  which is inspired by nature. But have you seen anything in nature  an animal that has three legs  Probably not. So  why do I call this a biologically inspired robot  How would it work  But before that  let's look at pop culture. So  you know H.G. Wells'  War of the Worlds   novel and movie. And what you see over here is a very popular video game  and in this fiction they describe these alien creatures that are robots that have three legs that terrorize Earth. But my robot  STriDER  does not move like this. So  this is an actual dynamic simulation animation. I'm just going to show you how the robot works. It flips its body     degrees and it swings its leg between the two legs and catches the fall. So  that's how it walks. But when you look at us human being  bipedal walking  what you're doing is you're not really using a muscle to lift your leg and walk like a robot. Right  What you're doing is you really swing your leg and catch the fall  stand up again  swing your leg and catch the fall. You're using your built in dynamics  the physics of your body  just like a pendulum. We call that the concept of passive dynamic locomotion. What you're doing is  when you stand up  potential energy to kinetic energy  potential energy to kinetic energy. It's a constantly falling process. So  even though there is nothing in nature that looks like this  really  we were inspired by biology and applying the principles of walking to this robot. Thus it's a biologically inspired robot. What you see over here  this is what we want to do next. We want to fold up the legs and shoot it up for long range motion. And it deploys legs    it looks almost like  Star Wars     when it lands  it absorbs the shock and starts walking. What you see over here  this yellow thing  this is not a death ray.  Laughter  This is just to show you that if you have cameras or different types of sensors    because it is tall  it's  .  meters tall    you can see over obstacles like bushes and those kinds of things. So we have two prototypes. The first version  in the back  that's STriDER I. The one in front  the smaller  is STriDER II. The problem that we had with STriDER I is it was just too heavy in the body. We had so many motors  you know  aligning the joints  and those kinds of things. So  we decided to synthesize a mechanical mechanism so we could get rid of all the motors  and with a single motor we can coordinate all the motions. It's a mechanical solution to a problem  instead of using mechatronics. So  with this now the top body is light enough. So  it's walking in our lab  this was the very first successful step. It's still not perfected    its coffee falls down    so we still have a lot of work to do. The second robot I want to talk about is called IMPASS. It stands for Intelligent Mobility Platform with Actuated Spoke System. So  it's a wheel leg hybrid robot. So  think of a rimless wheel or a spoke wheel  but the spokes individually move in and out of the hub  so  it's a wheel leg hybrid. We are literally re inventing the wheel here. Let me demonstrate how it works. So  in this video we're using an approach called the reactive approach. Just simply using the tactile sensors on the feet  it's trying to walk over a changing terrain  a soft terrain where it pushes down and changes. And just by the tactile information  it successfully crosses over these type of terrain. But  when it encounters a very extreme terrain  in this case  this obstacle is more than three times the height of the robot  Then it switches to a deliberate mode  where it uses a laser range finder  and camera systems  to identify the obstacle and the size  and it plans  carefully plans the motion of the spokes and coordinates it so that it can show this kind of very very impressive mobility. You probably haven't seen anything like this out there. This is a very high mobility robot that we developed called IMPASS. Ah  isn't that cool  When you drive your car  when you steer your car  you use a method called Ackermann steering. The front wheels rotate like this. For most small wheeled robots  they use a method called differential steering where the left and right wheel turns the opposite direction. For IMPASS  we can do many  many different types of motion. For example  in this case  even though the left and right wheel is connected with a single axle rotating at the same angle of velocity. We just simply change the length of the spoke. It affects the diameter and then can turn to the left  turn to the right. So  these are just some examples of the neat things that we can do with IMPASS. This robot is called CLIMBeR  Cable suspended Limbed Intelligent Matching Behavior Robot. So  I've been talking to a lot of NASA JPL scientists    at JPL they are famous for the Mars rovers    and the scientists  geologists always tell me that the real interesting science  the science rich sites  are always at the cliffs. But the current rovers cannot get there. So  inspired by that we wanted to build a robot that can climb a structured cliff environment. So  this is CLIMBeR. So  what it does  it has three legs. It's probably difficult to see  but it has a winch and a cable at the top    and it tries to figure out the best place to put its foot. And then once it figures that out in real time  it calculates the force distribution  how much force it needs to exert to the surface so it doesn't tip and doesn't slip. Once it stabilizes that  it lifts a foot  and then with the winch it can climb up these kinds of thing. Also for search and rescue applications as well. Five years ago I actually worked at NASA JPL during the summer as a faculty fellow. And they already had a six legged robot called LEMUR. So  this is actually based on that. This robot is called MARS  Multi Appendage Robotic System. So  it's a hexapod robot. We developed our adaptive gait planner. We actually have a very interesting payload on there. The students like to have fun. And here you can see that it's walking over unstructured terrain. It's trying to walk on the coarse terrain  sandy area  but depending on the moisture content or the grain size of the sand the foot's soil sinkage model changes. So  it tries to adapt its gait to successfully cross over these kind of things. And also  it does some fun stuff  as can imagine. We get so many visitors visiting our lab. So  when the visitors come  MARS walks up to the computer  starts typing  Hello  my name is MARS.  Welcome to RoMeLa  the Robotics Mechanisms Laboratory at Virginia Tech. This robot is an amoeba robot. Now  we don't have enough time to go into technical details  I'll just show you some of the experiments. So  this is some of the early feasibility experiments. We store potential energy to the elastic skin to make it move. Or use an active tension cords to make it move forward and backward. It's called ChIMERA. We also have been working with some scientists and engineers from UPenn to come up with a chemically actuated version of this amoeba robot. We do something to something And just like magic  it moves. The blob. This robot is a very recent project. It's called RAPHaEL. Robotic Air Powered Hand with Elastic Ligaments. There are a lot of really neat  very good robotic hands out there in the market. The problem is they're just too expensive  tens of thousands of dollars. So  for prosthesis applications it's probably not too practical  because it's not affordable. We wanted to go tackle this problem in a very different direction. Instead of using electrical motors  electromechanical actuators  we're using compressed air. We developed these novel actuators for joints. It is compliant. You can actually change the force  simply just changing the air pressure. And it can actually crush an empty soda can. It can pick up very delicate objects like a raw egg  or in this case  a lightbulb. The best part  it took only      dollars to make the first prototype. This robot is actually a family of snake robots that we call HyDRAS  Hyper Degrees of freedom Robotic Articulated Serpentine. This is a robot that can climb structures. This is a HyDRAS's arm. It's a    degrees of freedom robotic arm. But the cool part is the user interface. The cable over there  that's an optical fiber. And this student  probably the first time using it  but she can articulate it many different ways. So  for example in Iraq  you know  the war zone  there is roadside bombs. Currently you send these remotely controlled vehicles that are armed. It takes really a lot of time and it's expensive to train the operator to operate this complex arm. In this case it's very intuitive  this student  probably his first time using it  doing very complex manipulation tasks  picking up objects and doing manipulation  just like that. Very intuitive. Now  this robot is currently our star robot. We actually have a fan club for the robot  DARwIn  Dynamic Anthropomorphic Robot with Intelligence. As you know  we are very interested in humanoid robot  human walking  so we decided to build a small humanoid robot. This was in       at that time  this was something really  really revolutionary. This was more of a feasibility study  What kind of motors should we use  Is it even possible  What kinds of controls should we do  So  this does not have any sensors. So  it's an open loop control. For those who probably know  if you don't have any sensors and there are any disturbances  you know what happens. So  based on that success  the following year we did the proper mechanical design starting from kinematics. And thus  DARwIn I was born in     . It stands up  it walks    very impressive. However  still  as you can see  it has a cord  umbilical cord. So  we're still using an external power source and external computation. So  in       now it's really time to have fun. Let's give it intelligence. We give it all the computing power it needs  a  .  gigahertz Pentium M chip  two FireWire cameras  rate gyros  accelerometers  four force sensors on the foot  lithium polymer batteries. And now DARwIn II is completely autonomous. It is not remote controlled. There are no tethers. It looks around  searches for the ball  looks around  searches for the ball  and it tries to play a game of soccer  autonomously  artificial intelligence. Let's see how it does. This was our very first trial  and... Spectators  Video   Goal  Dennis Hong  So  there is actually a competition called RoboCup. I don't know how many of you have heard about RoboCup. It's an international autonomous robot soccer competition. And the goal of RoboCup  the actual goal is  by the year      we want to have full size  autonomous humanoid robots play soccer against the human World Cup champions and win. It's a true actual goal. It's a very ambitious goal  but we truly believe that we can do it. So  this is last year in China. We were the very first team in the United States that qualified in the humanoid RoboCup competition. This is this year in Austria. You're going to see the action  three against three  completely autonomous. There you go. Yes  The robots track and they team play amongst themselves. It's very impressive. It's really a research event packaged in a more exciting competition event. What you see over here  this is the beautiful Louis Vuitton Cup trophy. So  this is for the best humanoid  and we would like to bring this for the very first time  to the United States next year  so wish us luck. Thank you. DARwIn also has a lot of other talents. Last year it actually conducted the Roanoke Symphony Orchestra for the holiday concert. This is the next generation robot  DARwIn IV  but smarter  faster  stronger. And it's trying to show off its ability   I'm macho  I'm strong. I can also do some Jackie Chan motion  martial art movements.  And it walks away. So  this is DARwIn IV. And again  you'll be able to see it in the lobby. We truly believe this is going to be the very first running humanoid robot in the United States. So  stay tuned. All right. So I showed you some of our exciting robots at work. So  what is the secret of our success  Where do we come up with these ideas  How do we develop these kinds of ideas  We have a fully autonomous vehicle that can drive into urban environments. We won a half a million dollars in the DARPA Urban Challenge. We also have the world's very first vehicle that can be driven by the blind. We call it the Blind Driver Challenge  very exciting. And many  many other robotics projects I want to talk about. These are just the awards that we won in      fall from robotics competitions and those kinds of things. So  really  we have five secrets. First is  Where do we get inspiration  Where do we get this spark of imagination  This is a true story  my personal story. At night when I go to bed        a.m. in the morning  I lie down  close my eyes  and I see these lines and circles and different shapes floating around. And they assemble  and they form these kinds of mechanisms. And then I think   Ah this is cool.  So  right next to my bed I keep a notebook  a journal  with a special pen that has a light on it  LED light  because I don't want to turn on the light and wake up my wife. So  I see this  scribble everything down  draw things  and I go to bed. Every day in the morning  the first thing I do before my first cup of coffee  before I brush my teeth  I open my notebook. Many times it's empty  sometimes I have something there    if something's there  sometimes it's junk    but most of the time I can't even read my handwriting. And so    am in the morning  what do you expect  right  So  I need to decipher what I wrote. But sometimes I see this ingenious idea in there  and I have this eureka moment. I directly run to my home office  sit at my computer  I type in the ideas  I sketch things out and I keep a database of ideas. So  when we have these calls for proposals  I try to find a match between my potential ideas and the problem. If there is a match we write a research proposal  get the research funding in  and that's how we start our research programs. But just a spark of imagination is not good enough. How do we develop these kinds of ideas  At our lab RoMeLa  the Robotics and Mechanisms Laboratory  we have these fantastic brainstorming sessions. So  we gather around  we discuss about problems and social problems and talk about it. But before we start we set this golden rule. The rule is  Nobody criticizes anybody's ideas. Nobody criticizes any opinion. This is important  because many times students  they fear or they feel uncomfortable how others might think about their opinions and thoughts. So  once you do this  it is amazing how the students open up. They have these wacky  cool  crazy  brilliant ideas  and the whole room is just electrified with creative energy. And this is how we develop our ideas. Well  we're running out of time. One more thing I want to talk about is  you know  just a spark of idea and development is not good enough. There was a great TED moment  I think it was Sir Ken Robinson  was it  He gave a talk about how education and school kills creativity. Well  actually  there are two sides to the story. So  there is only so much one can do with just ingenious ideas and creativity and good engineering intuition. If you want to go beyond a tinkering  if you want to go beyond a hobby of robotics and really tackle the grand challenges of robotics through rigorous research we need more than that. This is where school comes in. Batman  fighting against bad guys  he has his utility belt  he has his grappling hook  he has all different kinds of gadgets. For us roboticists  engineers and scientists  these tools  these are the courses and classes you take in class. Math  differential equations. I have linear algebra  science  physics  even nowadays  chemistry and biology  as you've seen. These are all the tools that we need. So  the more tools you have  for Batman  more effective at fighting the bad guys  for us  more tools to attack these kinds of big problems. So  education is very important. Also  it's not about that  only about that. You also have to work really  really hard. So  I always tell my students   Work smart  then work hard.  This picture in the back this is   a.m. in the morning. I guarantee if you come to your lab at       am we have students working there  not because I tell them to  but because we are having too much fun. Which leads to the last topic  Do not forget to have fun. That's really the secret of our success  we're having too much fun. I truly believe that highest productivity comes when you're having fun  and that's what we're doing. There you go. Thank you so much. Thank you. I have two missions here today. The first is to tell you something about pollen  I hope  and to convince you that it's more than just something that gets up your nose. And  secondly  to convince you that every home really ought to have a scanning electron microscope. Pollen is a flower's way of making more flowers. It carries male sex cells from one flower to another. This gives us genetic diversity  or at least it gives the plants genetic diversity. And it's really rather better not to mate with yourself. That's probably true of humans as well  mostly. Pollen is produced by the anthers of flowers. Each anther can carry up to         grains of pollen  so  it's quite prolific stuff. And it isn't just bright flowers that have pollen  it's also trees and grasses. And remember that all our cereal crops are grasses as well. Here is a scanning electron micrograph of a grain of pollen. The little hole in the middle  we'll come to a bit later  but that's for the pollen tube to come out later on. A very tiny tube. So  that's    micrometers across  that pollen grain there. That's about a   th of a millimeter. But not all pollen is quite so simple looking. This is Morina. This is a plant    which I've always thought to be rather tedious    named after Morin  who was an enterprising French gardener  who issued the first seed catalog in     . But anyway  take a look at its pollen. This is amazing  I think. That little hole in the middle there is for the pollen tube  and when the pollen finds its special female spot in another Morina flower  just on the right species  what happens  Like I said  pollen carries the male sex cells. If you actually didn't realize that plants have sex  they have rampant  promiscuous and really quite interesting and curious sex. Really. My story is actually not about plant propagation  but about pollen itself.  So  what are pollen's properties   I hear you ask. First of all  pollen is tiny. Yes we know that. It's also very biologically active  as anyone with hay fever will understand. Now  pollen from plants  which are wind dispersed    like trees and grasses and so on    tend to cause the most hay fever. And the reason for that is they've got to chuck out masses and masses of pollen to have any chance of the pollen reaching another plant of the same species. Here are some examples    they're very smooth if you look at them    of tree pollen that is meant to be carried by the wind. Again    this time  sycamore    wind dispersed. So  trees  very boring flowers  not really trying to attract insects. Cool pollen  though. This one I particularly like. This is the Monterey Pine  which has little air sacks to make the pollen carry even further. Remember  that thing is just about    micrometers across. Now  it's much more efficient if you can get insects to do your bidding. This is a bee's leg with the pollen glommed onto it from a mallow plant. And this is the outrageous and beautiful flower of the mangrove palm. Very showy  to attract lots of insects to do its bidding. The pollen has little barbs on it  if we look. Now  those little barbs obviously stick to the insects well  but there is something else that we can tell from this photograph  and that is that you might be able to see a fracture line across what would be the equator of this  if it was the Earth. That tells me that it's actually been fossilized  this pollen. And I'm rather proud to say that this was found just near London  and that    million years ago London was full of mangroves. Isn't that cool  Okay  so this is another species evolved to be dispersed by insects. You can tell that from the little barbs on there. All these pictures were taken with a scanning electron microscope  actually in the lab at Kew Laboratories. No coincidence that these were taken by Rob Kesseler  who is an artist  and I think it's someone with a design and artistic eye like him that has managed to bring out the best in pollen. Now  all this diversity means that you can look at a pollen grain and tell what species it came from  and that's actually quite handy if you maybe have a sample and you want to see where it came from. So  different species of plants grow in different places  and some pollen carries further than others. So  if you have a pollen sample  then in principle  you should be able to tell where that sample came from. And this is where it gets interesting for forensics. Pollen is tiny. It gets on to things  and it sticks to them. So  not only does each type of pollen look different  but each habitat has a different combination of plants. A different pollen signature  if you like  or a different pollen fingerprint. By looking at the proportions and combinations of different kinds of pollen in a sample  you can tell very precisely where it came from. This is some pollen embedded in a cotton shirt  similar to the one that I'm wearing now. Now  much of the pollen will still be there after repeated washings. Where has it been  Four very different habitats might look similar  but they've got very different pollen signatures. Actually this one is particularly easy  these pictures were all taken in different countries. But pollen forensics can be very subtle. It's being used now to track where counterfeit drugs have been made  where banknotes have come from  to look at the provenance of antiques and see that they really did come from the place the seller said they did. And murder suspects have been tracked using their clothing  certainly in the U.K.  to within an area that's small enough that you can send in tracker dogs to find the murder victim. So  you can tell from a piece of clothing to within about a kilometer or so  where that piece of clothing has been recently and then send in dogs. And finally  in a rather grizzly way  the Bosnia war crimes  some of the people brought to trial were brought to trial because of the evidence from pollen  which showed that bodies had been buried  exhumed and then reburied somewhere else. I hope I've opened your eyes  if you'll excuse the visual pun   Laughter  to some of pollen's secrets. This is a horse chestnut. There is an invisible beauty all around us  each grain with a story to tell ... each of us  in fact  with a story to tell from the pollen fingerprint that's upon us. Thank you to the colleagues at Kew  and thank you to palynologists everywhere.   My age is three hundred     and seventy two     I think with the deepest regret     How I used to pick up and voraciously chew     the dear little boys that I met     I've eaten them raw in their holiday suits      Eaten them curried with rice      I've eaten them baked in their jackets and boots      And found them exceedingly nice.     But now that my jaws are too weak for such fare      I think it's increasingly rude     To do such a thing when I'm quite well aware     Little boys do not like being chewed.     Little boys do not like being chewed.     So now I contentedly live upon eels      And try to do nothing amiss     And pass all the time I can spare from my meals     In innocent slumber like this      Innocent slumber like this.   I suppose I owe you an explanation. I've been working on a project for the last six years adapting children's poetry to music. And that's a poem by Charles Edward Carryl  who was a stockbroker in New York City for    years  but in the evenings  he wrote nonsense for his children. And this book was one of the most famous books in America for about    years.  The Sleepy Giant   which is the song that I just sang  is one of his poems. Now  we're going to do other poems for you  and here's a preview of some of the poets. This is Rachel Field  Robert Graves    a very young Robert Graves    Christina Rossetti. Ghosts  right  Have nothing to say to us  obsolete  gone    not so. What I really enjoyed about this project is reviving these people's words. Taking them off the dead  flat pages. Bringing them to life  bringing them to light. So  what we're going to do next is a poem that was written by Nathalia Crane. Nathalia Crane was a little girl from Brooklyn. When she was    years old in       she published her first book of poems called  The Janitor's Boy.  Here she is. And here's her poem.   Oh  I'm in love with the janitor's boy      And the janitor's boy is in love with me.     Oh  I'm in love with the janitor's boy      And the janitor's boy is in love with me.     He's going to hunt for a desert isle     In our geography.     A desert isle with spicy trees     Somewhere in Sheepshead Bay      A right nice place  just fit for two     Where we can live always.     Oh  I'm in love with the janitor's boy      And the janitor's boy    he's busy as can be      Down in the cellar he's making a raft     Out of an old settee.     He'll carry me off  I know that he will      For his hair is exceedingly red      And the only thing that occurs to me     Is to dutifully shiver in bed.     And on the day that we sail  I will leave a little note     For my parents I hate to annoy       I have flown to an island in the bay     With my janitor's red haired boy.      The janitor's red haired boy     The janitor's red haired boy     The janitor's red haired boy     The janitor's red haired boy     I'm going to sail away     Gone to Sheepshead Bay     With my janitor's red haired boy.     On an old settee     My red haired boy and me     The janitor's red haired boy.     The janitor's red haired boy     The janitor's red haired boy     The janitor's red haired boy     The janitor's red haired boy   The next poem is by E.E. Cummings   Maggie and Milly and Molly and May.    Maggie and Milly  Molly and May     They went down to the beach one day to play     And Maggie discovered a shell that sang     So sweetly she couldn't remember her troubles     Maggie and Milly  Molly and May     Maggie and Milly  Molly and May     Milly befriended a stranded star     Whose rays  whose rays     Five languid fingers were     Maggie and Milly  Molly and May     Maggie and Milly  Molly and May     Molly was chased by a horrible thing     Which raced sideways blowing     Blowing     Blowing     May came home with a smooth  round stone     Small as a world and as large as alone     For whatever we lose like a you or a me     Always ourselves that we find at the sea   Thank you. The next poem is  If No One Ever Marries Me.  It was written by Laurence Alma Tadema. She was the daughter of a very  very famous Dutch painter who had made his fame in England. He went there after the death of his wife of smallpox and brought his two young children. One was his daughter  Laurence. She wrote this poem when she was    years old in       and I look at it as kind of a very sweet feminist manifesto tinged with a little bit of defiance and a little bit of resignation and regret.   Well  if no one ever marries me     And I don't see why they should      Nurse says I'm not pretty      And you know I'm seldom good  seldom good        Well  if no one ever marries me     I shan't mind very much      Buy a squirrel in a cage     And a little rabbit hutch.     If no one marries me     If no one marries me     If no one marries me     If no one marries me     If no one marries me     I'll have a cottage near a wood     And a pony all my own     A little lamb quite clean and tame     That I can take to town.     And when I'm really getting old        And    or nine        Buy myself a little orphan girl     And bring her up as mine.     If no one marries me     If no one marries me     If no one marries me     If no one marries me     Well  if no one marries me     Marries me     Well  if no one marries me     Marries me     Well  if no one marries me   Thank you. I became very curious about the poets after spending six years with them  and started to research their lives  and then decided to write a book about it. And the burning question about Alma Tadema was  Did she marry  And the answer was no  which I found in the London Times archive. She died alone in      in the company of her books and her dear friends. Gerard Manley Hopkins  a saintly man. He became a Jesuit. He converted from his Anglican faith. He was moved to by the Tractarian Movement  the Oxford Movement  otherwise known as    and he became a Jesuit priest. He burned all his poetry at the age of    and then did not write another poem for at least seven years because he couldn't rectify the life of a poet with the life of a priest. He died typhoid fever at the age of     I believe     or   . At the time  he was teaching classics at Trinity College in Dublin. A few years before he died  after he had resumed writing poetry  but in secret  he confessed to a friend in a letter that I found when I was doing my research   I've written a verse. It is to explain death to a child  and it deserves a piece of plain song music.  And my blood froze when I read that because I had written the plain song music     years after he'd written the letter. And the poem is called   Spring and Fall.    Margaret  are you grieving     Over Goldengrove unleaving  by and by      Leaves  like the things of man  you     With your fresh thoughts care for  can you      But as the heart grows older     It will come to such sights much colder     By and by  nor spare a sigh     Though worlds of wanwood leafmeal lie      And yet you will weep and you'll know why.     No matter child  the name      Sorrow's springs are all the same     They're all the same.     Nor mouth had nor no mind expressed     What heart heard of  ghost had guessed      It's the blight man was born for      It is Margaret that you mourn for   Thank you so much. I'd like to thank everybody  all the scientists  the philosophers  the architects  the inventors  the biologists  the botanists  the artists ... everyone that blew my mind this week. Thank you.   Oh  a li la li la la la     La li la la li la la la la la la    Applause    La li la la la     La li la la la la     La li la la la la la la     La la la li la la la la la     You've been so kind and generous     I don't know how you keep on giving.

That's innovative  don't you think  Calming the audience down  I'm supposed to be whipping you into a frenzy  and I   That's enough. Sh.   Laughter    Now  you've been kind and ...   I'm going to sing this to Bill Gates.  Laughter  I have so much admiration for him.   Now  you've been so kind and generous      I don't know how you keep on giving.

Laughter   Clapping    I want to thank you  thank you     Thank you  thank you     Thank you  thank you     Thank you  thank you     I want to thank you  thank you   It works better  right    I want to thank you  thank you     I want to thank you     Ooh hoo     Ooh hoo     Ooh hoo     Ooh hoo   Let's bring it down. Decrescendo. Gradually  bringing it down  bringing it down.   I want to thank you  thank you   Finger popping  ain't no stopping. Thank you so much. Let's pretend right here we have a machine. A big machine  a cool  TED ish machine  and it's a time machine. And everyone in this room has to get into it. And you can go backwards  you can go forwards  you cannot stay where you are. And I wonder what you'd choose  because I've been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back. I don't know. They want to go back before there were automobiles or Twitter or  American Idol.  I don't know. I'm convinced that there's some sort of pull to nostalgia  to wishful thinking. And I understand that. I'm not part of that crowd  I have to say. I don't want to go back  and it's not because I'm adventurous. It's because possibilities on this planet  they don't go back  they go forward. So I want to get in the machine  and I want to go forward. This is the greatest time there's ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose  health  wealth  mobility  opportunity  declining rates of disease ... There's never been a time like this. My great grandparents died  all of them  by the time they were   . My grandparents pushed that number to   . My parents are closing in on   . So there better be a nine at the beginning of my death number. But it's not even about people like us  because this is a bigger deal than that. A kid born in New Delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did     years ago. Think about that  it's an incredible fact. And why is it true  Smallpox. Smallpox killed billions of people on this planet. It reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no war ever has. It's gone. It's vanished. We vanquished it. Puff. In the rich world  diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist  hardly. Diphtheria  rubella  polio ... does anyone even know what those things are  Vaccines  modern medicine  our ability to feed billions of people  those are triumphs of the scientific method. And to my mind  the scientific method    trying stuff out  seeing if it works  changing it when it doesn't    is one of the great accomplishments of humanity. So that's the good news. Unfortunately  that's all the good news because there are some other problems  and they've been mentioned many times. And one of them is that despite all our accomplishments  a billion people go to bed hungry in this world every day. That number's rising  and it's rising really rapidly  and it's disgraceful. And not only that  we've used our imagination to thoroughly trash this globe. Potable water  arable land  rainforests  oil  gas  they're going away  and they're going away soon  and unless we innovate our way out of this mess  we're going away too. So the question is  Can we do that  And I think we can. I think it's clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on. I think we can power this world with energy that doesn't also destroy it. I really do believe that  and  no  it ain't wishful thinking. But here's the thing that keeps me up at night    one of the things that keeps me up at night  We've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now. Never. And we've also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can today. We're on the verge of amazing  amazing events in many fields  and yet I actually think we'd have to go back hundreds      years  before the Enlightenment  to find a time when we battled progress  when we fought about these things more vigorously  on more fronts  than we do now. People wrap themselves in their beliefs  and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free. Not even the truth will set them free. And  listen  everyone's entitled to their opinion  they're even entitled to their opinion about progress. But you know what you're not entitled to  You're not entitled to your own facts. Sorry  you're not. And this took me awhile to figure out. About a decade ago  I wrote a story about vaccines for The New Yorker. A little story. And I was amazed to find opposition  opposition to what is  after all  the most effective public health measure in human history. I didn't know what to do  so I just did what I do  I wrote a story and I moved on. And soon after that  I wrote a story about genetically engineered food. Same thing  only bigger. People were going crazy. So I wrote a story about that too  and I couldn't understand why people thought this was  Frankenfoods   why they thought moving molecules around in a specific  rather than a haphazard way  was trespassing on nature's ground. But  you know  I do what I do. I wrote the story  I moved on. I mean  I'm a journalist. We type  we file  we go to dinner. It's fine. But these stories bothered me  and I couldn't figure out why  and eventually I did. And that's because those fanatics that were driving me crazy weren't actually fanatics at all. They were thoughtful people  educated people  decent people. They were exactly like the people in this room. And it just disturbed me so much. But then I thought  you know  let's be honest. We're at a point in this world where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to. We talk about it ambivalently. We talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it   progress.  Okay  there are reasons for that  and I think we know what those reasons are. We've lost faith in institutions  in authority  and sometimes in science itself  and there's no reason we shouldn't have. You can just say a few names and people will understand. Chernobyl  Bhopal  the Challenger  Vioxx  weapons of mass destruction  hanging chads. You know  you can choose your list. There are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right  so be skeptical. Ask questions  demand proof  demand evidence. Don't take anything for granted. But here's the thing  When you get proof  you need to accept the proof  and we're not that good at doing that. And the reason that I can say that is because we're now in an epidemic of fear like one I've never seen and hope never to see again. About    years ago  there was a story published  a horrible story  that linked the epidemic of autism to the measles  mumps and rubella vaccine shot. Very scary. Tons of studies were done to see if this was true. Tons of studies should have been done  it's a serious issue. The data came back. The data came back from the United States  from England  from Sweden  from Canada  and it was all the same  no correlation  no connection  none at all. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter because we believe anecdotes  we believe what we see  what we think we see  what makes us feel real. We don't believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data  and I do understand that  I think we all do. But you know what  The result of that has been disastrous. Disastrous because here's a fact  The United States is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for measles is going down. That is disgraceful  and we should be ashamed of ourselves. It's horrible. What kind of a thing happened that we could do that  Now  I understand it. I do understand it. Because  did anyone have measles here  Has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of measles  Doesn't happen very much. Doesn't happen in this country at all  but it happened         times in the world last year. That's a lot of death of measles       an hour. But since it didn't happen here  we can put it out of our minds  and people like Jenny McCarthy can go around preaching messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like  Oprah  and  Larry King Live.  And they can do it because they don't link causation and correlation. They don't understand that these things seem the same  but they're almost never the same. And it's something we need to learn  and we need to learn it really soon. This guy was a hero  Jonas Salk. He took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us. No fear  no agony. Polio    puff  gone. That guy in the middle  not so much. His name is Paul Offit. He just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people. It'll save the lives of     to         kids in the developing world every year. Pretty good  right  Well  it's good  except that Paul goes around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are and that people ought to just stop the whining. And he actually says it that way. So  Paul's a terrorist. When Paul speaks in a public hearing  he can't testify without armed guards. He gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school. And why  Because Paul made a vaccine. I don't need to say this  but vaccines are essential. You take them away  disease comes back  horrible diseases. And that's happening. We have measles in this country now. And it's getting worse  and pretty soon kids are going to die of it again because it's just a numbers game. And they're not just going to die of measles. What about polio  Let's have that. Why not  A college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought I was a little strident. No one's ever said that before. She wasn't going to vaccinate her kid against polio  no way. Fine. Why  Because we don't have polio. And you know what  We didn't have polio in this country yesterday. Today  I don't know  maybe a guy got on a plane in Lagos this morning  and he's flying to LAX  right now he's over Ohio. And he's going to land in a couple of hours  he's going to rent a car  and he's going to come to Long Beach  and he's going to attend one of these fabulous TED dinners tonight. And he doesn't know that he's infected with a paralytic disease  and we don't either because that's the way the world works. That's the planet we live on. Don't pretend it isn't. Now  we love to wrap ourselves in lies. We love to do it. Everyone take their vitamins this morning  Echinacea  a little antioxidant to get you going. I know you did because half of Americans do every day. They take the stuff  and they take alternative medicines  and it doesn't matter how often we find out that they're useless. The data says it all the time. They darken your urine. They almost never do more than that. It's okay  you want to pay    billion dollars for dark urine  I'm totally with you. Dark urine. Dark. Why do we do that  Why do we do that  Well  I think I understand  we hate Big Pharma. We hate Big Government. We don't trust the Man. And we shouldn't  Our health care system sucks. It's cruel to millions of people. It's absolutely astonishingly cold and soul bending to those of us who can even afford it. So we run away from it  and where do we run  We leap into the arms of Big Placebo. That's fantastic. I love Big Placebo. But  you know  it's really a serious thing because this stuff is crap  and we spend billions of dollars on it. And I have all sorts of little props here. None of it ... ginkgo  fraud  echinacea  fraud  acai    I don't even know what that is but we're spending billions of dollars on it    it's fraud. And you know what  When I say this stuff  people scream at me  and they say   What do you care  Let people do what they want to do. It makes them feel good.  And you know what  You're wrong. Because I don't care if it's the secretary of HHS who's saying   Hmm  I'm not going to take the evidence of my experts on mammograms   or some cancer quack who wants to treat his patient with coffee enemas. When you start down the road where belief and magic replace evidence and science  you end up in a place you don't want to be. You end up in Thabo Mbeki South Africa. He killed         of his people by insisting that beetroot  garlic and lemon oil were much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs we know can slow the course of AIDS. Hundreds of thousands of needless deaths in a country that has been plagued worse than any other by this disease. Please  don't tell me there are no consequences to these things. There are. There always are. Now  the most mindless epidemic we're in the middle of right now is this absurd battle between proponents of genetically engineered food and the organic elite. It's an idiotic debate. It has to stop. It's a debate about words  about metaphors. It's ideology  it's not science. Every single thing we eat  every grain of rice  every sprig of parsley  every Brussels sprout has been modified by man. You know  there weren't tangerines in the garden of Eden. There wasn't any cantaloupe.  Laughter  There weren't Christmas trees. We made it all. We made it over the last        years. And some of it worked  and some of it didn't. We got rid of the stuff that didn't. Now we can do it in a more precise way    and there are risks  absolutely    but we can put something like vitamin A into rice  and that stuff can help millions of people  millions of people  prolong their lives. You don't want to do that  I have to say  I don't understand it. We object to genetically engineered food. Why do we do that  Well  the things I constantly hear are  Too many chemicals  pesticides  hormones  monoculture  we don't want giant fields of the same thing  that's wrong. We don't companies patenting life. We don't want companies owning seeds. And you know what my response to all of that is  Yes  you're right. Let's fix it. It's true  we've got a huge food problem  but this isn't science. This has nothing to do with science. It's law  it's morality  it's patent stuff. You know science isn't a company. It's not a country. It's not even an idea  it's a process. It's a process  and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't  but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we're afraid  is really very deadening  and it's preventing millions of people from prospering. You know  in the next    years we're going to have to grow    percent more food than we do right now     percent. This investment in Africa over the last    years. Disgraceful. Disgraceful. They need it  and we're not giving it to them. And why  Genetically engineered food. We don't want to encourage people to eat that rotten stuff  like cassava for instance. Cassava's something that half a billion people eat. It's kind of like a potato. It's just a bunch of calories. It sucks. It doesn't have nutrients  it doesn't have protein  and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now. And then people would be able to eat it and they'd be able to not go blind. They wouldn't starve  and you know what  That would be nice. It wouldn't be Chez Panisse  but it would be nice. And all I can say about this is  Why are we fighting it  I mean  let's ask ourselves  Why are we fighting it  Because we don't want to move genes around  This is about moving genes around. It's not about chemicals. It's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones  our insistence on having bigger food  better food  singular food. This isn't about Rice Krispies  this is about keeping people alive  and it's about time we started to understand what that meant. Because  you know something  If we don't  if we continue to act the way we're acting  we're guilty of something that I don't think we want to be guilty of  high tech colonialism. There's no other way to describe what's going on here. It's selfish  it's ugly  it's beneath us  and we really have to stop it. So after this amazingly fun conversation  you might want to say   So  you still want to get in this ridiculous time machine and go forward   Absolutely. Absolutely  I do. It's stuck in the present right now  but we have an amazing opportunity. We can set that time machine on anything we want. We can move it where we want to move it  and we're going to move it where we want to move it. We have to have these conversations and we have to think  but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead  we're going to be happy we do. I know that we can  and as far as I'm concerned  that's something the world needs right now. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. In my industry  we believe that images can change the world. Okay  we're naive  we're bright eyed and bushy tailed. The truth is that we know that the images themselves don't change the world  but we're also aware that  since the beginning of photography  images have provoked reactions in people  and those reactions have caused change to happen. So let's begin with a group of images. I'd be extremely surprised if you didn't recognize many or most of them. They're best described as iconic  so iconic  perhaps  they're cliches. In fact  they're so well known that you might even recognize them in a slightly or somewhat different form. But I think we're looking for something more. We're looking for something more. We're looking for images that shine an uncompromising light on crucial issues  images that transcend borders  that transcend religions  images that provoke us to step up and do something    in other words  to act. Well  this image you've all seen. It changed our view of the physical world. We had never seen our planet from this perspective before. Many people credit a lot of the birth of the environmental movement to our seeing the planet like this for the first time    its smallness  its fragility. Forty years later  this group  more than most  are well aware of the destructive power that our species can wield over our environment. And at last  we appear to be doing something about it. This destructive power takes many different forms. For example  these images taken by Brent Stirton in the Congo. These gorillas were murdered  some would even say crucified  and unsurprisingly  they sparked international outrage. Most recently  we've been tragically reminded of the destructive power of nature itself with the recent earthquake in Haiti. Well  I think what is far worse is man's destructive power over man. Samuel Pisar  an Auschwitz survivor  said  and I'll quote him   The Holocaust teaches us that nature  even in its cruelest moments  is benign in comparison with man  when he loses his moral compass and his reason.  There's another kind of crucifixion. The horrifying images from Abu Ghraib as well as the images from Guantanamo had a profound impact. The publication of those images  as opposed to the images themselves  caused a government to change its policies. Some would argue that it is those images that did more to fuel the insurgency in Iraq than virtually any other single act. Furthermore  those images forever removed the so called moral high ground of the occupying forces. Let's go back a little. In the     s and     s  the Vietnam War was basically shown in America's living rooms day in  day out. News photos brought people face to face with the victims of the war  a little girl burned by napalm  a student killed by the National Guard at Kent State University in Ohio during a protest. In fact  these images became the voices of protest themselves. Now  images have power to shed light of understanding on suspicion  ignorance  and in particular    I've given a lot of talks on this but I'll just show one image    the issue of HIV AIDS. In the     s  the stigmatization of people with the disease was an enormous barrier to even discussing or addressing it. A simple act  in       of the most famous woman in the world  the Princess of Wales  touching an HIV AIDS infected baby did a great deal  especially in Europe  to stop that. She  better than most  knew the power of an image. So when we are confronted by a powerful image  we all have a choice  We can look away  or we can address the image. Thankfully  when these photos appeared in The Guardian in       they put a lot of focus and attention and  in the end  a lot of money towards the Sudan famine relief efforts. Did the images change the world  No  but they had a major impact. Images often push us to question our core beliefs and our responsibilities to each other. We all saw those images after Katrina  and I think for millions of people they had a very strong impact. And I think it's very unlikely that they were far from the minds of Americans when they went to vote in November     . Unfortunately  some very important images are deemed too graphic or disturbing for us to see them. I'll show you one photo here  and it's a photo by Eugene Richards of an Iraq War veteran from an extraordinary piece of work  which has never been published  called War Is Personal. But images don't need to be graphic in order to remind us of the tragedy of war. John Moore set up this photo at Arlington Cemetery. After all the tense moments of conflict in all the conflict zones of the world  there's one photograph from a much quieter place that haunts me still  much more than the others. Ansel Adams said  and I'm going to disagree with him   You don't take a photograph  you make it.  In my view  it's not the photographer who makes the photo  it's you. We bring to each image our own values  our own belief systems  and as a result of that  the image resonates with us. My company has    million images. I have one image in my office. Here it is. I hope that the next time you see an image that sparks something in you  you'll better understand why  and I know that speaking to this audience  you'll definitely do something about it. And thank you to all the photographers. First of all  I'm a geek. I'm an organic food eating  carbon footprint minimizing  robotic surgery geek. And I really want to build green  but I'm very suspicious of all of these well meaning articles  people long on moral authority and short on data  telling me how to do these kinds of things. And so I have to figure this out for myself. For example  Is this evil  I have dropped a blob of organic yogurt from happy self actualized local cows on my counter top  and I grab a paper towel and I want to wipe it up. But can I use a paper towel   Laughter  The answer to this can be found in embodied energy. This is the amount of energy that goes into any paper towel or embodied water  and every time I use a paper towel  I am using this much virtual energy and water. Wipe it up  throw it away. Now  if I compare that to a cotton towel that I can use a thousand times  I don't have a whole lot of embodied energy until I wash that yogurty towel. This is now operating energy. So if I throw my towel in the washing machine  I've now put energy and water back into that towel ... unless I use a front loading  high efficiency washing machine   Laughter  and then it looks a little bit better. But what about a recycled paper towel that comes in those little half sheets  Well  now a paper towel looks better. Screw the paper towels. Let's go to a sponge. I wipe it up with a sponge  and I put it under the running water  and I have a lot less energy and a lot more water. Unless you're like me and you leave the handle in the position of hot even when you turn it on  and then you start to use more energy. Or worse  you let it run until it's warm to rinse out your towel. And now all bets are off. So what this says is that sometimes the things that you least expect    the position in which you put the handle    have a bigger effect than any of those other things that you were trying to optimize. Now imagine someone as twisted as me trying to build a house. That's what my husband and I are doing right now. And so  we wanted to know  how green could we be  And there's a thousand and one articles out there telling us how to make all these green trade offs. And they are just as suspect in telling us to optimize these little things around the edges and missing the elephant in the living room. Now  the average house has about     megawatt hours of embodied energy in it  this is the energy it takes to make it    millions and millions of paper towels. We wanted to know how much better we could do. And so  like many people  we start with a house on a lot  and I'm going to show you a typical construction on the top and what we're doing on the bottom. So first  we demolish it. It takes some energy  but if you deconstruct it    you take it all apart  you use the bits    you can get some of that energy back. We then dug a big hole to put in a rainwater catchment tank to take our yard water independent. And then we poured a big foundation for passive solar. Now  you can reduce the embodied energy by about    percent by using high fly ash concrete. We then put in framing. And so this is framing    lumber  composite materials    and it's kind of hard to get the embodied energy out of that  but it can be a sustainable resource if you use FSC certified lumber. We then go on to the first thing that was very surprising. If we put aluminum windows in this house  we would double the energy use right there. Now  PVC is a little bit better  but still not as good as the wood that we chose. We then put in plumbing  electrical and HVAC  and insulate. Now  spray foam is an excellent insulator    it fills in all the cracks    but it is pretty high embodied energy  and  sprayed in cellulose or blue jeans is a much lower energy alternative to that. We also used straw bale infill for our library  which has zero embodied energy. When it comes time to sheetrock  if you use EcoRock it's about a quarter of the embodied energy of standard sheetrock. And then you get to the finishes  the subject of all of those  go green  articles  and on the scale of a house they almost make no difference at all. And yet  all the press is focused on that. Except for flooring. If you put carpeting in your house  it's about a tenth of the embodied energy of the entire house  unless you use concrete or wood for a much lower embodied energy. So now we add in the final construction energy  we add it all up  and we've built a house for less than half of the typical embodied energy for building a house like this. But before we pat ourselves too much on the back  we have poured     megawatt hours of energy into constructing this house when there was a house there before. And so the question is  How could we make that back  And so if I run my new energy efficient house forward  compared with the old  non energy efficient house  we make it back in about six years. Now  I probably would have upgraded the old house to be more energy efficient  and in that case  it would take me more about    years to break even. Now  if I hadn't paid attention to embodied energy  it would have taken us over    years to break even compared to the upgraded house. So what does this mean  On the scale of my portion of the house  this is equivalent to about as much as I drive in a year  it's about five times as much as if I went entirely vegetarian. But my elephant in the living room flies. Clearly  I need to walk home from TED. But all the calculations for embodied energy are on the blog. And  remember  it's sometimes the things that you are not expecting to be the biggest changes that are. Thank you.  Applause  The brilliant playwright  Adrienne Kennedy  wrote a volume called  People Who Led to My Plays.  And if I were to write a volume  it would be called   Artists Who Have Led My Exhibitions  because my work  in understanding art and in understanding culture  has come by following artists  by looking at what artists mean and what they do and who they are. J.J. from  Good Times   significant to many people of course because of  Dy no mite   but perhaps more significant as the first  really  black artist on primetime TV. Jean Michel Basquiat  important to me because  he was  the first black artist in real time that showed me the possibility of who and what I was about to enter into. My overall project is about art    specifically  about black artists    very generally about the way in which art can change the way we think about culture and ourselves. My interest is in artists who understand and rewrite history  who think about themselves within the narrative of the larger world of art  but who have created new places for us to see and understand. I'm showing two artists here   Glenn Ligon and Kara Walker  two of many who really form for me the essential questions that I wanted to bring as a curator to the world. I was interested in the idea of why and how I could create a new story  a new narrative in art history and a new narrative in the world. And to do this  I knew that I had to see the way in which artists work  understand the artist's studio as a laboratory  imagine  then  reinventing the museum as a think tank and looking at the exhibition as the ultimate white paper    asking questions  providing the space to look and to think about answers. In       when I was a curator at the Whitney Museum  I made an exhibition called Black Male. It looked at the intersection of race and gender in contemporary American art. It sought to express the ways in which art could provide a space for dialogue    complicated dialogue  dialogue with many  many points of entry    and how the museum could be the space for this contest of ideas. This exhibition included over    artists of various ages and races  but all looking at black masculinity from a very particular point of view. What was significant about this exhibition is the way in which it engaged me in my role as a curator  as a catalyst  for this dialogue. One of the things that happened very distinctly in the course of this exhibition is I was confronted with the idea of how powerful images can be in people's understanding  of themselves and each other. I'm showing you two works  one on the right by Leon Golub  one on the left by Robert Colescott. And in the course of the exhibition    which was contentious  controversial and ultimately  for me  life changing in my sense of what art could be    a woman came up to me on the gallery floor to express her concern about the nature of how powerful images could be and how we understood each other. And she pointed to the work on the left to tell me how problematic this image was  as it related  for her  to the idea of how black people had been represented. And she pointed to the image on the right as an example  to me  of the kind of dignity that needed to be portrayed to work against those images in the media. She then assigned these works racial identities  basically saying to me that the work on the right  clearly  was made by a black artist  the work on the left  clearly  by a white artist  when  in effect  that was the opposite case  Bob Colescott  African American artist  Leon Golub  a white artist. The point of that for me was to say    in that space  in that moment    that I really  more than anything  wanted to understand how images could work  how images did work  and how artists provided a space bigger than one that we could imagine in our day to day lives to work through these images. Fast forward and I end up in Harlem  home for many of black America  very much the psychic heart of the black experience  really the place where the Harlem Renaissance existed. Harlem now  sort of explaining and thinking of itself in this part of the century  looking both backwards and forwards ... I always say Harlem is an interesting community because  unlike many other places  it thinks of itself in the past  present and the future simultaneously  no one speaks of it just in the now. It's always what it was and what it can be. And  in thinking about that  then my second project  the second question I ask is  Can a museum be a catalyst in a community  Can a museum house artists and allow them to be change agents as communities rethink themselves  This is Harlem  actually  on January   th  thinking about itself in a very wonderful way. So I work now at The Studio Museum in Harlem  thinking about exhibitions there  thinking about what it means to discover art's possibility. Now  what does this mean to some of you  In some cases  I know that many of you are involved in cross cultural dialogues  you're involved in ideas of creativity and innovation. Think about the place that artists can play in that    that is the kind of incubation and advocacy that I work towards  in working with young  black artists. Think about artists  not as content providers  though they can be brilliant at that  but  again  as real catalysts. The Studio Museum was founded in the late   s. And I bring this up because it's important to locate this practice in history. To look at       in the incredible historic moment that it is  and think of the arc that has happened since then  to think of the possibilities that we are all privileged to stand in today and imagine that this museum that came out of a moment of great protest and one that was so much about examining the history and the legacy of important African American artists to the history of art in this country like Jacob Lawrence  Norman Lewis  Romare Bearden. And then  of course  to bring us to today. In       Muhammad Ali gave a lecture at Harvard University. After his lecture  a student got up and said to him   Give us a poem.  And Mohammed Ali said   Me  we.  A profound statement about the individual and the community. The space in which now  in my project of discovery  of thinking about artists  of trying to define what might be black art cultural movement of the   st century. What that might mean for cultural movements all over this moment  the  me  we  seems incredibly prescient totally important. To this end  the specific project that has made this possible for me is a series of exhibitions  all titled with an F    Freestyle  Frequency and Flow    which have set out to discover and define the young  black artists working in this moment who I feel strongly will continue to work over the next many years. This series of exhibitions was made specifically to try and question the idea of what it would mean now  at this point in history  to see art as a catalyst  what it means now  at this point in history  as we define and redefine culture  black culture specifically in my case  but culture generally. I named this group of artists around an idea  which I put out there called post black  really meant to define them as artists who came and start their work now  looking back at history but start in this moment  historically. It is really in this sense of discovery that I have a new set of questions that I'm asking. This new set of questions is  What does it mean  right now  to be African American in America  What can artwork say about this  Where can a museum exist as the place for us all to have this conversation  Really  most exciting about this is thinking about the energy and the excitement that young artists can bring. Their works for me are about  not always just simply about the aesthetic innovation that their minds imagine  that their visions create and put out there in the world  but more  perhaps  importantly  through the excitement of the community that they create as important voices that would allow us right now to understand our situation  as well as in the future. I am continually amazed by the way in which the subject of race can take itself in many places that we don't imagine it should be. I am always amazed by the way in which artists are willing to do that in their work. It is why I look to art. It's why I ask questions of art. It is why I make exhibitions. Now  this exhibition  as I said     young artists done over the course of eight years  and for me it's about considering the implications. It's considering the implications of what this generation has to say to the rest of us. It's considering what it means for these artists to be both out in the world as their work travels  but in their communities as people who are seeing and thinking about the issues that face us. It's also about thinking about the creative spirit and nurturing it  and imagining  particularly in urban America  about the nurturing of the spirit. Now  where  perhaps  does this end up right now  For me  it is about re imagining this cultural discourse in an international context. So the last iteration of this project has been called Flow  with the idea now of creating a real network of artists around the world  really looking  not so much from Harlem and out  but looking across  and Flow looked at artists all born on the continent of Africa. And as many of us think about that continent and think about what if means to us all in the   st century  I have begun that looking through artists  through artworks  and imagining what they can tell us about the future  what they tell us about our future  and what they create in their sense of offering us this great possibility of watching that continent emerge as part of our bigger dialogue. So  what do I discover when I look at artworks  What do I think about when I think about art  I feel like the privilege I've had as a curator is not just the discovery of new works  the discovery of exciting works. But  really  it has been what I've discovered about myself and what I can offer in the space of an exhibition  to talk about beauty  to talk about power  to talk about ourselves  and to talk and speak to each other. That's what makes me get up every day and want to think about this generation of black artists and artists around the world. Thank you.  Applause  In the spirit of Jacques Cousteau  who said   People protect what they love   I want to share with you today what I love most in the ocean  and that's the incredible number and variety of animals in it that make light. My addiction began with this strange looking diving suit called Wasp  that's not an acronym    just somebody thought it looked like the insect. It was actually developed for use by the offshore oil industry for diving on oil rigs down to a depth of       feet. Right after I completed my Ph.D.  I was lucky enough to be included with a group of scientists that was using it for the first time as a tool for ocean exploration. We trained in a tank in Port Hueneme  and then my first open ocean dive was in Santa Barbara Channel. It was an evening dive. I went down to a depth of     feet and turned out the lights. And the reason I turned out the lights is because I knew I would see this phenomenon of animals making light called bioluminescence. But I was totally unprepared for how much there was and how spectacular it was. I saw chains of jellyfish called siphonophores that were longer than this room  pumping out so much light that I could read the dials and gauges inside the suit without a flashlight  and puffs and billows of what looked like luminous blue smoke  and explosions of sparks that would swirl up out of the thrusters    just like when you throw a log on a campfire and the embers swirl up off the campfire  but these were icy  blue embers. It was breathtaking. Now  usually if people are familiar with bioluminescence at all  it's these guys  it's fireflies. And there are a few other land dwellers that can make light    some insects  earthworms  fungi    but in general  on land  it's really rare. In the ocean  it's the rule rather than the exception. If I go out in the open ocean environment  virtually anywhere in the world  and I drag a net from       feet to the surface  most of the animals    in fact  in many places     to    percent of the animals that I bring up in that net    make light. This makes for some pretty spectacular light shows. Now I want to share with you a little video that I shot from a submersible. I first developed this technique working from a little single person submersible called Deep Rover and then adapted it for use on the Johnson Sea Link  which you see here. So  mounted in front of the observation sphere  there's a a three foot diameter hoop with a screen stretched across it. And inside the sphere with me is an intensified camera that's about as sensitive as a fully dark adapted human eye  albeit a little fuzzy. So you turn on the camera  turn out the lights. That sparkle you're seeing is not luminescence  that's just electronic noise on these super intensified cameras. You don't see luminescence until the submersible begins to move forward through the water  but as it does  animals bumping into the screen are stimulated to bioluminesce. Now  when I was first doing this  all I was trying to do was count the numbers of sources. I knew my forward speed  I knew the area  and so I could figure out how many hundreds of sources there were per cubic meter. But I started to realize that I could actually identify animals by the type of flashes they produced. And so  here  in the Gulf of Maine at     feet  I can name pretty much everything you're seeing there to the species level. Like those big explosions  sparks  are from a little comb jelly  and there's krill and other kinds of crustaceans  and jellyfish. There was another one of those comb jellies. And so I've worked with computer image analysis engineers to develop automatic recognition systems that can identify these animals and then extract the XYZ coordinate of the initial impact point. And we can then do the kinds of things that ecologists do on land  and do nearest neighbor distances. But you don't always have to go down to the depths of the ocean to see a light show like this. You can actually see it in surface waters. This is some shot  by Dr. Mike Latz at Scripps Institution  of a dolphin swimming through bioluminescent plankton. And this isn't someplace exotic like one of the bioluminescent bays in Puerto Rico  this was actually shot in San Diego Harbor. And sometimes you can see it even closer than that  because the heads on ships    that's toilets  for any land lovers that are listening    are flushed with unfiltered seawater that often has bioluminescent plankton in it. So  if you stagger into the head late at night and you're so toilet hugging sick that you forget to turn on the light  you may think that you're having a religious experience.  Laughter  So  how does a living creature make light  Well  that was the question that   th century French physiologist Raphael Dubois  asked about this bioluminescent clam. He ground it up and he managed to get out a couple of chemicals  one  the enzyme  he called luciferase  the substrate  he called luciferin after Lucifer the Lightbearer. That terminology has stuck  but it doesn't actually refer to specific chemicals because these chemicals come in a lot of different shapes and forms. In fact  most of the people studying bioluminescence today are focused on the chemistry  because these chemicals have proved so incredibly valuable for developing antibacterial agents  cancer fighting drugs  testing for the presence of life on Mars  detecting pollutants in our waters    which is how we use it at ORCA. In       the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded for work done on a molecule called green fluorescent protein that was isolated from the bioluminescent chemistry of a jellyfish  and it's been equated to the invention of the microscope  in terms of the impact that it has had on cell biology and genetic engineering. Another thing all these molecules are telling us that  apparently  bioluminescence has evolved at least    times  maybe as many as    separate times in evolutionary history  which is a clear indication of how spectacularly important this trait is for survival. So  what is it about bioluminescence that's so important to so many animals  Well  for animals that are trying to avoid predators by staying in the darkness  light can still be very useful for the three basic things that animals have to do to survive  and that's find food  attract a mate and avoid being eaten. So  for example  this fish has a built in headlight behind its eye that it can use for finding food or attracting a mate. And then when it's not using it  it actually can roll it down into its head just like the headlights on your Lamborghini. This fish actually has high beams. And this fish  which is one of my favorites  has three headlights on each side of its head. Now  this one is blue  and that's the color of most bioluminescence in the ocean because evolution has selected for the color that travels farthest through seawater in order to optimize communication. So  most animals make blue light  and most animals can only see blue light  but this fish is a really fascinating exception because it has two red light organs. And I have no idea why there's two  and that's something I want to solve some day    but not only can it see blue light  but it can see red light. So it uses its red bioluminescence like a sniper's scope to be able to sneak up on animals that are blind to red light and be able to see them without being seen. It's also got a little chin barbel here with a blue luminescent lure on it that it can use to attract prey from a long way off. And a lot of animals will use their bioluminescence as a lure. This is another one of my favorite fish. This is a viperfish  and it's got a lure on the end of a long fishing rod that it arches in front of the toothy jaw that gives the viperfish its name. The teeth on this fish are so long that if they closed inside the mouth of the fish  it would actually impale its own brain. So instead  it slides in grooves on the outside of the head. This is a Christmas tree of a fish  everything on this fish lights up  it's not just that lure. It's got a built in flashlight. It's got these jewel like light organs on its belly that it uses for a type of camouflage that obliterates its shadow  so when it's swimming around and there's a predator looking up from below  it makes itself disappear. It's got light organs in the mouth  it's got light organs in every single scale  in the fins  in a mucus layer on the back and the belly  all used for different things    some of which we know about  some of which we don't. And we know a little bit more about bioluminescence thanks to Pixar  and I'm very grateful to Pixar for sharing my favorite topic with so many people. I do wish  with their budget  that they might have spent just a tiny bit more money to pay a consulting fee to some poor  starving graduate student  who could have told them that those are the eyes of a fish that's been preserved in formalin. These are the eyes of a living anglerfish. So  she's got a lure that she sticks out in front of this living mousetrap of needle sharp teeth in order to attract in some unsuspecting prey. And this one has a lure with all kinds of little interesting threads coming off it. Now we used to think that the different shape of the lure was to attract different types of prey  but then stomach content analyses on these fish done by scientists  or more likely their graduate students  have revealed that they all eat pretty much the same thing. So  now we believe that the different shape of the lure is how the male recognizes the female in the anglerfish world  because many of these males are what are known as dwarf males. This little guy has no visible means of self support. He has no lure for attracting food and no teeth for eating it when it gets there. His only hope for existence on this planet is as a gigolo.  Laughter  He's got to find himself a babe and then he's got to latch on for life. So this little guy has found himself this babe  and you will note that he's had the good sense to attach himself in a way that he doesn't actually have to look at her. But he still knows a good thing when he sees it  and so he seals the relationship with an eternal kiss. His flesh fuses with her flesh  her bloodstream grows into his body  and he becomes nothing more than a little sperm sac. Well  this is a deep sea version of Women's Lib. She always knows where he is  and she doesn't have to be monogamous  because some of these females come up with multiple males attached. So they can use it for finding food  for attracting mates. They use it a lot for defense  many different ways. A lot of them can release their luciferin or luferase in the water just the way a squid or an octopus will release an ink cloud. This shrimp is actually spewing light out of its mouth like a fire breathing dragon in order to blind or distract this viperfish so that the shrimp can swim away into the darkness. And there are a lot of different animals that can do this  There's jellyfish  there's squid  there's a whole lot of different crustaceans  there's even fish that can do this. This fish is called the shining tubeshoulder because it actually has a tube on its shoulder that can squirt out light. And I was luck enough to capture one of these when we were on a trawling expedition off the northwest coast of Africa for  Blue Planet   for the deep portion of  Blue Planet.  And we were using a special trawling net that we were able to bring these animals up alive. So we captured one of these  and I brought it into the lab. So I'm holding it  and I'm about to touch that tube on its shoulder  and when I do  you'll see bioluminescence coming out. But to me  what's shocking is not just the amount of light  but the fact that it's not just luciferin and luciferase. For this fish  it's actually whole cells with nuclei and membranes. It's energetically very costly for this fish to do this  and we have no idea why it does it    another one of these great mysteries that needs to be solved. Now  another form of defense is something called a burglar alarm    same reason you have a burglar alarm on your car  the honking horn and flashing lights are meant to attract the attention of  hopefully  the police that will come and take the burglar away    when an animal's caught in the clutches of a predator  its only hope for escape may be to attract the attention of something bigger and nastier that will attack their attacker  thereby affording them a chance for escape. This jellyfish  for example  has a spectacular bioluminescent display. This is us chasing it in the submersible. That's not luminescence  that's reflected light from the gonads. We capture it in a very special device on the front of the submersible that allows us to bring it up in really pristine condition  bring it into the lab on the ship. And then to generate the display you're about to see  all I did was touch it once per second on its nerve ring with a sharp pick that's sort of like the sharp tooth of a fish. And once this display gets going  I'm not touching it anymore. This is an unbelievable light show. It's this pinwheel of light  and I've done calculations that show that this could be seen from as much as     feet away by a predator. And I thought   You know  that might actually make a pretty good lure.  Because one of the things that's frustrated me as a deep sea explorer is how many animals there probably are in the ocean that we know nothing about because of the way we explore the ocean. The primary way that we know about what lives in the ocean is we go out and drag nets behind ships. And I defy you to name any other branch of science that still depends on hundreds of year old technology. The other primary way is we go down with submersibles and remote operated vehicles. I've made hundreds of dives in submersibles. When I'm sitting in a submersible though  I know that I'm not unobtrusive at all    I've got bright lights and noisy thrusters    any animal with any sense is going to be long gone. So  I've wanted for a long time to figure out a different way to explore. And so  sometime ago  I got this idea for a camera system. It's not exactly rocket science. We call this thing Eye in the Sea. And scientists have done this on land for years  we just use a color that the animals can't see and then a camera that can see that color. You can't use infrared in the sea. We use far red light  but even that's a problem because it gets absorbed so quickly. Made an intensified camera  wanted to make this electronic jellyfish. Thing is  in science  you basically have to tell the funding agencies what you're going to discover before they'll give you the money. And I didn't know what I was going to discover  so I couldn't get the funding for this. So I kluged this together  I got the Harvey Mudd Engineering Clinic to actually do it as an undergraduate student project initially  and then I kluged funding from a whole bunch of different sources. Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute gave me time with their ROV so that I could test it and we could figure out  you know  for example  which colors of red light we had to use so that we could see the animals  but they couldn't see us    get the electronic jellyfish working. And you can see just what a shoestring operation this really was  because we cast these    blue LEDs in epoxy and you can see in the epoxy mold that we used  the word Ziploc is still visible. Needless to say  when it's kluged together like this  there were a lot of trials and tribulations getting this working. But there came a moment when it all came together  and everything worked. And  remarkably  that moment got caught on film by photographer Mark Richards  who happened to be there at the precise moment that we discovered that it all came together. That's me on the left  my graduate student at the time  Erika Raymond  and Lee Fry  who was the engineer on the project. And we have this photograph posted in our lab in a place of honor with the caption   Engineer satisfying two women at once.   Laughter  And we were very  very happy. So now we had a system that we could actually take to some place that was kind of like an oasis on the bottom of the ocean that might be patrolled by large predators. And so  the place that we took it to was this place called a Brine Pool  which is in the northern part of the Gulf of Mexico. It's a magical place. And I know this footage isn't going to look like anything to you    we had a crummy camera at the time    but I was ecstatic. We're at the edge of the Brine Pool  there's a fish that's swimming towards the camera. It's clearly undisturbed by us. And I had my window into the deep sea. I  for the first time  could see what animals were doing down there when we weren't down there disturbing them in some way. Four hours into the deployment  we had programmed the electronic jellyfish to come on for the first time. Eighty six seconds after it went into its pinwheel display  we recorded this  This is a squid  over six feet long  that is so new to science  it cannot be placed in any known scientific family. I could not have asked for a better proof of concept. And based on this  I went back to the National Science Foundation and said   This is what we will discover.  And they gave me enough money to do it right  which has involved developing the world's first deep sea webcam    which has been installed in the Monterey Canyon for the past year    and now  more recently  a modular form of this system  a much more mobile form that's a lot easier to launch and recover  that I hope can be used on Sylvia's  hope spots  to help explore and protect these areas  and  for me  learn more about the bioluminescence in these  hope spots.  So one of these take home messages here is  there is still a lot to explore in the oceans. And Sylvia has said that we are destroying the oceans before we even know what's in them  and she's right. So if you ever  ever get an opportunity to take a dive in a submersible  say yes    a thousand times  yes    and please turn out the lights. I promise  you'll love it. Thank you. Good morning. Happy to see so many fine folks out here and so many smiling faces. I have a very peculiar background  attitude and approach to the real world because I am a conjurer. Now  I prefer that term over magician  because if I were a magician  that would mean that I use spells and incantations and weird gestures in order to accomplish real magic. No  I don't do that  I'm a conjurer  who is someone who pretends to be a real magician.  Laughter  Now  how do we go about that sort of thing  We depend on the fact that audiences  such as yourselves  will make assumptions. For example  when I walked up here and I took the microphone from the stand and switched it on  you assumed this was a microphone  which it is not. As a matter of fact  this is something that about half of you  more than half of you will not be familiar with. It's a beard trimmer  you see  And it makes a very bad microphone  I've tried it many times.  Laughter  The other assumption that you made    and this little lesson is to show you that you will make assumptions. Not only that you can  but that you will when they are properly suggested to you. You believe I'm looking at you. Wrong. I'm not looking at you. I can't see you. I know you're out there  they told me backstage  it's a full house and such. I know you're there because I can hear you  but I can't see you because I normally wear glasses. These are not glasses  these are empty frames.  Laughter  Quite empty frames. Now why would a grown man appear before you wearing empty frames on his face  To fool you  ladies and gentlemen  to deceive you  to show that you  too  can make assumptions. Don't you ever forget that. Now  I have to do something    first of all  switch to real glasses so I can actually see you  which would probably be a convenience. I don't know. I haven't had a good look. Well  it's not that great a convenience. I have to do something now  which seems a little bit strange for a magician. But I'm going to take some medication. This is a full bottle of Calms Forte. I'll explain that in just a moment. Ignore the instructions  that's what the government has to put in there to confuse you  I'm sure. I will take enough of these. Mm. Indeed  the whole container. Thirty two tablets of Calms Forte. Now that I've done that    I'll explain it in a moment    I must tell you that I am an actor. I'm an actor who plays a specific part. I play the part of a magician  a wizard  if you will  a real wizard. If someone were to appear on this stage in front of me and actually claim to be an ancient prince of Denmark named Hamlet  you would be insulted and rightly so. Why would a man assume that you would believe something bizarre like this  But there exists out there a very large population of people who will tell you that they have psychic  magical powers that they can predict the future  that they can make contact with the deceased. Oh  they also say they will sell you astrology or other fortunetelling methods. Oh  they gladly sell you that  yes. And they also say that they can give you perpetual motion machines and free energy systems. They claim to be psychics  or sensitives  whatever they can. But the one thing that has made a big comeback just recently is this business of speaking with the dead. Now  to my innocent mind  dead implies incapable of communicating.  Laughter  You might agree with me on that. But these people  they tend to tell you that not only can they communicate with the dead     Hi  there     but they can hear the dead as well  and they can relay this information back to the living. I wonder if that's true. I don't think so  because this subculture of people use exactly the same gimmicks that we magicians do  exactly the same    the same physical methods  the same psychological methods    and they effectively and profoundly deceive millions of people around the earth  to their detriment. They deceive these people  costs them a lot of money  cost them a lot of emotional anguish. Billions of dollars are spent every year  all over the globe  on these charlatans. Now  I have two questions I would like to ask these people if I had the opportunity to do so. First question  If I want to ask them to call up    because they do hear them through the ear. They listen to the spirits like this    I'm going to ask you to call up the ghost of my grandmother because  when she died  she had the family will  and she secreted it someplace. We don't know where it is  so we ask Granny   Where is the will  Granny   What does Granny say  She says   I'm in heaven and it's wonderful. I'm here with all my old friends  my deceased friends  and my family and all the puppy dogs and the kittens that I used to have when I was a little girl. And I love you  and I'll always be with you. Good bye.  And she didn't answer the damn question  Where is the will  Now  she could easily have said   Oh  it's in the library on the second shelf  behind the encyclopedia   but she doesn't say that. No  she doesn't. She doesn't bring any useful information to us. We paid a lot of money for that information  be we didn't get it. The second question that I'd like to ask  rather simple  Suppose I ask them to contact the spirit of my deceased father in law  as an example. Why do they insist on saying    remember  they speak into this ear    why do they say   My name starts with J or M   Is this a hunting game  Hunting and fishing  What is it  Is it    questions  No  it's more like     questions. But it is a cruel  vicious  absolutely conscienceless    I'll be all right  keep your seats  Laughter     game that these people play. And they take advantage of the innocent  the naive  the grieving  the needy people out there. Now  this is a process that is called cold reading. There's one fellow out there  Van Praagh is his name  James Van Praagh. He's one of the big practitioners of this sort of thing. John Edward  Sylvia Browne and Rosemary Altea  they are other operators. There are hundreds of them all over the earth  but in this country  James Van Praagh is very big. And what does he do  He likes to tell you how the deceased got deceased  the people he's talking to through his ear  you see  So what he says is  very often  is like this  he says   He tells me  he tells me  before he passed  that he had trouble breathing.  Folks  that's what dying is all about  You stop breathing  and then you're dead. It's that simple. And that's the kind of information they're going to bring back to you  I don't think so. Now  these people will make guesses  they'll say things like   Why am I getting electricity  He's saying to me  'Electricity.' Was he an electrician    No.   Did he ever have an electric razor    No.  It was a game of hunting questions like this. This is what they go through. Now  folks often ask us at the James Randi Educational Foundation  they call me  they say   Why are you so concerned about this  Mr. Randi  Isn't it just a lot of fun   No  it is not fun. It is a cruel farce. Now  it may bring a certain amount of comfort  but that comfort lasts only about    minutes or so. And then the people look in the mirror  and they say  I just paid a lot of money for that reading. And what did she say to me  'I love you '  They always say that. They don't get any information  they don't get any value for what they spend. Now  Sylvia Browne is the big operator. We call her  The Talons.  Sylvia Browne    thank you    Sylvia Browne is the big operator in this field at this very moment. Now  Sylvia Browne    just to show you    she actually gets     dollars for a    minute reading over the telephone  she doesn't even go there in person  and you have to wait up to two years because she's booked ahead that amount of time. You pay by credit card or whatever  and then she will call you sometime in the next two years. You can tell it's her.  Hello  this is Sylvia Browne.  That's her  you can tell right away. Now  Montel Williams is an intelligent man. We all know who he is on television. He's well educated  he's smart  he knows what Sylvia Browne is doing but he doesn't give a damn. He just doesn't care. Because  the bottom line is  the sponsors love it  and he will expose her to television publicity all the time. Now  what does Sylvia Browne give you for that     dollars  She gives you the names of your guardian angels  that's first. Now  without that  how could we possibly function   Laughter  She gives you the names of previous lives  who you were in previous lives. Duh. It turns out that the women that she gives readings for were all Babylonian princesses  or something like that. And the men were all Grecian warriors fighting with Agamemnon. Nothing is ever said about a    year old bootblack in the streets of London who died of consumption. He isn't worth bringing back  obviously. And the strange thing    folks  you may have noticed this too. You see these folks on television    they never call anybody back from hell.  Laughter  Everyone comes back from heaven  but never from hell. If they call back any of my friends  they're not going to... Well  you see the story. Now  Sylvia Browne is an exception  an exception in one way  because the James Randi Educational Foundation  my foundation  offers a one million dollar prize in negotiable bonds. Very simply won. All you have to do is prove any paranormal  occult or supernatural event or power of any kind under proper observing conditions. It's very easy  win the million dollars. Sylvia Browne is an exception in that she's the only professional psychic in the whole world that has accepted our challenge. She did this on the  Larry King Live  show on CNN six and a half years ago. And we haven't heard from her since. Strange. She said that  first of all  that she didn't know how to contact me. Duh. A professional psychic who speaks to dead people  she can't reach me  I'm alive  you may have noticed. Well  pretty well anyway. She couldn't reach me. Now she says she doesn't want to reach me because I'm a godless person. All the more reason to take the million dollars  wouldn't you think  Sylvia  Now these people need to be stopped  seriously now. They need to be stopped because this is a cruel farce. We get people coming to the foundation all the time. They're ruined financially and emotionally because they've given their money and their faith to these people. Now  I popped some pills earlier. I have to explain that to you. Homeopathy  let's find out what that's all about. Hmm. You've heard of it. It's an alternative form of healing  right  Homeopathy actually consists    and that's what this is. This is Calms Forte     caplets of sleeping pills  I forgot to tell you that. I just ingested six and a half days worth of sleeping pills. Six and a half days  that certainly is a fatal dose. It says right on the back here   In case of overdose  contact your poison control center immediately   and it gives an     number. Keep your seats    it's going to be okay. I don't really need it because I've been doing this stunt for audiences all over the world for the last eight or    years  taking fatal doses of homeopathic sleeping pills. Why don't they affect me  The answer may surprise you. What is homeopathy  It's taking a medicine that really works and diluting it down well beyond Avogadro's limit. Diluting it down to the point where there's none of it left.  Laughter  Now folks  this is not just a metaphor I'm going to give you now  it's true. It's exactly equivalent to taking one     milligram aspirin tablet  throwing it into the middle of Lake Tahoe  and then stirring it up  obviously with a very big stick  and waiting two years or so until the solution is homogeneous. Then  when you get a headache  you take a sip of this water  and    voila     it is gone. Now that is true. That is what homeopathy is all about. And another claim that they make    you'll love this one    the more dilute the medicine is  they say  the more powerful it is. Now wait a minute  we heard about a guy in Florida. The poor man  he was on homeopathic medicine. He died of an overdose. He forgot to take his pill. Work on it. Work on it. It's a ridiculous thing. It is absolutely ridiculous. I don't know what we're doing  believing in all this nonsense over all these years. Now  let me tell you  The James Randi Educational Foundation is waving this very big carrot  but I must say  the fact that nobody has taken us up on this offer doesn't mean that the powers don't exist. They might  some place out there. Maybe these people are just independently wealthy. Well  with Sylvia Browne I would think so. You know      dollars for a    minute reading over the telephone    that's more than lawyers make  I mean that's a fabulous amount of money. These people don't need the million dollars perhaps  but wouldn't you think they'd like to take it just to make me look silly  Just to get rid of this godless person out there that Sylvia Browne talks about all the time  I think that something needs to be done about this. We really would love to have suggestions from you folks on how to contact federal  state and local authorities to get them to do something. If you find out    now I understand. We've seen people  even today  speaking to us about AIDS epidemics and starving kids around the world and impure water supplies that people have to suffer with. Those are very important  critically important to us. And we must do something about those problems. But at the same time  as Arthur C. Clarke said  The rotting of the human mind  the business of believing in the paranormal and the occult and the supernatural    all of this total nonsense  this medieval thinking    I think something should be done about that  and it all lies in education. Largely  it's the media who are to blame for this sort of thing. They shamelessly promote all kinds of nonsense of this sort because it pleases the sponsors. It's the bottom line  the dollar line. That's what they're looking at. We really must do something about this. I'm willing to take your suggestions  and I'm willing to have you tune in to our webpage. It's www.randi.org. Go in there and look at the archives  and you will begin to understand much more of what I've been talking about today. You will see the records that we have. There's nothing like sitting in that library and having a family appear there and say that Mum gave away all the family fortune. She cashed in the CDs  she gave away the stocks and the certificates. That's really sad to hear  and it hasn't helped them one bit  hasn't solved any of their problems. Yes  there could be a rotting of the American mind  and of the minds all the way around the earth  if we don't start to think sensibly about these things. Now  we've offered this carrot  as I say  we've dangled the carrot. We're waiting for the psychics to come forth and snap at it. Oh  we get lots of them  hundreds of them every year come by. These are dowsers and people who think that they can talk to the dead as well  but they're amateurs  they don't know how to evaluate their own so called powers. The professionals never come near us  except in that case of Sylvia Browne that I told you about a moment ago. She did accept and then backed away. Ladies and gentlemen  I'm James Randi  and I'm waiting. Thank you. The greatest irony in global health is that the poorest countries carry the largest disease burden. If we resize the countries of the globe in proportion to the subject of interest  we see that Sub Saharan Africa is the worst hit region by HIV AIDS. This is the most devastating epidemic of our time. We also see that this region has the least capability in terms of dealing with the disease. There are very few doctors and  quite frankly  these countries do not have the resources that are needed to cope with such epidemics. So what the Western countries  developed countries  have generously done is they have proposed to provide free drugs to all people in Third World countries who actually can't afford these medications. And this has already saved millions of lives  and it has prevented entire economies from capsizing in Sub Saharan Africa. But there is a fundamental problem that is killing the efforts in fighting this disease  because if you keep throwing drugs out at people who don't have diagnostic services  you end up creating a problem of drug resistance. This is already beginning to happen in Sub Saharan Africa. The problem is that  what begins as a tragedy in the Third World could easily become a global problem. And the last thing we want to see is drug resistant strains of HIV popping up all over the world  because it will make treatment more expensive and it could also restore the pre ARV carnage of HIV AIDS. I experienced this firsthand as a high school student in Uganda. This was in the   s during the peak of the HIV epidemic  before there were any ARVs in Sub Saharan Africa. And during that time  I actually lost more relatives  as well as the teachers who taught me  to HIV AIDS. So this became one of the driving passions of my life  to help find real solutions that could address these kinds of problems. We all know about the miracle of miniaturization. Back in the day  computers used to fill this entire room  and people actually used to work inside the computers. But what electronic miniaturization has done is that it has allowed people to shrink technology into a cell phone. And I'm sure everyone here enjoys cell phones that can actually be used in the remote areas of the world  in the Third World countries. The good news is that the same technology that allowed miniaturization of electronics is now allowing us to miniaturize biological laboratories. So  right now  we can actually miniaturize biological and chemistry laboratories onto microfluidic chips. I was very lucky to come to the US right after high school  and was able to work on this technology and develop some devices. This is a microfluidic chip that I developed. A close look at how the technology works  These are channels that are about the size of a human hair    so you have integrated valves  pumps  mixers and injectors    so you can fit entire diagnostic experiments onto a microfluidic system. So what I plan to do with this technology is to actually take the current state of the technology and build an HIV kit in a microfluidic system. So  with one microfluidic chip  which is the size of an iPhone  you can actually diagnose     patients at the same time. For each patient  we will be able to do up to     different viral loads per patient. And this is only done in four hours     times faster than the current state of the art  at a cost that will be five to     times cheaper than the current options. So this will allow us to create personalized medicines in the Third World at a cost that is actually achievable and make the world a safer place. I invite your interest as well as your involvement in driving this vision to a point of practical reality. Thank you very much. Several years ago here at TED  Peter Skillman introduced a design challenge called the marshmallow challenge. And the idea's pretty simple  Teams of four have to build the tallest free standing structure out of    sticks of spaghetti  one yard of tape  one yard of string and a marshmallow. The marshmallow has to be on top. And  though it seems really simple  it's actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly. And so  I thought this was an interesting idea  and I incorporated it into a design workshop. And it was a huge success. And since then  I've conducted about    design workshops across the world with students and designers and architects  even the CTOs of the Fortune     and there's something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration  and I'd like to share some of them with you. So  normally  most people begin by orienting themselves to the task. They talk about it  they figure out what it's going to look like  they jockey for power. Then they spend some time planning  organizing  they sketch and they lay out spaghetti. They spend the majority of their time assembling the sticks into ever growing structures. And then finally  just as they're running out of time  someone takes out the marshmallow  and then they gingerly put it on top  and then they stand back  and    ta da     they admire their work. But what really happens  most of the time  is that the  ta da  turns into an  uh oh   because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure to buckle and to collapse. So there are a number of people who have a lot more  uh oh  moments than others  and among the worst are recent graduates of business school. They lie  they cheat  they get distracted and they produce really lame structures. And of course there are teams that have a lot more  ta da  structures  and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten. And it's pretty amazing. As Peter tells us  not only do they produce the tallest structures  but they're the most interesting structures of them all. So the question you want to ask is  How come  Why  What is it about them  And Peter likes to say that none of the kids spend any time trying to be CEO of Spaghetti  Inc. Right  They don't spend time jockeying for power. But there's another reason as well. And the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan  right  And then they execute on it. And then what happens is  when they put the marshmallow on the top  they run out of time and what happens  It's a crisis. Sound familiar  Right. What kindergarteners do differently is that they start with the marshmallow  and they build prototypes  successive prototypes  always keeping the marshmallow on top  so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way. Designers recognize this type of collaboration as the essence of the iterative process. And with each version  kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesn't work. So the capacity to play in prototype is really essential  but let's look at how different teams perform. So the average for most people is around    inches  business schools students  about half of that  lawyers  a little better  but not much better than that  kindergarteners  better than most adults. Who does the very best  Architects and engineers  thankfully. Thirty nine inches is the tallest structure I've seen. And why is it  Because they understand triangles and self reinforcing geometrical patterns are the key to building stable structures. So CEOs  a little bit better than average  but here's where it gets interesting. If you put you put an executive admin. on the team  they get significantly better. It's incredible. You know  you look around  you go   Oh  that team's going to win.  You can just tell beforehand. And why is that  Because they have special skills of facilitation. They manage the process  they understand the process. And any team who manages and pays close attention to work will significantly improve the team's performance. Specialized skills and facilitation skills are the combination that leads to strong success. If you have    teams that typically perform  you'll get maybe six or so that have standing structures. And I tried something interesting. I thought  let's up the ante  once. So I offered a        dollar prize of software to the winning team. So what do you think happened to these design students  What was the result  Here's what happened  Not one team had a standing structure. If anyone had built  say  a one inch structure  they would have taken home the prize. So  isn't that interesting  That high stakes have a strong impact. We did the exercise again with the same students. What do you think happened then  So now they understand the value of prototyping. So the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best. They produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time. So there's deep lessons for us about the nature of incentives and success. So  you might ask  Why would anyone actually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge  And the reason is  I help create digital tools and processes to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects. And what the marshmallow challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions. Because  frankly  every project has its own marshmallow  doesn't it  The challenge provides a shared experience  a common language  a common stance to build the right prototype. And so  this is the value of the experience  of this so simple exercise. And those of you who are interested may want to go to MarshmallowChallenge.com. It's a blog that you can look at how to build the marshmallows. There's step by step instructions on this. There are crazy examples from around the world of how people tweak and adjust the system. There's world records that are on this as well. And the fundamental lesson  I believe  is that design truly is a contact sport. It demands that we bring all of our senses to the task  and that we apply the very best of our thinking  our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand. And sometimes  a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an  uh oh  moment to a  ta da  moment. And that can make a big difference. Thank you very much. One of the things that defines a TEDster is you've taken your passion  and you've turned it into stewardship. You actually put action to the issues you care about. But what you're going to find eventually is you may need to actually get elected officials to help you out. So  how do you do that  One of the things I should probably tell you is  I worked for the Discovery Channel early in my career  and that sort of warped my framework. So  when you start to think about politicians  you've got to realize these are strange creatures. Other than the fact that they can't tell directions  and they have very strange breeding habits  how do you actually work with these things   Laughter  What we need to understand is  What drives the political creature  And there are two things that are primary in a politician's heart  One is reputation and influence. These are the primary tools by which a politician can do his job. The second one    unlike most animals  which is survival of the species    this is preservation of self. Now you may think it's money  but that's actually sort of a proxy to what I can do to preserve myself. Now  the challenge with you moving your issue forward is these animals are getting broadcast to all the time. So  what doesn't work  in terms of getting your issue to be important  You can send them an email. Well  unfortunately  I've got so many Viagra ads coming at me  your email is lost. It doesn't matter  it's spam. How about you get on the phone  Well  chances are I've got a droid who's picking up the phone   Yes  they called  and they said they didn't like it.  That doesn't move. Face to face would work  but it's hard to set it up. It's hard to get the context and actually get the communication to work. Yes  contributions actually do make a difference and they set a context for having a conversation  but it takes some time to build up. So what actually works  And the answer is rather strange. It's a letter. We live in a digital world  but we're fairly analog creatures. Letters actually work. Even the top dog himself takes time every day to read    letters that are picked out by staff. I can tell you that every official that I've ever worked with will tell you about the letters they get and what they mean. So  how are you going to write your letter  First of all  you're going to pick up an analog device  a pen. I know these are tough  and you may have a hard time getting your hand bent around it   Laughter  but this is actually critical. And it is critical that you actually handwrite your letter. It is so novel to see this  that somebody actually picked up an analog device and has written to me. Second of all  I'm going to recommend that you get into a proactive stance and write to your elected officials at least once a month. Here's my promise to you  If you are consistent and do this  within three months the elected official will start calling you when that issue comes up and say   What do you think   Now  I'm going to give you a four paragraph format to work with. Now  when you approach these animals  you need to understand there's a dangerous end to them  and you also need to approach them with some level of respect and a little bit of wariness. So in paragraph number one  what I'm going to tell you to do is very simply this  You appreciate them. You may not appreciate the person  you may not appreciate anything else  but maybe you appreciate the fact that they've got a tough gig. When animals are going to make a point  they make the point. They don't spend a lot of time dicking around. So  here you go.  Laughter  Paragraph number two  You may actually have to just get very blunt and say what's really on your mind. When you do this  don't attack people  you attack tactics. Ad hominem attacks will get you nowhere. Paragraph number three  When animals are attacked or cornered  they will fight to the death  so you have to give them an exit. Most of the time  if they have an exit strategy  they should take it.  Obviously  you're intelligent. If you had the right information  you would have done the right thing.   Laughter  Lastly  you want to be the nurturing agent. You're the safe place to come in to. So  in paragraph number four  you're going to tell people   If no one is providing you with this information  let me help.   Laughter  Animals do displays. They do two things  They warn you or they try to attract you and say   We need to mate.  You're going to do that by the way you sign your letter. You do a number of things  you're a vice president  you volunteer  you do something else. Why is is this important  Because this establishes the two primary criteria for the political creature  that you have influence in a large sphere  and that my preservation depends on you. Here is one very quick hack  especially for the feds in the audience. Here's how you mail your letter. First of all  you send the original to the district office. So  you send the copy to the main office. If they follow protocol  they'll pick up the phone and say   Hey  do you have the original   Then some droid in the back puts the name on a tickler and says   Oh  this is an important letter.  And you actually get into the folder that the elected official actually has to read. So  what your letter means  I've got to tell you  we are all in a party  and political officials are the pinatas. We are harangued  lectured to  sold  marketed  but a letter is actually one of the few times that we have honest communication. I got this letter when I was first elected  and I still carry it to every council meeting I go to. This is an opportunity at real dialogue  and if you have stewardship and want to communicate  that dialogue is incredibly powerful. So when you do that  here's what I can promise  You're going to be the     pound gorilla in the forest. Get writing. Salaam. Namaskar. Good morning. Given my TED profile  you might be expecting that I'm going to speak to you about the latest philanthropic trends    the one that's currently got Wall Street and the World Bank buzzing    how to invest in women  how to empower them  how to save them. Not me. I am interested in how women are saving us. They're saving us by redefining and re imagining a future that defies and blurs accepted polarities  polarities we've taken for granted for a long time  like the ones between modernity and tradition  First World and Third World  oppression and opportunity. In the midst of the daunting challenges we face as a global community  there's something about this third way raga that is making my heart sing. What intrigues me most is how women are doing this  despite a set of paradoxes that are both frustrating and fascinating. Why is it that women are  on the one hand  viciously oppressed by cultural practices  and yet at the same time  are the preservers of cultures in most societies  Is the hijab or the headscarf a symbol of submission or resistance  When so many women and girls are beaten  raped  maimed on a daily basis in the name of all kinds of causes    honor  religion  nationality    what allows women to replant trees  to rebuild societies  to lead radical  non violent movements for social change  Is it different women who are doing the preserving and the radicalizing  Or are they one and the same  Are we guilty  as Chimamanda Adichie reminded us at the TED conference in Oxford  of assuming that there is a single story of women's struggles for their rights while there are  in fact  many  And what  if anything  do men have to do with it  Much of my life has been a quest to get some answers to these questions. It's taken me across the globe and introduced me to some amazing people. In the process  I've gathered a few fragments that help me shed some light on this puzzle. Among those who've helped open my eyes to a third way are  a devout Muslim in Afghanistan  a group of harmonizing lesbians in Croatia and a taboo breaker in Liberia. I'm indebted to them  as I am to my parents  who for some set of misdemeanors in their last life  were blessed with three daughters in this one. And for reasons equally unclear to me  seem to be inordinately proud of the three of us. I was born and raised here in India  and I learned from an early age to be deeply suspicious of the aunties and uncles who would bend down  pat us on the head and then say to my parents with no problem at all   Poor things. You only have three daughters. But you're young  you could still try again.  My sense of outrage about women's rights was brought to a boil when I was about   . My aunt  an incredibly articulate and brilliant woman  was widowed early. A flock of relatives descended on her. They took off her colorful sari. They made her wear a white one. They wiped her bindi off her forehead. They broke her bangles. Her daughter  Rani  a few years older than me  sat in her lap bewildered  not knowing what had happened to the confident woman she once knew as her mother. Late that night  I heard my mother begging my father   Please do something Ramu. Can't you intervene   And my father  in a low voice  muttering   I'm just the youngest brother  there's nothing I can do. This is tradition.  That's the night I learned the rules about what it means to be female in this world. Women don't make those rules  but they define us  and they define our opportunities and our chances. And men are affected by those rules too. My father  who had fought in three wars  could not save his own sister from this suffering. By     under the excellent tutelage of my mother  I was therefore  as you might expect  defiantly feminist. On the streets chanting    Hindi   Hindi  We are the women of India. We are not flowers  we are sparks of change.  By the time I got to Beijing in       it was clear to me  the only way to achieve gender equality was to overturn centuries of oppressive tradition. Soon after I returned from Beijing  I leapt at the chance to work for this wonderful organization  founded by women  to support women's rights organizations around the globe. But barely six months into my new job  I met a woman who forced me to challenge all my assumptions. Her name is Sakena Yacoobi. She walked into my office at a time when no one knew where Afghanistan was in the United States. She said to me   It is not about the burka.  She was the most determined advocate for women's rights I had ever heard. She told me women were running underground schools in her communities inside Afghanistan  and that her organization  the Afghan Institute of Learning  had started a school in Pakistan. She said   The first thing anyone who is a Muslim knows is that the Koran requires and strongly supports literacy. The prophet wanted every believer to be able to read the Koran for themselves.  Had I heard right  Was a women's rights advocate invoking religion  But Sakena defies labels. She always wears a headscarf  but I've walked alongside with her on a beach with her long hair flying in the breeze. She starts every lecture with a prayer  but she's a single  feisty  financially independent woman in a country where girls are married off at the age of   . She is also immensely pragmatic.  This headscarf and these clothes   she says   give me the freedom to do what I need to do to speak to those whose support and assistance are critical for this work. When I had to open the school in the refugee camp  I went to see the imam. I told him  'I'm a believer  and women and children in these terrible conditions need their faith to survive.'  She smiles slyly.  He was flattered. He began to come twice a week to my center because women could not go to the mosque. And after he would leave  women and girls would stay behind. We began with a small literacy class to read the Koran  then a math class  then an English class  then computer classes. In a few weeks  everyone in the refugee camp was in our classes.  Sakena is a teacher at a time when to educate women is a dangerous business in Afghanistan. She is on the Taliban's hit list. I worry about her every time she travels across that country. She shrugs when I ask her about safety.  Kavita jaan  we cannot allow ourselves to be afraid. Look at those young girls who go back to school when acid is thrown in their face.  And I smile  and I nod  realizing I'm watching women and girls using their own religious traditions and practices  turning them into instruments of opposition and opportunity. Their path is their own and it looks towards an Afghanistan that will be different. Being different is something the women of Lesbor in Zagreb  Croatia know all too well. To be a lesbian  a dyke  a homosexual in most parts of the world  including right here in our country  India  is to occupy a place of immense discomfort and extreme prejudice. In post conflict societies like Croatia  where a hyper nationalism and religiosity have created an environment unbearable for anyone who might be considered a social outcast. So enter a group of out dykes  young women who love the old music that once spread across that region from Macedonia to Bosnia  from Serbia to Slovenia. These folk singers met at college at a gender studies program. Many are in their   s  some are mothers. Many have struggled to come out to their communities  in families whose religious beliefs make it hard to accept that their daughters are not sick  just queer. As Leah  one of the founders of the group  says   I like traditional music very much. I also like rock and roll. So Lesbor  we blend the two. I see traditional music like a kind of rebellion  in which people can really speak their voice  especially traditional songs from other parts of the former Yugoslav Republic. After the war  lots of these songs were lost  but they are a part of our childhood and our history  and we should not forget them.  Improbably  this LGBT singing choir has demonstrated how women are investing in tradition to create change  like alchemists turning discord into harmony. Their repertoire includes the Croatian national anthem  a Bosnian love song and Serbian duets. And  Leah adds with a grin   Kavita  we especially are proud of our Christmas music  because it shows we are open to religious practices even though Catholic Church hates us LGBT.  Their concerts draw from their own communities  yes  but also from an older generation  a generation that might be suspicious of homosexuality  but is nostalgic for its own music and the past it represents. One father  who had initially balked at his daughter coming out in such a choir  now writes songs for them. In the Middle Ages  troubadours would travel across the land singing their tales and sharing their verses  Lesbor travels through the Balkans like this  singing  connecting people divided by religion  nationality and language. Bosnians  Croats and Serbs find a rare shared space of pride in their history  and Lesbor reminds them that the songs one group often claims as theirs alone really belong to them all. Yesterday  Mallika Sarabhai showed us that music can create a world more accepting of difference than the one we have been given. The world Leymah Gbowee was given was a world at war. Liberia had been torn apart by civil strife for decades. Leymah was not an activist  she was a mother of three. But she was sick with worry  She worried her son would be abducted and taken off to be a child soldier  she worried her daughters would be raped  she worried for their lives. One night  she had a dream. She dreamt she and thousands of other women ended the bloodshed. The next morning at church  she asked others how they felt. They were all tired of the fighting. We need peace  and we need our leaders to know we will not rest until there is peace. Among Leymah's friends was a policewoman who was Muslim. She promised to raise the issue with her community. At the next Friday sermon  the women who were sitting in the side room of the mosque began to share their distress at the state of affairs.  What does it matter   they said   A bullet doesn't distinguish between a Muslim and a Christian.  This small group of women  determined to bring an end to the war  and they chose to use their traditions to make a point  Liberian women usually wear lots of jewelry and colorful clothing. But no  for the protest  they dressed all in white  no makeup. As Leymah said   We wore the white saying we were out for peace.  They stood on the side of the road on which Charles Taylor's motorcade passed every day. They stood for weeks    first just     then     then     then hundreds of women    wearing white  singing  dancing  saying they were out for peace. Eventually  opposing forces in Liberia were pushed to hold peace talks in Ghana. The peace talks dragged on and on and on. Leymah and her sisters had had enough. With their remaining funds  they took a small group of women down to the venue of the peace talks and they surrounded the building. In a now famous CNN clip  you can see them sitting on the ground  their arms linked. We know this in India. It's called a  Hindi . Then things get tense. The police are called in to physically remove the women. As the senior officer approaches with a baton  Leymah stands up with deliberation  reaches her arms up over her head  and begins  very slowly  to untie her headdress that covers her hair. You can see the policeman's face. He looks embarrassed. He backs away. And the next thing you know  the police have disappeared. Leymah said to me later   It's a taboo  you know  in West Africa. If an older woman undresses in front of a man because she wants to  the man's family is cursed.  She said   I don't know if he did it because he believed  but he knew we were not going to leave. We were not going to leave until the peace accord was signed.  And the peace accord was signed. And the women of Liberia then mobilized in support of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf  a woman who broke a few taboos herself becoming the first elected woman head of state in Africa in years. When she made her presidential address  she acknowledged these brave women of Liberia who allowed her to win against a football star    that's soccer for you Americans    no less. Women like Sakena and Leah and Leymah have humbled me and changed me and made me realize that I should not be so quick to jump to assumptions of any kind. They've also saved me from my righteous anger by offering insights into this third way. A Filipina activist once said to me   How do you cook a rice cake  With heat from the bottom and heat from the top.  The protests  the marches  the uncompromising position that women's rights are human rights  full stop. That's the heat from the bottom. That's Malcolm X and the suffragists and gay pride parades. But we also need the heat from the top. And in most parts of the world  that top is still controlled by men. So to paraphrase Marx  Women make change  but not in circumstances of their own choosing. They have to negotiate. They have to subvert tradition that once silenced them in order to give voice to new aspirations. And they need allies from their communities. Allies like the imam  allies like the father who now writes songs for a lesbian group in Croatia  allies like the policeman who honored a taboo and backed away  allies like my father  who couldn't help his sister but has helped three daughters pursue their dreams. Maybe this is because feminism  unlike almost every other social movement  is not a struggle against a distinct oppressor    it's not the ruling class or the occupiers or the colonizers    it's against a deeply held set of beliefs and assumptions that we women  far too often  hold ourselves. And perhaps this is the ultimate gift of feminism  that the personal is in fact the political. So that  as Eleanor Roosevelt said once of human rights  the same is true of gender equality  that it starts in small places  close to home. On the streets  yes  but also in negotiations at the kitchen table and in the marital bed and in relationships between lovers and parents and sisters and friends. And then you realize that by integrating aspects of tradition and community into their struggles  women like Sakena and Leah and Leymah    but also women like Sonia Gandhi here in India and Michelle Bachelet in Chile and Shirin Ebadi in Iran    are doing something else. They're challenging the very notion of Western models of development. They are saying  we don't have to be like you to make change. We can wear a sari or a hijab or pants or a boubou  and we can be party leaders and presidents and human rights lawyers. We can use our tradition to navigate change. We can demilitarize societies and pour resources  instead  into reservoirs of genuine security. It is in these little stories  these individual stories  that I see a radical epic being written by women around the world. It is in these threads that are being woven into a resilient fabric that will sustain communities  that I find hope. And if my heart is singing  it's because in these little fragments  every now and again  you catch a glimpse of a whole  of a whole new world. And she is definitely on her way. Thank you. So I want to talk today about an idea. It's a big idea. Actually  I think it'll eventually be seen as probably the single biggest idea that's emerged in the past century. It's the idea of computation. Now  of course  that idea has brought us all of the computer technology we have today and so on. But there's actually a lot more to computation than that. It's really a very deep  very powerful  very fundamental idea  whose effects we've only just begun to see. Well  I myself have spent the past    years of my life working on three large projects that really try to take the idea of computation seriously. So I started off at a young age as a physicist using computers as tools. Then  I started drilling down  thinking about the computations I might want to do  trying to figure out what primitives they could be built up from and how they could be automated as much as possible. Eventually  I created a whole structure based on symbolic programming and so on that let me build Mathematica. And for the past    years  at an increasing rate  we've been pouring more and more ideas and capabilities and so on into Mathematica  and I'm happy to say that that's led to many good things in R   D and education  lots of other areas. Well  I have to admit  actually  that I also had a very selfish reason for building Mathematica  I wanted to use it myself  a bit like Galileo got to use his telescope     years ago. But I wanted to look not at the astronomical universe  but at the computational universe. So we normally think of programs as being complicated things that we build for very specific purposes. But what about the space of all possible programs  Here's a representation of a really simple program. So  if we run this program  this is what we get. Very simple. So let's try changing the rule for this program a little bit. Now we get another result  still very simple. Try changing it again. You get something a little bit more complicated. But if we keep running this for a while  we find out that although the pattern we get is very intricate  it has a very regular structure. So the question is  Can anything else happen  Well  we can do a little experiment. Let's just do a little mathematical experiment  try and find out. Let's just run all possible programs of the particular type that we're looking at. They're called cellular automata. You can see a lot of diversity in the behavior here. Most of them do very simple things  but if you look along all these different pictures  at rule number     you start to see something interesting going on. So let's take a closer look at rule number    here. So here it is. We're just following this very simple rule at the bottom here  but we're getting all this amazing stuff. It's not at all what we're used to  and I must say that  when I first saw this  it came as a huge shock to my intuition. And  in fact  to understand it  I eventually had to create a whole new kind of science. This science is different  more general  than the mathematics based science that we've had for the past     or so years. You know  it's always seemed like a big mystery  how nature  seemingly so effortlessly  manages to produce so much that seems to us so complex. Well  I think we've found its secret  It's just sampling what's out there in the computational universe and quite often getting things like Rule    or like this. And knowing that starts to explain a lot of long standing mysteries in science. It also brings up new issues  though  like computational irreducibility. I mean  we're used to having science let us predict things  but something like this is fundamentally irreducible. The only way to find its outcome is  effectively  just to watch it evolve. It's connected to  what I call  the principle of computational equivalence  which tells us that even incredibly simple systems can do computations as sophisticated as anything. It doesn't take lots of technology or biological evolution to be able to do arbitrary computation  just something that happens  naturally  all over the place. Things with rules as simple as these can do it. Well  this has deep implications about the limits of science  about predictability and controllability of things like biological processes or economies  about intelligence in the universe  about questions like free will and about creating technology. You know  in working on this science for many years  I kept wondering   What will be its first killer app   Well  ever since I was a kid  I'd been thinking about systematizing knowledge and somehow making it computable. People like Leibniz had wondered about that too     years earlier. But I'd always assumed that to make progress  I'd essentially have to replicate a whole brain. Well  then I got to thinking  This scientific paradigm of mine suggests something different    and  by the way  I've now got huge computation capabilities in Mathematica  and I'm a CEO with some worldly resources to do large  seemingly crazy  projects    So I decided to just try to see how much of the systematic knowledge that's out there in the world we could make computable. So  it's been a big  very complex project  which I was not sure was going to work at all. But I'm happy to say it's actually going really well. And last year we were able to release the first website version of Wolfram Alpha. Its purpose is to be a serious knowledge engine that computes answers to questions. So let's give it a try. Let's start off with something really easy. Hope for the best. Very good. Okay. So far so good. Let's try something a little bit harder. Let's do some mathy thing  and with luck it'll work out the answer and try and tell us some interesting things things about related math. We could ask it something about the real world. Let's say    I don't know    what's the GDP of Spain  And it should be able to tell us that. Now we could compute something related to this  let's say ... the GDP of Spain divided by  I don't know  the    hmmm ... let's say the revenue of Microsoft. The idea is that we can just type this in  this kind of question in  however we think of it. So let's try asking a question  like a health related question. So let's say we have a lab finding that ... you know  we have an LDL level of     for a male aged   . So let's type that in  and now Wolfram Alpha will go and use available public health data and try and figure out what part of the population that corresponds to and so on. Or let's try asking about  I don't know  the International Space Station. And what's happening here is that Wolfram Alpha is not just looking up something  it's computing  in real time  where the International Space Station is right now at this moment  how fast it's going  and so on. So Wolfram Alpha knows about lots and lots of kinds of things. It's got  by now  pretty good coverage of everything you might find in a standard reference library. But the goal is to go much further and  very broadly  to democratize all of this knowledge  and to try and be an authoritative source in all areas. To be able to compute answers to specific questions that people have  not by searching what other people may have written down before  but by using built in knowledge to compute fresh new answers to specific questions. Now  of course  Wolfram Alpha is a monumentally huge  long term project with lots and lots of challenges. For a start  one has to curate a zillion different sources of facts and data  and we built quite a pipeline of Mathematica automation and human domain experts for doing this. But that's just the beginning. Given raw facts or data to actually answer questions  one has to compute  one has to implement all those methods and models and algorithms and so on that science and other areas have built up over the centuries. Well  even starting from Mathematica  this is still a huge amount of work. So far  there are about   million lines of Mathematica code in Wolfram Alpha built by experts from many  many different fields. Well  a crucial idea of Wolfram Alpha is that you can just ask it questions using ordinary human language  which means that we've got to be able to take all those strange utterances that people type into the input field and understand them. And I must say that I thought that step might just be plain impossible. Two big things happened  First  a bunch of new ideas about linguistics that came from studying the computational universe  and second  the realization that having actual computable knowledge completely changes how one can set about understanding language. And  of course  now with Wolfram Alpha actually out in the wild  we can learn from its actual usage. And  in fact  there's been an interesting coevolution that's been going on between Wolfram Alpha and its human users  and it's really encouraging. Right now  if we look at web queries  more than    percent of them get handled successfully the first time. And if you look at things like the iPhone app  the fraction is considerably larger. So  I'm pretty pleased with it all. But  in many ways  we're still at the very beginning with Wolfram Alpha. I mean  everything is scaling up very nicely and we're getting more confident. You can expect to see Wolfram Alpha technology showing up in more and more places  working both with this kind of public data  like on the website  and with private knowledge for people and companies and so on. You know  I've realized that Wolfram Alpha actually gives one a whole new kind of computing that one can call knowledge based computing  in which one's starting not just from raw computation  but from a vast amount of built in knowledge. And when one does that  one really changes the economics of delivering computational things  whether it's on the web or elsewhere. You know  we have a fairly interesting situation right now. On the one hand  we have Mathematica  with its sort of precise  formal language and a huge network of carefully designed capabilities able to get a lot done in just a few lines. Let me show you a couple of examples here. So here's a trivial piece of Mathematica programming. Here's something where we're sort of integrating a bunch of different capabilities here. Here we'll just create  in this line  a little user interface that allows us to do something fun there. If you go on  that's a slightly more complicated program that's now doing all sorts of algorithmic things and creating user interface and so on. But it's something that is very precise stuff. It's a precise specification with a precise formal language that causes Mathematica to know what to do here. Then on the other hand  we have Wolfram Alpha  with all the messiness of the world and human language and so on built into it. So what happens when you put these things together  I think it's actually rather wonderful. With Wolfram Alpha inside Mathematica  you can  for example  make precise programs that call on real world data. Here's a real simple example. You can also just sort of give vague input and then try and have Wolfram Alpha figure out what you're talking about. Let's try this here. But actually I think the most exciting thing about this is that it really gives one the chance to democratize programming. I mean  anyone will be able to say what they want in plain language. Then  the idea is that Wolfram Alpha will be able to figure out what precise pieces of code can do what they're asking for and then show them examples that will let them pick what they need to build up bigger and bigger  precise programs. So  sometimes  Wolfram Alpha will be able to do the whole thing immediately and just give back a whole big program that you can then compute with. Here's a big website where we've been collecting lots of educational and other demonstrations about lots of kinds of things. I'll show you one example here. This is just an example of one of these computable documents. This is probably a fairly small piece of Mathematica code that's able to be run here. Okay. Let's zoom out again. So  given our new kind of science  is there a general way to use it to make technology  So  with physical materials  we're used to going around the world and discovering that particular materials are useful for particular technological purposes. Well  it turns out we can do very much the same kind of thing in the computational universe. There's an inexhaustible supply of programs out there. The challenge is to see how to harness them for human purposes. Something like Rule     for example  turns out to be a really good randomness generator. Other simple programs are good models for processes in the natural or social world. And  for example  Wolfram Alpha and Mathematica are actually now full of algorithms that we discovered by searching the computational universe. And  for example  this    if we go back here    this has become surprisingly popular among composers finding musical forms by searching the computational universe. In a sense  we can use the computational universe to get mass customized creativity. I'm hoping we can  for example  use that even to get Wolfram Alpha to routinely do invention and discovery on the fly  and to find all sorts of wonderful stuff that no engineer and no process of incremental evolution would ever come up with. Well  so  that leads to kind of an ultimate question  Could it be that someplace out there in the computational universe we might find our physical universe  Perhaps there's even some quite simple rule  some simple program for our universe. Well  the history of physics would have us believe that the rule for the universe must be pretty complicated. But in the computational universe  we've now seen how rules that are incredibly simple can produce incredibly rich and complex behavior. So could that be what's going on with our whole universe  If the rules for the universe are simple  it's kind of inevitable that they have to be very abstract and very low level  operating  for example  far below the level of space or time  which makes it hard to represent things. But in at least a large class of cases  one can think of the universe as being like some kind of network  which  when it gets big enough  behaves like continuous space in much the same way as having lots of molecules can behave like a continuous fluid. Well  then the universe has to evolve by applying little rules that progressively update this network. And each possible rule  in a sense  corresponds to a candidate universe. Actually  I haven't shown these before  but here are a few of the candidate universes that I've looked at. Some of these are hopeless universes  completely sterile  with other kinds of pathologies like no notion of space  no notion of time  no matter  other problems like that. But the exciting thing that I've found in the last few years is that you actually don't have to go very far in the computational universe before you start finding candidate universes that aren't obviously not our universe. Here's the problem  Any serious candidate for our universe is inevitably full of computational irreducibility. Which means that it is irreducibly difficult to find out how it will really behave  and whether it matches our physical universe. A few years ago  I was pretty excited to discover that there are candidate universes with incredibly simple rules that successfully reproduce special relativity  and even general relativity and gravitation  and at least give hints of quantum mechanics. So  will we find the whole of physics  I don't know for sure  but I think at this point it's sort of almost embarrassing not to at least try. Not an easy project. One's got to build a lot of technology. One's got to build a structure that's probably at least as deep as existing physics. And I'm not sure what the best way to organize the whole thing is. Build a team  open it up  offer prizes and so on. But I'll tell you  here today  that I'm committed to seeing this project done  to see if  within this decade  we can finally hold in our hands the rule for our universe and know where our universe lies in the space of all possible universes ... and be able to type into Wolfram Alpha   the theory of the universe   and have it tell us. So I've been working on the idea of computation now for more than    years  building tools and methods and turning intellectual ideas into millions of lines of code and grist for server farms and so on. With every passing year  I realize how much more powerful the idea of computation really is. It's taken us a long way already  but there's so much more to come. From the foundations of science to the limits of technology to the very definition of the human condition  I think computation is destined to be the defining idea of our future. Thank you. Chris Anderson  That was astonishing. Stay here. I've got a question. So  that was  fair to say  an astonishing talk. Are you able to say in a sentence or two how this type of thinking could integrate at some point to things like string theory or the kind of things that people think of as the fundamental explanations of the universe  Stephen Wolfram  Well  the parts of physics that we kind of know to be true  things like the standard model of physics  what I'm trying to do better reproduce the standard model of physics or it's simply wrong. The things that people have tried to do in the last    years or so with string theory and so on have been an interesting exploration that has tried to get back to the standard model  but hasn't quite gotten there. My guess is that some great simplifications of what I'm doing may actually have considerable resonance with what's been done in string theory  but that's a complicated math thing that I don't yet know how it's going to work out. CA  Benoit Mandelbrot is in the audience. He also has shown how complexity can arise out of a simple start. Does your work relate to his  SW  I think so. I view Benoit Mandelbrot's work as one of the founding contributions to this kind of area. Benoit has been particularly interested in nested patterns  in fractals and so on  where the structure is something that's kind of tree like  and where there's sort of a big branch that makes little branches and even smaller branches and so on. That's one of the ways that you get towards true complexity. I think things like the Rule    cellular automaton get us to a different level. In fact  in a very precise way  they get us to a different level because they seem to be things that are capable of complexity that's sort of as great as complexity can ever get ... I could go on about this at great length  but I won't.  Laughter   Applause  CA  Stephen Wolfram  thank you. Hi  my name is Roz Savage and I row across oceans. Four years ago  I rowed solo across the Atlantic  and since then  I've done two out of three stages across the Pacific  from San Francisco to Hawaii and from Hawaii to Kiribati. And tomorrow  I'll be leaving this boat to fly back to Kiribati to continue with the third and final stage of my row across the Pacific. Cumulatively  I will have rowed over       miles  taken over three million oar strokes and spent more than     days alone on the ocean on a    foot rowboat. This has given me a very special relationship with the ocean. We have a bit of a love hate thing going on. I feel a bit about it like I did about a very strict math teacher that I once had at school. I didn't always like her  but I did respect her  and she taught me a heck of a lot. So today I'd like to share with you some of my ocean adventures and tell you a little bit about what they've taught me  and how I think we can maybe take some of those lessons and apply them to this environmental challenge that we face right now. Now  some of you might be thinking   Hold on a minute. She doesn't look very much like an ocean rower. Isn't she meant to be about this tall and about this wide and maybe look a bit more like these guys   You'll notice  they've all got something that I don't. Well  I don't know what you're thinking  but I'm talking about the beards.  Laughter  And no matter how long I've spent on the ocean  I haven't yet managed to muster a decent beard  and I hope that it remains that way. For a long time  I didn't believe that I could have a big adventure. The story that I told myself was that adventurers looked like this. I didn't look the part. I thought there were them and there were us  and I was not one of them. So for    years  I conformed. I did what people from my kind of background were supposed to do. I was working in an office in London as a management consultant. And I think I knew from day one that it wasn't the right job for me. But that kind of conditioning just kept me there for so many years  until I reached my mid   s and I thought   You know  I'm not getting any younger. I feel like I've got a purpose in this life  and I don't know what it is  but I'm pretty certain that management consultancy is not it. So  fast forward a few years. I'd gone through some changes. To try and answer that question of   What am I supposed to be doing with my life   I sat down one day and wrote two versions of my own obituary  the one that I wanted  a life of adventure  and the one that I was actually heading for which was a nice  normal  pleasant life  but it wasn't where I wanted to be by the end of my life. I wanted to live a life that I could be proud of. And I remember looking at these two versions of my obituary and thinking   Oh boy  I'm on totally the wrong track here. If I carry on living as I am now  I'm just not going to end up where I want to be in five years  or    years  or at the end of my life.  I made a few changes  let go of some loose trappings of my old life  and through a bit of a leap of logic  decided to row across the Atlantic Ocean. The Atlantic Rowing Race runs from the Canaries to Antigua  it's about       miles  and it turned out to be the hardest thing I had ever done. Sure  I had wanted to get outside of my comfort zone  but what I'd sort of failed to notice was that getting out of your comfort zone is  by definition  extremely uncomfortable. And my timing was not great either        when I did the Atlantic  was the year of Hurricane Katrina. There were more tropical storms in the North Atlantic than ever before  since records began. And pretty early on  those storms started making their presence known. All four of my oars broke before I reached halfway across. Oars are not supposed to look like this. But what can you do  You're in the middle of the ocean. Oars are your only means of propulsion. So I just had to look around the boat and figure out what I was going to use to fix up these oars so that I could carry on. So I found a boat hook and my trusty duct tape and splintered the boat hook to the oars to reinforce it. Then  when that gave out  I sawed the wheel axles off my spare rowing seat and used those. And then when those gave out  I cannibalized one of the broken oars. I'd never been very good at fixing stuff when I was living my old life  but it's amazing how resourceful you can become when you're in the middle of the ocean and there's only one way to get to the other side. And the oars kind of became a symbol of just in how many ways I went beyond what I thought were my limits. I suffered from tendinitis on my shoulders and saltwater sores on my bottom. I really struggled psychologically  totally overwhelmed by the scale of the challenge  realizing that  if I carried on moving at two miles an hour        miles was going to take me a very  very long time. There were so many times when I thought I'd hit that limit  but had no choice but to just carry on and try and figure out how I was going to get to the other side without driving myself crazy. And eventually after     days at sea  I arrived in Antigua. I don't think I've ever felt so happy in my entire life. It was a bit like finishing a marathon and getting out of solitary confinement and winning an Oscar all rolled into one. I was euphoric. And to see all the people coming out to greet me and standing along the cliff tops and clapping and cheering  I just felt like a movie star. It was absolutely wonderful. And I really learned then that  the bigger the challenge  the bigger the sense of achievement when you get to the end of it. So this might be a good moment to take a quick time out to answer a few FAQs about ocean rowing that might be going through your mind. Number one that I get asked  What do you eat  A few freeze dried meals  but mostly I try and eat much more unprocessed foods. So I grow my own beansprouts. I eat fruits and nut bars  a lot of nuts. And generally arrive about    pounds lighter at the other end. Question number two  How do you sleep  With my eyes shut. Ha ha. I suppose what you mean is  What happens to the boat while I'm sleeping  Well  I plan my route so that I'm drifting with the winds and the currents while I'm sleeping. On a good night  I think my best ever was    miles in the right direction. Worst ever     miles in the wrong direction. That's a bad day at the office. What do I wear  Mostly  a baseball cap  rowing gloves and a smile    or a frown  depending on whether I went backwards overnight    and lots of sun lotion. Do I have a chase boat  No I don't. I'm totally self supporting out there. I don't see anybody for the whole time that I'm at sea  generally. And finally  Am I crazy  Well  I leave that one up to you to judge. So  how do you top rowing across the Atlantic  Well  naturally  you decide to row across the Pacific. Well  I thought the Atlantic was big  but the Pacific is really  really big. I think we tend to do it a little bit of a disservice in our usual maps. I don't know for sure that the Brits invented this particular view of the world  but I suspect we might have done so  we are right in the middle  and we've cut the Pacific in half and flung it to the far corners of the world. Whereas if you look in Google Earth  this is how the Pacific looks. It pretty much covers half the planet. You can just see a little bit of North America up here and a sliver of Australia down there. It is really big       million square miles    and to row in a straight line across it would be about       miles. Unfortunately  ocean rowboats very rarely go in a straight line. By the time I get to Australia  if I get to Australia  I will have rowed probably nine or        miles in all. So  because nobody in their straight mind would row straight past Hawaii without dropping in  I decided to cut this very big undertaking into three segments. The first attempt didn't go so well. In       I did a rather involuntary capsize drill three times in    hours. A bit like being in a washing machine. Boat got a bit dinged up  so did I. I blogged about it. Unfortunately  somebody with a bit of a hero complex decided that this damsel was in distress and needed saving. The first I knew about this was when the Coast Guard plane turned up overhead. I tried to tell them to go away. We had a bit of a battle of wills. I lost and got airlifted. Awful  really awful. It was one of the worst feelings of my life  as I was lifted up on that winch line into the helicopter and looked down at my trusty little boat rolling around in the    foot waves and wondering if I would ever see her again. So I had to launch a very expensive salvage operation and then wait another nine months before I could get back out onto the ocean again. But what do you do  Fall down nine times  get up   . So  the following year  I set out and  fortunately  this time made it safely across to Hawaii. But it was not without misadventure. My watermaker broke  only the most important piece of kit that I have on the boat. Powered by my solar panels  it sucks in saltwater and turns it into freshwater. But it doesn't react very well to being immersed in ocean  which is what happened to it. Fortunately  help was at hand. There was another unusual boat out there at the same time  doing as I was doing  bringing awareness to the North Pacific Garbage Patch  that area in the North Pacific about twice the size of Texas  with an estimated  .  million tons of trash in it  circulating at the center of that North Pacific Gyre. So  to make the point  these guys had actually built their boat out of plastic trash         empty water bottles latched together into two pontoons. They were going very slowly. Partly  they'd had a bit of a delay. They'd had to pull in at Catalina Island shortly after they left Long Beach because the lids of all the water bottles were coming undone  and they were starting to sink. So they'd had to pull in and do all the lids up. But  as I was approaching the end of my water reserves  luckily  our courses were converging. They were running out of food  I was running out of water. So we liaised by satellite phone and arranged to meet up. And it took about a week for us to actually gradually converge. I was doing a pathetically slow speed of about  .  knots  and they were doing only marginally less pathetic speed of about  .   it was like two snails in a mating dance. But  eventually  we did manage to meet up and Joel hopped overboard  caught us a beautiful  big mahi mahi  which was the best food I'd had in  ooh  at least three months. Fortunately  the one that he caught that day was better than this one they caught a few weeks earlier. When they opened this one up  they found its stomach was full of plastic. And this is really bad news because plastic is not an inert substance. It leaches out chemicals into the flesh of the poor critter that ate it  and then we come along and eat that poor critter  and we get some of the toxins accumulating in our bodies as well. So there are very real implications for human health. I eventually made it to Hawaii still alive. And  the following year  set out on the second stage of the Pacific  from Hawaii down to Tarawa. And you'll notice something about Tarawa  it is very low lying. It's that little green sliver on the horizon  which makes them very nervous about rising oceans. This is big trouble for these guys. They've got no points of land more than about six feet above sea level. And also  as an increase in extreme weather events due to climate change  they're expecting more waves to come in over the fringing reef  which will contaminate their fresh water supply. I had a meeting with the president there  who told me about his exit strategy for his country. He expects that within the next    years  the         people that live there will have to relocate to New Zealand or Australia. And that made me think about how would I feel if Britain was going to disappear under the waves  if the places where I'd been born and gone to school and got married  if all those places were just going to disappear forever. How  literally  ungrounded that would make me feel. Very shortly  I'll be setting out to try and get to Australia  and if I'm successful  I'll be the first woman ever to row solo all the way across the Pacific. And I try to use this to bring awareness to these environmental issues  to bring a human face to the ocean. If the Atlantic was about my inner journey  discovering my own capabilities  maybe the Pacific has been about my outer journey  figuring out how I can use my interesting career choice to be of service to the world  and to take some of those things that I've learned out there and apply them to the situation that humankind now finds itself in. I think there are probably three key points here. The first one is about the stories that we tell ourselves. For so long  I told myself that I couldn't have an adventure because I wasn't six foot tall and athletic and bearded. And then that story changed. I found out that people had rowed across oceans. I even met one of them and she was just about my size. So even though I didn't grow any taller  I didn't sprout a beard  something had changed  My interior dialogue had changed. At the moment  the story that we collectively tell ourselves is that we need all this stuff  that we need oil. But what about if we just change that story  We do have alternatives  and we have the power of free will to choose those alternatives  those sustainable ones  to create a greener future. The second point is about the accumulation of tiny actions. We might think that anything that we do as an individual is just a drop in the ocean  that it can't really make a difference. But it does. Generally  we haven't got ourselves into this mess through big disasters. Yes  there have been the Exxon Valdezes and the Chernobyls  but mostly it's been an accumulation of bad decisions by billions of individuals  day after day and year after year. And  by the same token  we can turn that tide. We can start making better  wiser  more sustainable decisions. And when we do that  we're not just one person. Anything that we do spreads ripples. Other people will see if you're in the supermarket line and you pull out your reusable grocery bag. Maybe if we all start doing this  we can make it socially unacceptable to say yes to plastic in the checkout line. That's just one example. This is a world wide community. The other point  It's about taking responsibility. For so much of my life  I wanted something else to make me happy. I thought if I had the right house or the right car or the right man in my life  then I could be happy. But when I wrote that obituary exercise  I actually grew up a little bit in that moment and realized that I needed to create my own future. I couldn't just wait passively for happiness to come and find me. And I suppose I'm a selfish environmentalist. I plan on being around for a long time  and when I'm    years old  I want to be happy and healthy. And it's very difficult to be happy on a planet that's racked with famine and drought. It's very difficult to be healthy on a planet where we've poisoned the earth and the sea and the air. So  shortly  I'm going to be launching a new initiative called Eco Heroes. And the idea here is that all our Eco Heroes will log at least one green deed every day. It's meant to be a bit of a game. We're going to make an iPhone app out of it. We just want to try and create that awareness because  sure  changing a light bulb isn't going to change the world  but that attitude  that awareness that leads you to change the light bulb or take your reusable coffee mug  that is what could change the world. I really believe that we stand at a very important point in history. We have a choice. We've been blessed  or cursed  with free will. We can choose a greener future  and we can get there if we all pull together to take it one stroke at a time. Thank you. Most of the talks that you've heard in the last several fabulous days have been from people who have the characteristic that they have thought about something  they are experts  they know what's going on. All of you know about the topic that I'm supposed to talk about. That is  you know what simplicity is  you know what complexity is. The trouble is  I don't. And what I'm going to do is share with you my ignorance on this subject. I want you to read this  because we're going to come back to it in a moment. The quote is from the fabled Potter Stewart opinion on pornography. And let me just read it  the important details here   Shorthand description   'hardcore pornography'   and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly defining it. But I know it when I see it.  I'm going to come back to that in a moment. So  what is simplicity  It's good to start with some examples. A coffee cup    we don't think about coffee cups  but it's much more interesting than one might think    a coffee cup is a device  which has a container and a handle. The handle enables you to hold it when the container is filled with hot liquid. Why is that important  Well  it enables you to drink coffee. But also  by the way  the coffee is hot  the liquid is sterile  you're not likely to get cholera that way. So the coffee cup  or the cup with a handle  is one of the tools used by society to maintain public health. Scissors are your clothes  glasses enable you to see things and keep you from being eaten by cheetahs or run down by automobiles  and books are  after all  your education. But there's another class of simple things  which are also very important. Simple in function  but not at all simple in how they're constructed. And the two here are just examples. One is the cellphone  which we use every day. And it rests on a complexity  which has some characteristics very different from those that my friend Benoit Mandelbrot discussed  but are very interesting. And the other  of course  is a birth control pill  which  in a very simple way  fundamentally changed the structure of society by changing the role of women in it by providing to them the opportunity to make reproductive choices. So  there are two ways of thinking about this word  I think. And here I've corrupted the Potter Stewart quotation by saying that we can think about something    which spans all the way from scissors to the cell phone  Internet and birth control pills    by saying that they're simple  the functions are simple  and we recognize what that simplicity is when we see it. Or there may be another way of doing it  which is to think about the problem in terms of what    if you associate with moral philosophers    is called the teapot problem. The teapot problem I'll pose this way. Suppose you see a teapot  and the teapot is filled with hot water. And you then ask the question  Why is the water hot  And that's a simple question. It's like  what is simplicity  One answer would be  because the kinetic energy of the water molecules is high and they bounce against things rapidly    that's a kind of physical science argument. A second argument would be  because it was sitting on a stove with the flame on    that's an historical argument. A third is that I wanted hot water for tea    that's an intentional argument. And  since this is coming from a moral philosopher  the fourth would be that it's part of God's plan for the universe. All of these are possibilities. The point is that you get into trouble when you ask a single question with a single box for an answer  in which that single question actually is many questions with quite different meanings  but with the same words. Asking   What is simplicity   I think falls in that category. What is the state of science  And  interestingly  complexity is very highly evolved. We have a lot of interesting information about what complexity is. Simplicity  for reasons that are a little bit obscure  is almost not pursued  at least in the academic world. We academics    I am an academic    we love complexity. You can write papers about complexity  and the nice thing about complexity is it's fundamentally intractable in many ways  so you're not responsible for outcomes.  Laughter  Simplicity    all of you really would like your Waring Blender in the morning to make whatever a Waring Blender does  but not explode or play Beethoven. You're not interested in the limits of these things. So what one is interested in has a lot to do with the rewards of the system. And there's a lot of rewards in thinking about complexity and emergence  not so much in thinking about simplicity. One of the things I want to do is to help you with a very important task    which you may not know that you have very often    which is to understand how to sit next to a physicist at a dinner party and have a conversation.  Laughter  And the words that I would like you to focus on are complexity and emergence  because these will enable you to start the conversation and then daydream about other things. All right  what is complexity in this view of things  and what is emergence  We have  actually  a pretty good working definition of complexity. It is a system  like traffic  which has components. The components interact with one another. These are cars and drivers. They dissipate energy. It turns out that  whenever you have that system  weird stuff happens  and you in Los Angeles probably know this better than anyone. Here's another example  which I put up because it's an example of really important current science. You can't possibly read that. It's not intended that you read it  but that's a tiny part of the chemical reactions going on in each of your cells at any given moment. And it's like the traffic that you see. The amazing thing about the cell is that it actually does maintain a fairly stable working relationship with other cells  but we don't know why. Anyone who tells you that we understand life  walk away. And let me reduce this to the simplest level. We've heard from Bill Gates recently. All of us  to some extent  study this thing called a Bill Gates. Terrific. You learn everything you can about that. And then there's another kind of thing that you might study  and you study that hard. That's a Bono  this is a Bono. But then  if you know everything you can know about those two things  and you put them together  what can you say about this combination  The answer is  not a lot. And that's complexity. Now  imagine building that up to a city  or to a society  and you've got  obviously  an interesting problem. All right  so let me give you an example of simplicity of a particular kind. And I want to introduce a word that I think is very useful  which is stacking. And I'm going to use stacking for a kind of simplicity that has the characteristic that it is so simple and so reliable that I can build things with it. Or I'm going to use simple to mean reliable  predictable  repeatable. And I'm going to use as an example the Internet  because it's a particularly good example of stacked simplicity. We call it a complex system  which it is  but it's also something else. The Internet starts with mathematics  it starts with binary. And if you look at the list of things on the bottom  we are familiar with the Arabic numbers one to    and so on. In binary  one is       seven is     . The question is  Why is binary simpler than Arabic  And the answer is  simply  that if I hold up three fingers  you can count that easily  but if I hold up this  it's sort of hard to say that I just did seven. The virtue of binary is that it's the simplest possible way of representing numbers. Anything else is more complicated. You can catch errors with it  it's unambiguous in its reading  there are lots of good things about binary. So it is very  very simple once you learn how to read it. Now  if you like to represent this zero and one of binary  you need a device. And think of things in your life that are binary  one of them is light switches. They can be on and off. That's binary. Now wall switches  we all know  fail. But our friends who are condensed matter physicists managed to come up  some    years ago  with a very nice device  shown under that bell jar  which is a transistor. A transistor is nothing more than a wall switch. It turns things on and off  but it does so without moving parts and it doesn't fail  basically  for a very long period of time. So the second layer of simplicity was the transistor in the Internet. So  since the transistor is so simple  you can put lots of them together. And you put lots of them together and you come with something called integrated circuits. And a current integrated circuit might have in each one of these chips something like a billion transistors  all of which have to work perfectly every time. So that's the next layer of simplicity  and  in fact  integrated circuits are really simple in the sense that they  in general  work really well. With integrated circuits  you can build cellphones. You all are accustomed to having your cellphones work the large majority of the time. In Boston ... Boston is a little bit like Namibia in its cell phone coverage   Laughter  so that we're not accustomed to that all the time  but some of the time. But  in fact  if you have cell phones  you can now go to this nice lady who's somewhere like Namibia  and who is extremely happy with the fact that although she does not have an master's degree in electrical engineering from MIT  she's nonetheless able to hack her cell phone to get power in some funny way. And from that comes the Internet. And this is a map of bitflows across the continent. The two blobs that are light in the middle there are the United States and Europe. And then back to simplicity again. So here we have what I think is one of the great ideas  which is Google. Which  in this simple portal makes the claim that it makes accessible all of the world's information. But the point is that that extraordinary simple idea rests on layers of simplicity each compounded into a complexity that is itself simple  in the sense that it is completely reliable. All right  let me then finish off with four general statements  an example and two aphorisms. The characteristics  which I think are useful to think about for simple things  First  they are predictable. Their behavior is predictable. Now  one of the nice characteristics of simple things is you know what it's going to do  in general. So simplicity and predictability are characteristics of simple things. The second is  and this is a real world statement  they're cheap. If you have things that are cheap enough  people will find uses for them  even if they seem very primitive. So  for example  stones. You can build cathedrals out of stones  you just have to know what it does. You carve them in blocks and then you pile them on top of one another  and they support weight. So there has to be function  the function has to be predictable and the cost has to be low. What that means is that you have to have a high performance or value for cost. And then I would propose as this last component that they serve  or have the potential to serve  as building blocks. That is  you can stack them. And stack can mean this way  or it can mean this way  or it can mean in some arbitrary n dimensional space. But if you have something that has a function  and it's really cheap  people will find new ways of putting it together to make new things. Cheap  functional  reliable things unleash the creativity of people who then build stuff that you could not imagine. There's no way of predicting the Internet based on the first transistor. It just is not possible. So these are the components. Now  the example is something that I want to give you from the work that we ourselves do. We are very interested in delivering health care in the developing world  and one of the things that we wish to do in this particular business is to find a way of doing medical diagnosis at as close to zero cost as we can manage. So  how does one do that  This is a world in which there's no electricity  there's no money  there's no medical competence. And I don't want to spend your time in going through the details  but in the lower right hand corner  you see an example of the kind of thing that we have. It's a little paper chip. It has a few things printed on it using the same technology that you use for making comic books  which was the inspiration for this particular idea. And you put a drop  in this case  of urine at the bottom. It wicks its way up into these little branches. You know  no power required. It turns colors. In this particular case  you're reading kidney function. And  since the health care worker of much of this part of the world is an    year old with an AK     who happens to be out of work and is willing to go around and do this sort of thing  he can take a picture of it with his cellphone  send the picture back to where there is a doctor  and the doctor can look at it. So what you've done is to take a technology  which is available everywhere  make a device  which is extremely cheap  and make it in such a fashion that it is very  very reliable. If we can pull this off  if we can build more function  it will be stackable. That is to say  if we can make the basic technology of one or two things work  it will be applicable to a very  very large variety of human conditions  and hence  extendable in both vertical and horizontal directions. Part of my interest in this  I have to say  is that I would like to    how do I put this politely     change the way  or maybe eviscerate  the capital structure of the U.S. health care system  which I think is fundamentally broken. So  let me close    Let me close with my two aphorisms. One of them is from Mr. Einstein  and he says   Everything should be made as simple as possible  but not simpler.  And I think that's a very good way of thinking about the problem. If you take too much out of something that's simple  you lose function. You have to have low cost  but you also have to have a function. So you can't make it too simple. And the second is a design issue  and it's not directly relevant  but it's a nice statement. This is by de Saint Exupery. And he says   You know you've achieved perfection in design  not when you have nothing more to add  but when you have nothing more to take away.  And that certainly is going in the right direction. So  what I think one can begin to do with this kind of cut at the word simplicity  which doesn't cover Brancusi  it doesn't answer the question of why Mondrian is better or worse or simpler or less simpler than Van Gogh  and certainly doesn't address the question of whether Mozart is simpler than Bach. But it does make a point    which is one which  in a sense  differentiates the real world of people who make things  and the world of people who think about things  which is  there is an intellectual merit to asking  How do we make things as simple as we can  as cheap as we can  as functional as we can and as freely interconnectable as we can  If we make that kind of simplicity in our technology and then give it to you guys  you can go off and do all kinds of fabulous things with it. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Quick question. So can you picture that a science of simplicity might get to the point where you could look out at various systems    say a financial system or a legal system  health system    and say   That has got to the point of danger or dysfunctionality for the following reasons  and this is how we might simplify it   George Whitesides  Yes  I think you could. Because if you look at the components from which the system is made and examine their fragility  or their stability  you can probably build a kind of risk assessment based on that basis. CA  Have you started to do that  I mean  with the health system  you got a sort of radical solution on the cost side  but in terms of the system itself  GW  Well  no. How do I put that simply  No. CA  That was a simple  powerful answer. GW  Yes. CA  So  in terms of that diagnostic technology that you've got  where is that  and when do you see that maybe getting rolled out to scale. GW  That's coming out soon. I mean  the systems work  and we have to find out how to manufacture them and do things of this kind  but the basic technology works. CA  You've got a company set up to ... GW  A foundation  a foundation. Not for profit. CA  All right. Well  thank you so much for your talk. Thank you.  Applause  If you go on the TED website  you can currently find there over a full week of TEDTalk videos  over  .  million words of transcripts and millions of user ratings. And that's a huge amount of data. And it got me wondering  If you took all this data and put it through statistical analysis  could you reverse engineer a TEDTalk  Could you create the ultimate TEDTalk  And also  could you create the worst possible TEDTalk that they would still let you get away with  To find this out  I looked at three things  I looked at the topic that you should choose  I looked at how you should deliver it and the visuals onstage. Now  with the topic  There's a whole range of topics you can choose  but you should choose wisely  because your topic strongly correlates with how users will react to your talk. Now  to make this more concrete  let's look at the list of top    words that statistically stick out in the most favorite TEDTalks and in the least favorite TEDTalks. So if you came here to talk about how French coffee will spread happiness in our brains  that's a go. Whereas  if you wanted to talk about your project involving oxygen  girls  aircraft    actually  I would like to hear that talk   Laughter  but statistics say it's not so good. Oh  well. If you generalize this  the most favorite TEDTalks are those that feature topics we can connect with  both easily and deeply  such as happiness  our own body  food  emotions. And the more technical topics  such as architecture  materials and  strangely enough  men  those are not good topics to talk about. How should you deliver your talk  TED is famous for keeping a very sharp eye on the clock  so they're going to hate me for revealing this  because  actually  you should talk as long as they will let you.  Laughter  Because the most favorite TEDTalks are  on average  over    percent longer than the least favorite ones. And this holds true for all ranking lists on TED.com except if you want to have a talk that's beautiful  inspiring or funny. Then  you should be brief.  Laughter  But other than that  talk until they drag you off the stage. Now  while ... While you're pushing the clock  there's a few rules to obey. I found these rules out by comparing the statistics of four word phrases that appear more often in the most favorite TEDTalks as opposed to the least favorite TEDTalks. I'll give you three examples. First of all  I must  as a speaker  provide a service to the audience and talk about what I will give you  instead of saying what I can't have. Secondly  it's imperative that you do not cite The New York Times. And finally  it's okay for the speaker    that's the good news    to fake intellectual capacity. If I don't understand something  I can just say   etc.  etc.  You'll all stay with me. It's perfectly fine. Now  let's go to the visuals. The most obvious visual thing on stage is the speaker. And analysis shows if you want to be among the most favorite TED speakers  you should let your hair grow a little bit longer than average  make sure you wear your glasses and be slightly more dressed up than the average TED speaker. Slides are okay  though you might consider going for props. And now the most important thing  that is the mood onstage. Color plays a very important role. Color closely correlates with the ratings that talks get on the website. For example  fascinating talks contain a statistically high amount of exactly this blue color   Laughter  much more than the average TEDTalk. Ingenious TEDTalks  much more this green color  etc.  et. Now  personally  I think I'm not the first one who has done this analysis  but I'll leave this to your good judgment. So  now it's time to put it all together and design the ultimate TEDTalk. Now  since this is TEDActive  and I learned from my analysis that I should actually give you something  I will not impose the ultimate or worst TEDTalk on you  but rather give you a tool to create your own. And I call this tool the TEDPad. And the TEDPad is a matrix of     specifically selected  highly curated sentences that you can easily piece together to get your own TEDTalk. You only have to make one decision  and that is  Are you going to use the white version for very good TEDTalks  about creativity  human genius  Or are you going to go with a black version  which will allow you to create really bad TEDTalks  mostly about blogs  politics and stuff  So  download it and have fun with it. Now I hope you enjoy the session. I hope you enjoy designing your own ultimate and worst possible TEDTalks. And I hope some of you will be inspired for next year to create this  which I really want to see. Thank you very much. So here it is. You can check  I am short  I'm French  I have a pretty strong French accent  so that's going to be clear in a moment. Maybe a sobering thought and something you all know about. And I suspect many of you gave something to the people of Haiti this year. And there is something else I believe in the back of your mind you also know. That is  every day         children die of entirely preventable causes. That's a Haiti earthquake every eight days. And I suspect many of you probably gave something towards that problem as well  but somehow it doesn't happen with the same intensity. So why is that  Well  here is a thought experiment for you. Imagine you have a few million dollars that you've raised    maybe you're a politician in a developing country and you have a budget to spend. You want to spend it on the poor  How do you go about it  Do you believe the people who tell you that all we need to do is to spend money  That we know how to eradicate poverty  we just need to do more  Or do you believe the people who tell you that aid is not going to help  on the contrary it might hurt  it might exacerbate corruption  dependence  etc.  Or maybe you turn to the past. After all  we have spent billions of dollars on aid. Maybe you look at the past and see. Has it done any good  And  sadly  we don't know. And worst of all  we will never know. And the reason is that    take Africa for example. Africans have already got a lot of aid. These are the blue bars. And the GDP in Africa is not making much progress. Okay  fine. How do you know what would have happened without the aid  Maybe it would have been much worse  or maybe it would have been better. We have no idea. We don't know what the counterfactual is. There's only one Africa. So what do you do  To give the aid  and hope and pray that something comes out of it  Or do you focus on your everyday life and let the earthquake every eight days continue to happen  The thing is  if we don't know whether we are doing any good  we are not any better than the Medieval doctors and their leeches. Sometimes the patient gets better  sometimes the patient dies. Is it the leeches  Is it something else  We don't know. So here are some other questions. They're smaller questions  but they are not that small. Immunization  that's the cheapest way to save a child's life. And the world has spent a lot of money on it  The GAVI and the Gates Foundations are each pledging a lot of money towards it  and developing countries themselves have been doing a lot of effort. And yet  every year at least    million children do not get the immunization they should get. So this is what you call a  last mile problem.  The technology is there  the infrastructure is there  and yet it doesn't happen. So you have your million. How do you use your million to solve this last mile problem  And here's another question  Malaria. Malaria kills almost         people every year  most of them in Sub Saharan Africa  most of them under five. In fact  that is the leading cause of under five mortality. We already know how to kill malaria  but some people come to you and say   You have your millions. How about bed nets   Bed nets are very cheap. For    dollars  you can manufacture and ship an insecticide treated bed net and you can teach someone to use them. And  not only do they protect the people who sleep under them  but they have these great contagion benefits. If half of a community sleeps under a net  the other half also benefits because the contagion of the disease spread. And yet  only a quarter of kids at risk sleep under a net. Societies should be willing to go out and subsidize the net  give them for free  or  for that matter  pay people to use them because of those contagion benefits.  Not so fast   say other people.  If you give the nets for free  people are not going to value them. They're not going to use them  or at least they're not going to use them as bed nets  maybe as fishing nets.  So  what do you do  Do you give the nets for free to maximize coverage  or do you make people pay in order to make sure that they really value them  How do you know  And a third question  Education. Maybe that's the solution  maybe we should send kids to school. But how do you do that  Do you hire teachers  Do you build more schools  Do you provide school lunch  How do you know  So here is the thing. I cannot answer the big question  whether aid did any good or not. But these three questions  I can answer them. It's not the Middle Ages anymore  it's the   st century. And in the   th century  randomized  controlled trials have revolutionized medicine by allowing us to distinguish between drugs that work and drugs that don't work. And you can do the same randomized  controlled trial for social policy. You can put social innovation to the same rigorous  scientific tests that we use for drugs. And in this way  you can take the guesswork out of policy making by knowing what works  what doesn't work and why. And I'll give you some examples with those three questions. So I start with immunization. Here's Udaipur District  Rajasthan. Beautiful. Well  when I started working there  about one percent of children were fully immunized. That's bad  but there are places like that. Now  it's not because the vaccines are not there    they are there and they are free    and it's not because parents do not care about their kids. The same child that is not immunized against measles  if they do get measles  parents will spend thousands of rupees to help them. So you get these empty village subcenters and crowded hospitals. So what is the problem  Well  part of the problem  surely  is people do not fully understand. After all  in this country as well  all sorts of myths and misconceptions go around immunization. So if that's the case  that's difficult  because persuasion is really difficult. But maybe there is another problem as well. It's going from intention to action. Imagine you are a mother in Udaipur District  Rajasthan. You have to walk a few kilometers to get your kids immunized. And maybe when you get there  what you find is this  The subcenter is closed. Ao you have to come back  and you are so busy and you have so many other things to do  you will always tend to postpone and postpone  and eventually it gets too late. Well  if that's the problem  then that's much easier. Because A  we can make it easy  and B  we can maybe give people a reason to act today  rather than wait till tomorrow. So these are simple ideas  but we didn't know. So let's try them. So what we did is we did a randomized  controlled trial in     villages in Udaipur Districts. So the blue dots are selected randomly. We made it easy    I'll tell you how in a moment. In the red dots  we made it easy and gave people a reason to act now. The white dots are comparisons  nothing changed. So we make it easy by organizing this monthly camp where people can get their kids immunized. And then you make it easy and give a reason to act now by adding a kilo of lentils for each immunization. Now  a kilo of lentils is tiny. It's never going to convince anybody to do something that they don't want to do. On the other hand  if your problem is you tend to postpone  then it might give you a reason to act today rather than later. So what do we find  Well  beforehand  everything is the same. That's the beauty of randomization. Afterwards  the camp    just having the camp    increases immunization from six percent to    percent. That's full immunization. That's not bad  that's a good improvement. Add the lentils and you reach to    percent. So here you've got your answer. Make it easy and give a kilo of lentils  you multiply immunization rate by six. Now  you might say   Well  but it's not sustainable. We cannot keep giving lentils to people.  Well  it turns out it's wrong economics  because it is cheaper to give lentils than not to give them. Since you have to pay for the nurse anyway  the cost per immunization ends up being cheaper if you give incentives than if you don't. How about bed nets  Should you give them for free  or should you ask people to pay for them  So the answer hinges on the answer to three simple questions. One is  If people must pay for a bed net  are they going to purchase them  The second one is  If I give bed nets for free  are people going to use them  And the third one is  Do free bed nets discourage future purchase  The third one is important because if we think people get used to handouts  it might destroy markets to distribute free bed nets. Now this is a debate that has generated a lot of emotion and angry rhetoric. It's more ideological than practical  but it turns out it's an easy question. We can know the answer to this question. We can just run an experiment. And many experiments have been run  and they all have the same results  so I'm just going to talk to you about one. And this one that was in Kenya  they went around and distributed to people vouchers  discount vouchers. So people with their voucher could get the bed net in the local pharmacy. And some people get     percent discount  and some people get    percent discounts  and some people get    percent discount  etc. And now we can see what happens. So  how about the purchasing  Well  what you can see is that when people have to pay for their bed nets  the coverage rate really falls down a lot. So even with partial subsidy  three dollars is still not the full cost of a bed net  and now you only have    percent of the people with the bed nets  you lose the health immunity  that's not great. Second thing is  how about the use  Well  the good news is  people  if they have the bed nets  will use the bed nets regardless of how they got it. If they get it for free  they use it. If they have to pay for it  they use it. How about the long term  In the long term  people who got the free bed nets  one year later  were offered the option to purchase a bed net at two dollars. And people who got the free one were actually more likely to purchase the second one than people who didn't get a free one. So people do not get used to handouts  they get used to nets. Maybe we need to give them a little bit more credit. So  that's for bed nets. So you will think   That's great. You know how to immunize kids  you know how to give bed nets.  But what politicians need is a range of options. They need to know  Out of all the things I could do  what is the best way to achieve my goals  So suppose your goal is to get kids into school. There are so many things you could do. You could pay for uniforms  you could eliminate fees  you could build latrines  you could give girls sanitary pads  etc.  etc. So what's the best  Well  at some level  we think all of these things should work. So  is that sufficient  If we think they should work intuitively  should we go for them  Well  in business  that's certainly not the way we would go about it. Consider for example transporting goods. Before the canals were invented in Britain before the Industrial Revolution  goods used to go on horse carts. And then canals were built  and with the same horseman and the same horse  you could carry ten times as much cargo. So should they have continued to carry the goods on the horse carts  on the ground  that they would eventually get there  Well  if that had been the case  there would have been no Industrial Revolution. So why shouldn't we do the same with social policy  In technology  we spend so much time experimenting  fine tuning  getting the absolute cheapest way to do something  so why aren't we doing that with social policy  Well  with experiments  what you can do is answer a simple question. Suppose you have     dollars to spend on various interventions. How many extra years of education do you get for your hundred dollars  Now I'm going to show you what we get with various education interventions. So the first ones are if you want the usual suspects  hire teachers  school meals  school uniforms  scholarships. And that's not bad. For your hundred dollars  you get between one and three extra years of education. Things that don't work so well is bribing parents  just because so many kids are already going to school that you end up spending a lot of money. And here are the most surprising results. Tell people the benefits of education  that's very cheap to do. So for every hundred dollars you spend doing that  you get    extra years of education. And  in places where there are worms  intestinal worms  cure the kids of their worms. And for every hundred dollars  you get almost    extra years of education. So this is not your intuition  this is not what people would have gone for  and yet  these are the programs that work. We need that kind of information  we need more of it  and then we need to guide policy. So now  I started from the big problem  and I couldn't answer it. And I cut it into smaller questions  and I have the answer to these smaller questions. And they are good  scientific  robust answers. So let's go back to Haiti for a moment. In Haiti  about         people died    actually  a bit more by the latest estimate. And the response of the world was great  Two billion dollars got pledged just last month  so that's about        dollars per death. That doesn't sound like that much when you think about it. But if we were willing to spend        dollars for every child under five who dies  that would be    billion per year just for that problem. And yet it doesn't happen. So  why is that  Well  I think what part of the problem is that  in Haiti  although the problem is huge  somehow we understand it  it's localized. You give your money to Doctors Without Borders  you give your money to Partners In Health  and they'll send in the doctors  and they'll send in the lumber  and they'll helicopter things out and in. And the problem of poverty is not like that. So  first  it's mostly invisible  second  it's huge  and third  we don't know whether we are doing the right thing. There's no silver bullet. You cannot helicopter people out of poverty. And that's very frustrating. But look what we just did today. I gave you three simple answers to three questions  Give lentils to immunize people  provide free bed nets  deworm children. With immunization or bed nets  you can save a life for     dollars per life saved. With deworming  you can get an extra year of education for three dollars. So we cannot eradicate poverty just yet  but we can get started. And maybe we can get started small with things that we know are effective. Here's an example of how this can be powerful. Deworming. Worms have a little bit of a problem grabbing the headlines. They are not beautiful and don't kill anybody. And yet  when the young global leader in Davos showed the numbers I gave you  they started Deworm the World. And thanks to Deworm the World  and the effort of many country governments and foundations     million school aged children got dewormed in     . So this evidence is powerful. It can prompt action. So we should get started now. It's not going to be easy. It's a very slow process. You have to keep experimenting  and sometimes ideology has to be trumped by practicality. And sometimes what works somewhere doesn't work elsewhere. So it's a slow process  but there is no other way. These economics I'm proposing  it's like   th century medicine. It's a slow  deliberative process of discovery. There is no miracle cure  but modern medicine is saving millions of lives every year  and we can do the same thing. And now  maybe  we can go back to the bigger question that I started with at the beginning. I cannot tell you whether the aid we have spent in the past has made a difference  but can we come back here in    years and say   What we have done  it really prompted a change for the better.  I believe we can and I hope we will. Thank you. How do you explain when things don't go as we assume  Or better  how do you explain when others are able to achieve things that seem to defy all of the assumptions  For example  Why is Apple so innovative  Year after year  after year  they're more innovative than all their competition. And yet  they're just a computer company. They're just like everyone else. They have the same access to the same talent  the same agencies  the same consultants  the same media. Then why is it that they seem to have something different  Why is it that Martin Luther King led the Civil Rights Movement  He wasn't the only man who suffered in pre civil rights America  and he certainly wasn't the only great orator of the day. Why him  And why is it that the Wright brothers were able to figure out controlled  powered man flight when there were certainly other teams who were better qualified  better funded    and they didn't achieve powered man flight  and the Wright brothers beat them to it. There's something else at play here. About three and a half years ago  I made a discovery. And this discovery profoundly changed my view on how I thought the world worked  and it even profoundly changed the way in which I operate in it. As it turns out  there's a pattern. As it turns out  all the great inspiring leaders and organizations in the world  whether it's Apple or Martin Luther King or the Wright brothers  they all think  act and communicate the exact same way. And it's the complete opposite to everyone else. All I did was codify it  and it's probably the world's simplest idea. I call it the golden circle. Why  How  What  This little idea explains why some organizations and some leaders are able to inspire where others aren't. Let me define the terms really quickly. Every single person  every single organization on the planet knows what they do      percent. Some know how they do it  whether you call it your differentiated value proposition or your proprietary process or your USP. But very  very few people or organizations know why they do what they do. And by  why  I don't mean  to make a profit.  That's a result. It's always a result. By  why   I mean  What's your purpose  What's your cause  What's your belief  Why does your organization exist  Why do you get out of bed in the morning  And why should anyone care  As a result  the way we think  we act  the way we communicate is from the outside in  it's obvious. We go from the clearest thing to the fuzziest thing. But the inspired leaders and the inspired organizations    regardless of their size  regardless of their industry    all think  act and communicate from the inside out. Let me give you an example. I use Apple because they're easy to understand and everybody gets it. If Apple were like everyone else  a marketing message from them might sound like this   We make great computers. They're beautifully designed  simple to use and user friendly. Want to buy one    Meh.  That's how most of us communicate. That's how most marketing and sales are done  that's how we communicate interpersonally. We say what we do  we say how we're different or better and we expect some sort of a behavior  a purchase  a vote  something like that. Here's our new law firm  We have the best lawyers with the biggest clients  we always perform for our clients. Here's our new car  It gets great gas mileage  it has leather seats. Buy our car. But it's uninspiring. Here's how Apple actually communicates.  Everything we do  we believe in challenging the status quo. We believe in thinking differently. The way we challenge the status quo is by making our products beautifully designed  simple to use and user friendly. We just happen to make great computers. Want to buy one   Totally different  right  You're ready to buy a computer from me. I just reversed the order of the information. What it proves to us is that people don't buy what you do  people buy why you do it. This explains why every single person in this room is perfectly comfortable buying a computer from Apple. But we're also perfectly comfortable buying an MP  player from Apple  or a phone from Apple  or a DVR from Apple. As I said before  Apple's just a computer company. Nothing distinguishes them structurally from any of their competitors. Their competitors are equally qualified to make all of these products. In fact  they tried. A few years ago  Gateway came out with flat screen TVs. They're eminently qualified to make flat screen TVs. They've been making flat screen monitors for years. Nobody bought one. Dell came out with MP  players and PDAs  and they make great quality products  and they can make perfectly well designed products    and nobody bought one. In fact  talking about it now  we can't even imagine buying an MP  player from Dell. Why would you buy one from a computer company  But we do it every day. People don't buy what you do  they buy why you do it. The goal is not to do business with everybody who needs what you have. The goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe. Here's the best part  None of what I'm telling you is my opinion. It's all grounded in the tenets of biology. Not psychology  biology. If you look at a cross section of the human brain  from the top down  the human brain is actually broken into three major components that correlate perfectly with the golden circle. Our newest brain  our Homo sapien brain  our neocortex  corresponds with the  what  level. The neocortex is responsible for all of our rational and analytical thought and language. The middle two sections make up our limbic brains  and our limbic brains are responsible for all of our feelings  like trust and loyalty. It's also responsible for all human behavior  all decision making  and it has no capacity for language. In other words  when we communicate from the outside in  yes  people can understand vast amounts of complicated information like features and benefits and facts and figures. It just doesn't drive behavior. When we can communicate from the inside out  we're talking directly to the part of the brain that controls behavior  and then we allow people to rationalize it with the tangible things we say and do. This is where gut decisions come from. Sometimes you can give somebody all the facts and figures  and they say   I know what all the facts and details say  but it just doesn't feel right.  Why would we use that verb  it doesn't  feel  right  Because the part of the brain that controls decision making doesn't control language. The best we can muster up is   I don't know.  It just doesn't feel right.  Or sometimes you say you're leading with your heart or soul. I hate to break it to you  those aren't other body parts controlling your behavior. It's all happening here in your limbic brain  the part of the brain that controls decision making and not language. But if you don't know why you do what you do  and people respond to why you do what you do  then how will you ever get people to vote for you  or buy something from you  or  more importantly  be loyal and want to be a part of what it is that you do. The goal is not just to sell to people who need what you have  the goal is to sell to people who believe what you believe. The goal is not just to hire people who need a job  it's to hire people who believe what you believe. I always say that  you know  if you hire people just because they can do a job  they'll work for your money  but if they believe what you believe  they'll work for you with blood and sweat and tears. Nowhere else is there a better example than with the Wright brothers. Most people don't know about Samuel Pierpont Langley. And back in the early   th century  the pursuit of powered man flight was like the dot com of the day. Everybody was trying it. And Samuel Pierpont Langley had  what we assume  to be the recipe for success. Even now  you ask people   Why did your product or why did your company fail   and people always give you the same permutation of the same three things  under capitalized  the wrong people  bad market conditions. It's always the same three things  so let's explore that. Samuel Pierpont Langley was given        dollars by the War Department to figure out this flying machine. Money was no problem. He held a seat at Harvard and worked at the Smithsonian and was extremely well connected  he knew all the big minds of the day. He hired the best minds money could find and the market conditions were fantastic. The New York Times followed him around everywhere  and everyone was rooting for Langley. Then how come we've never heard of Samuel Pierpont Langley  A few hundred miles away in Dayton Ohio  Orville and Wilbur Wright  they had none of what we consider to be the recipe for success. They had no money  they paid for their dream with the proceeds from their bicycle shop  not a single person on the Wright brothers' team had a college education  not even Orville or Wilbur  and The New York Times followed them around nowhere. The difference was  Orville and Wilbur were driven by a cause  by a purpose  by a belief. They believed that if they could figure out this flying machine  it'll change the course of the world. Samuel Pierpont Langley was different. He wanted to be rich  and he wanted to be famous. He was in pursuit of the result. He was in pursuit of the riches. And lo and behold  look what happened. The people who believed in the Wright brothers' dream worked with them with blood and sweat and tears. The others just worked for the paycheck. They tell stories of how every time the Wright brothers went out  they would have to take five sets of parts  because that's how many times they would crash before supper. And  eventually  on December   th        the Wright brothers took flight  and no one was there to even experience it. We found out about it a few days later. And further proof that Langley was motivated by the wrong thing  The day the Wright brothers took flight  he quit. He could have said   That's an amazing discovery  guys  and I will improve upon your technology   but he didn't. He wasn't first  he didn't get rich  he didn't get famous  so he quit. People don't buy what you do  they buy why you do it. If you talk about what you believe  you will attract those who believe what you believe. But why is it important to attract those who believe what you believe  Something called the law of diffusion of innovation  if you don't know the law  you know the terminology. The first  .   of our population are our innovators. The next   .   of our population are our early adopters. The next     are your early majority  your late majority and your laggards. The only reason these people buy touch tone phones is because you can't buy rotary phones anymore. We all sit at various places at various times on this scale  but what the law of diffusion of innovation tells us is that if you want mass market success or mass market acceptance of an idea  you cannot have it until you achieve this tipping point between    and    percent market penetration  and then the system tips. I love asking businesses   What's your conversion on new business   They love to tell you   It's about    percent   proudly. Well  you can trip over     of the customers. We all have about     who just  get it.  That's how we describe them  right  That's like that gut feeling   Oh  they just get it.  The problem is  How do you find the ones that get it before doing business versus the ones who don't get it  So it's this here  this little gap that you have to close  as Jeffrey Moore calls it   Crossing the Chasm     because  you see  the early majority will not try something until someone else has tried it first. And these guys  the innovators and the early adopters  they're comfortable making those gut decisions. They're more comfortable making those intuitive decisions that are driven by what they believe about the world and not just what product is available. These are the people who stood in line for six hours to buy an iPhone when they first came out  when you could have bought one off the shelf the next week. These are the people who spent        dollars on flat screen TVs when they first came out  even though the technology was substandard. And  by the way  they didn't do it because the technology was so great  they did it for themselves. It's because they wanted to be first. People don't buy what you do  they buy why you do it and what you do simply proves what you believe. In fact  people will do the things that prove what they believe. The reason that person bought the iPhone in the first six hours  stood in line for six hours  was because of what they believed about the world  and how they wanted everybody to see them  They were first. People don't buy what you do  they buy why you do it. So let me give you a famous example  a famous failure and a famous success of the law of diffusion of innovation. First  the famous failure. It's a commercial example. As we said before  the recipe for success is money and the right people and the right market conditions. You should have success then. Look at TiVo. From the time TiVo came out about eight or nine years ago to this current day  they are the single highest quality product on the market  hands down  there is no dispute. They were extremely well funded. Market conditions were fantastic. I mean  we use TiVo as verb. I TiVo stuff on my piece of junk Time Warner DVR all the time. But TiVo's a commercial failure. They've never made money. And when they went IPO  their stock was at about    or    dollars and then plummeted  and it's never traded above   . In fact  I don't think it's even traded above six  except for a couple of little spikes. Because you see  when TiVo launched their product  they told us all what they had. They said   We have a product that pauses live TV  skips commercials  rewinds live TV and memorizes your viewing habits without you even asking.  And the cynical majority said   We don't believe you. We don't need it. We don't like it. You're scaring us.  What if they had said   If you're the kind of person who likes to have total control over every aspect of your life  boy  do we have a product for you. It pauses live TV  skips commercials  memorizes your viewing habits  etc.  etc.  People don't buy what you do  they buy why you do it  and what you do simply serves as the proof of what you believe. Now let me give you a successful example of the law of diffusion of innovation. In the summer of               people showed up on the mall in Washington to hear Dr. King speak. They sent out no invitations  and there was no website to check the date. How do you do that  Well  Dr. King wasn't the only man in America who was a great orator. He wasn't the only man in America who suffered in a pre civil rights America. In fact  some of his ideas were bad. But he had a gift. He didn't go around telling people what needed to change in America. He went around and told people what he believed.  I believe  I believe  I believe   he told people. And people who believed what he believed took his cause  and they made it their own  and they told people. And some of those people created structures to get the word out to even more people. And lo and behold          people showed up on the right day at the right time to hear him speak. How many of them showed up for him  Zero. They showed up for themselves. It's what they believed about America that got them to travel in a bus for eight hours to stand in the sun in Washington in the middle of August. It's what they believed  and it wasn't about black versus white      of the audience was white. Dr. King believed that there are two types of laws in this world  those that are made by a higher authority and those that are made by men. And not until all the laws that are made by men are consistent with the laws made by the higher authority will we live in a just world. It just so happened that the Civil Rights Movement was the perfect thing to help him bring his cause to life. We followed  not for him  but for ourselves. By the way  he gave the  I have a dream  speech  not the  I have a plan  speech. Listen to politicians now  with their comprehensive    point plans. They're not inspiring anybody. Because there are leaders and there are those who lead. Leaders hold a position of power or authority  but those who lead inspire us. Whether they're individuals or organizations  we follow those who lead  not because we have to  but because we want to. We follow those who lead  not for them  but for ourselves. And it's those who start with  why  that have the ability to inspire those around them or find others who inspire them. Thank you very much. I'm an ecologist  mostly a coral reef ecologist. I started out in Chesapeake Bay and went diving in the winter and became a tropical ecologist overnight. And it was really a lot of fun for about    years. I mean  somebody pays you to go around and travel and look at some of the most beautiful places on the planet. And that was what I did. And I ended up in Jamaica  in the West Indies  where the coral reefs were really among the most extraordinary  structurally  that I ever saw in my life. And this picture here  it's really interesting  it shows two things  First of all  it's in black and white because the water was so clear and you could see so far  and film was so slow in the     s and early   s  you took pictures in black and white. The other thing it shows you is that  although there's this beautiful forest of coral  there are no fish in that picture. Those reefs at Discovery Bay  Jamaica were the most studied coral reefs in the world for    years. We were the best and the brightest. People came to study our reefs from Australia  which is sort of funny because now we go to theirs. And the view of scientists about how coral reefs work  how they ought to be  was based on these reefs without any fish. Then  in       there was a hurricane  Hurricane Allen. I put half the lab up in my house. The wind blew very strong. The waves were    to    feet high. And the reefs disappeared  and new islands formed  and we thought   Well  we're real smart. We know that hurricanes have always happened in the past.  And we published a paper in Science  the first time that anybody ever described the destruction on a coral reef by a major hurricane. And we predicted what would happen  and we got it all wrong. And the reason was because of overfishing  and the fact that a last common grazer  a sea urchin  died. And within a few months after that sea urchin dying  the seaweed started to grow. And that is the same reef  that's the same reef    years ago  that's the same reef today. The coral reefs of the north coast of Jamaica have a few percent live coral cover and a lot of seaweed and slime. And that's more or less the story of the coral reefs of the Caribbean  and increasingly  tragically  the coral reefs worldwide. Now  that's my little  depressing story. All of us in our   s and   s have comparable depressing stories. There are tens of thousands of those stories out there  and it's really hard to conjure up much of a sense of well being  because it just keeps getting worse. And the reason it keeps getting worse is that after a natural catastrophe  like a hurricane  it used to be that there was some kind of successional sequence of recovery  but what's going on now is that overfishing and pollution and climate change are all interacting in a way that prevents that. And so I'm going to sort of go through and talk about those three kinds of things. We hear a lot about the collapse of cod. It's difficult to imagine that two  or some historians would say three world wars were fought during the colonial era for the control of cod. Cod fed most of the people of Western Europe. It fed the slaves brought to the Antilles  the song  Jamaica Farewell      Ackee rice salt fish are nice     is an emblem of the importance of salt cod from northeastern Canada. It all collapsed in the   s and the   s         people lost their jobs. And that was the beginning of a kind of serial depletion from bigger and tastier species to smaller and not so tasty species  from species that were near to home to species that were all around the world  and what have you. It's a little hard to understand that  because you can go to a Costco in the United States and buy cheap fish. You ought to read the label to find out where it came from  but it's still cheap  and everybody thinks it's okay. It's hard to communicate this  and one way that I think is really interesting is to talk about sport fish  because people like to go out and catch fish. It's one of those things. This picture here shows the trophy fish  the biggest fish caught by people who pay a lot of money to get on a boat  go to a place off of Key West in Florida  drink a lot of beer  throw a lot of hooks and lines into the water  come back with the biggest and the best fish  and the champion trophy fish are put on this board  where people take a picture  and this guy is obviously really excited about that fish. Well  that's what it's like now  but this is what it was like in the     s from the same boat in the same place on the same board on the same dock. The trophy fish were so big that you couldn't put any of those small fish up on it. And the average size trophy fish weighed     to     pounds  goliath grouper  and if you wanted to go out and kill something  you could pretty much count on being able to catch one of those fish. And they tasted really good. And people paid less in      dollars to catch that than what people pay now to catch those little  tiny fish. And that's everywhere. It's not just the fish  though  that are disappearing. Industrial fishing uses big stuff  big machinery. We use nets that are    miles long. We use longlines that have one million or two million hooks. And we trawl  which means to take something the size of a tractor trailer truck that weighs thousands and thousands of pounds  put it on a big chain  and drag it across the sea floor to stir up the bottom and catch the fish. Think of it as being kind of the bulldozing of a city or of a forest  because it clears it away. And the habitat destruction is unbelievable. This is a photograph  a typical photograph  of what the continental shelves of the world look like. You can see the rows in the bottom  the way you can see the rows in a field that has just been plowed to plant corn. What that was  was a forest of sponges and coral  which is a critical habitat for the development of fish. What it is now is mud  and the area of the ocean floor that has been transformed from forest to level mud  to parking lot  is equivalent to the entire area of all the forests that have ever been cut down on all of the earth in the history of humanity. We've managed to do that in the last     to     years. We tend to think of oil spills and mercury and we hear a lot about plastic these days. And all of that stuff is really disgusting  but what's really insidious is the biological pollution that happens because of the magnitude of the shifts that it causes to entire ecosystems. And I'm going to just talk very briefly about two kinds of biological pollution  one is introduced species and the other is what comes from nutrients. So this is the infamous Caulerpa taxifolia  the so called killer algae. A book was written about it. It's a bit of an embarrassment. It was accidentally released from the aquarium in Monaco  it was bred to be cold tolerant to have in peoples aquaria. It's very pretty  and it has rapidly started to overgrow the once very rich biodiversity of the northwestern Mediterranean. I don't know how many of you remember the movie  The Little Shop of Horrors   but this is the plant of  The Little Shop of Horrors.  But  instead of devouring the people in the shop  what it's doing is overgrowing and smothering virtually all of the bottom dwelling life of the entire northwestern Mediterranean Sea. We don't know anything that eats it  we're trying to do all sorts of genetics and figure out something that could be done  but  as it stands  it's the monster from hell  about which nobody knows what to do. Now another form of pollution that's biological pollution is what happens from excess nutrients. The green revolution  all of this artificial nitrogen fertilizer  we use too much of it. It's subsidized  which is one of the reasons we used too much of it. It runs down the rivers  and it feeds the plankton  the little microscopic plant cells in the coastal water. But since we ate all the oysters and we ate all the fish that would eat the plankton  there's nothing to eat the plankton and there's more and more of it  so it dies of old age  which is unheard of for plankton. And when it dies  it falls to the bottom and then it rots  which means that bacteria break it down. And in the process they use up all the oxygen  and in using up all the oxygen they make the environment utterly lethal for anything that can't swim away. So  what we end up with is a microbial zoo dominated by bacteria and jellyfish  as you see on the left in front of you. And the only fishery left    and it is a commercial fishery    is the jellyfish fishery you see on the right  where there used to be prawns. Even in Newfoundland where we used to catch cod  we now have a jellyfish fishery. And another version of this sort of thing is what is often called red tides or toxic blooms. That picture on the left is just staggering to me. I have talked about it a million times  but it's unbelievable. In the upper right of that picture on the left is almost the Mississippi Delta  and the lower left of that picture is the Texas Mexico border. You're looking at the entire northwestern Gulf of Mexico  you're looking at one toxic dinoflagellate bloom that can kill fish  made by that beautiful little creature on the lower right. And in the upper right you see this black sort of cloud moving ashore. That's the same species. And as it comes to shore and the wind blows  and little droplets of the water get into the air  the emergency rooms of all the hospitals fill up with people with acute respiratory distress. And that's retirement homes on the west coast of Florida. A friend and I did this thing in Hollywood we called Hollywood ocean night  and I was trying to figure out how to explain to actors what's going on. And I said   So  imagine you're in a movie called 'Escape from Malibu' because all the beautiful people have moved to North Dakota  where it's clean and safe. And the only people who are left there are the people who can't afford to move away from the coast  because the coast  instead of being paradise  is harmful to your health.  And then this is amazing. It was when I was on holiday last early autumn in France. This is from the coast of Brittany  which is being enveloped in this green  algal slime. The reason that it attracted so much attention  besides the fact that it's disgusting  is that sea birds flying over it are asphyxiated by the smell and die  and a farmer died of it  and you can imagine the scandal that happened. And so there's this war between the farmers and the fishermen about it all  and the net result is that the beaches of Brittany have to be bulldozed of this stuff on a regular basis. And then  of course  there's climate change  and we all know about climate change. I guess the iconic figure of it is the melting of the ice in the Arctic Sea. Think about the thousands and thousands of people who died trying to find the Northwest Passage. Well  the Northwest Passage is already there. I think it's sort of funny  it's on the Siberian coast  maybe the Russians will charge tolls. The governments of the world are taking this really seriously. The military of the Arctic nations is taking it really seriously. For all the denial of climate change by government leaders  the CIA and the navies of Norway and the U.S. and Canada  whatever are busily thinking about how they will secure their territory in this inevitability from their point of view. And  of course  Arctic communities are toast. The other kinds of effects of climate change    this is coral bleaching. It's a beautiful picture  right  All that white coral. Except it's supposed to be brown. What happens is that the corals are a symbiosis  and they have these little algal cells that live inside them. And the algae give the corals sugar  and the corals give the algae nutrients and protection. But when it gets too hot  the algae can't make the sugar. The corals say   You cheated. You didn't pay your rent.  They kick them out  and then they die. Not all of them die  some of them survive  some more are surviving  but it's really bad news. To try and give you a sense of this  imagine you go camping in July somewhere in Europe or in North America  and you wake up the next morning  and you look around you  and you see that    percent of the trees  as far as you can see  have dropped their leaves and are standing there naked. And you come home  and you discover that    percent of all the trees in North America and in Europe have dropped their leaves. And then you read in the paper a few weeks later   Oh  by the way  a quarter of those died.  Well  that's what happened in the Indian Ocean during the      El Nino  an area vastly greater than the size of North America and Europe  when    percent of all the corals bleached and a quarter of them died. And then the really scary thing about all of this    the overfishing  the pollution and the climate change    is that each thing doesn't happen in a vacuum. But there are these  what we call  positive feedbacks  the synergies among them that make the whole vastly greater than the sum of the parts. And the great scientific challenge for people like me in thinking about all this  is do we know how to put Humpty Dumpty back together again  I mean  because we  at this point  we can protect it. But what does that mean  We really don't know. So what are the oceans going to be like in    or    years  Well  there won't be any fish except for minnows  and the water will be pretty dirty  and all those kinds of things and full of mercury  etc.  etc. And dead zones will get bigger and bigger and they'll start to merge  and we can imagine something like the dead zonification of the global  coastal ocean. Then you sure won't want to eat fish that were raised in it  because it would be a kind of gastronomic Russian roulette. Sometimes you have a toxic bloom  sometimes you don't. That doesn't sell. The really scary things though are the physical  chemical  oceanographic things that are happening. As the surface of the ocean gets warmer  the water is lighter when it's warmer  it becomes harder and harder to turn the ocean over. We say it becomes more strongly stratified. The consequence of that is that all those nutrients that fuel the great anchoveta fisheries  of the sardines of California or in Peru or whatever  those slow down and those fisheries collapse. And  at the same time  water from the surface  which is rich in oxygen  doesn't make it down and the ocean turns into a desert. So the question is  How are we all going to respond to this  And we can do all sorts of things to fix it  but in the final analysis  the thing we really need to fix is ourselves. It's not about the fish  it's not about the pollution  it's not about the climate change. It's about us and our greed and our need for growth and our inability to imagine a world that is different from the selfish world we live in today. So the question is  Will we respond to this or not  I would say that the future of life and the dignity of human beings depends on our doing that. Thank you.  Applause  I bring to you a message from tens of thousands of people    in the villages  in the slums  in the hinterland of the country    who have solved problems through their own genius  without any outside help. When our home minister announces a few weeks ago a war on one third of India  about     districts that he mentioned were ungovernable  he missed the point. The point that we have been stressing for the last    years  the point that people may be economically poor  but they're not poor in the mind. In other words  the minds on the margin are not the marginal minds. That is the message  which we started    years ago. And what did it start  Let me just tell you  briefly  my personal journey  which led me to come to this point. In '    '    I was in Bangladesh advising the government and the research council there how to help scientists work on the lands  on the fields of the poor people  and how to develop research technologies  which are based on the knowledge of the people. I came back in '  . I had been tremendously invigorated by the knowledge and creativity that I found in that country  which had    percent landlessness but amazing creativity. I started looking at my own work  The work that I had done for the previous    years  almost every time  had instances of knowledge that people had shared. Now  I was paid in dollars as a consultant  and I looked at my income tax return and tried to ask myself   Is there a line in my return  which shows how much of this income has gone to the people whose knowledge has made it possible  Was it because I'm brilliant that I'm getting this reward  or because of the revolution  Is it that I write very well  Is it that I articulate very well  Is it that I analyze the data very well  Is it because I'm a professor  and  therefore  I must be entitled to this reward from society   I tried to convince myself that   No  no  I have worked for the policy changes. You know  the public policy will become more responsive to the needs of the poor  and  therefore I think it's okay.  But it appeared to me that all these years that I'd been working on exploitation    exploitation by landlords  by moneylenders  by traders    gave me an insight that probably I was also an exploiter  because there was no line in my income tax return which showed this income accrued because of the brilliance of the people    those people who have shared their knowledge and good faith and trust with me    and nothing ever went back to them. So much so  that much of my work till that time was in the English language. The majority of the people from whom I learned didn't know English. So what kind of a contributor was I  I was talking about social justice  and here I was  a professional who was pursuing the most unjust act    of taking knowledge from the people  making them anonymous  getting rent from that knowledge by sharing it and doing consultancy  writing papers and publishing them in the papers  getting invited to the conferences  getting consultancies and whatever have you. So then  a dilemma rose in the mind that  if I'm also an exploiter  then this is not right  life cannot go on like that. And this was a moment of great pain and trauma because I couldn't live with it any longer. So I did a review of ethical dilemma and value conflicts and management research  wrote  read about     papers. And I came to the conclusion that while dilemma is unique  dilemma is not unique  the solution had to be unique. And one day    I don't know what happened    while coming back from the office towards home  maybe I saw a honey bee or it occurred to my mind that if I only could be like the honey bee  life would be wonderful. What the honey bee does  it pollinates  takes nectar from the flower  pollinates another flower  cross pollinates. And when it takes the nectar  the flowers don't feel shortchanged. In fact  they invite the honey bees through their colors  and the bees don't keep all the honey for themselves. These are the three guiding principles of the Honey Bee Network  that whenever we learn something from people it must be shared with them in their language. They must not remain anonymous. And I must tell you that after    years  I have not made one percent of change in the professional practice of this art. That is a great tragedy    which I'm carrying still with me and I hope that all of you will carry this with you    that the profession still legitimizes publication of knowledge of people without attributing them by making them anonymous. The research guidelines of U.S. National Academy of Sciences or Research Councils of the U.K. or of Indian Councils of Science Research do not require that whatever you learn from people  you must share back with them. We are talking about an accountable society  a society that is fair and just  and we don't even do justice in the knowledge market. And India wants to be a knowledge society. How will it be a knowledge society  So  obviously  you cannot have two principles of justice  one for yourself and one for others. It must be the same. You cannot discriminate. You cannot be in favor of your own values  which are at a distance from the values that you espouse. So  fairness to one and to the other is not divisible. Look at this picture. Can you tell me where has it been taken from  and what is it meant for  Anybody  I'm a professor  I must quiz you.  Laughter  Anybody  Any guess at all  Pardon   Audience Member  Rajasthan.  Anil Gupta  But what has it been used for  What has it been used for  Pardon  You know  you're so right. We must give him a hand  because this man knows how insensitive our government is. Look at this. This is the site of the government of India. It invites tourists to see the shame of our country. I'm so sorry to say that. Is this a beautiful picture or is it a terrible picture  It depends upon how you look at the life of the people. If this woman has to carry water on her head for miles and miles and miles  you cannot be celebrating that. We should be doing something about it. And let me tell you  with all the science and technology at our command  millions of women still carry water on their heads. And we do not ask this question. You must have taken tea in the morning. Think for a minute. The leaves of the tea  plucked from the bushes  you know what the action is  The action is  The lady picks up a few leaves  puts them in the basket on the backside. Just do it    times  you will realize the pain in this shoulder. And she does it a few thousand times every day. The rice that you ate in the lunch  and you will eat today  is transplanted by women bending in a very awkward posture  millions of them  every season  in the paddy season  when they transplant paddy with their feet in the water. And feet in the water will develop fungus  infections  and that infection pains because then other insects bite that point. And every year    .  percent of the paddy is transplanted manually. No machines have been developed. So the silence of scientists  of technologists  of public policy makers  of the change agent  drew our attention that this is not on  this is not on  this is not the way society will work. This is not what our parliament would do. You know  we have a program for employment  One hundred      million people have to be given jobs for     days by this great country. Doing what  Breaking stones  digging earth. So we asked a question to the parliament  Do poor have heads  Do poor have legs  mouth and hands  but no head  So Honey Bee Network builds upon the resource in which poor people are rich. And what has happened  An anonymous  faceless  nameless person gets in contact with the network  and then gets an identity. This is what Honey Bee Network is about. And this network grew voluntarily  continues to be voluntary  and has tried to map the minds of millions of people of our country and other parts of the world who are creative. They could be creative in terms of education  they may be creative in terms of culture  they may be creative in terms of institutions  but a lot of our work is in the field of technological creativity  the innovations  either in terms of contemporary innovations  or in terms of traditional knowledge. And it all begins with curiosity. It all begins with curiosity. This person  whom we met    and you will see it on the website  www.sristi.org    this tribal person  he had a wish. And he said   If my wish gets fulfilled     somebody was sick and he had to monitor     God  please cure him. And if you cure him  I will get my wall painted.  And this is what he got painted. Somebody was talking yesterday about Maslowian hierarchy. There could be nothing more wrong than the Maslowian model of hierarchy of needs because the poorest people in this country can get enlightenment. Kabir  Rahim  all the great Sufi saints  they were all poor people  and they had a great reason.  Applause  Please do not ever think that only after meeting your physiological needs and other needs can you be thinking about your spiritual needs or your enlightenment. Any person anywhere is capable of rising to that highest point of attainment  only by the resolve that they have in their mind that they must achieve something. Look at this. We saw it in Shodh Yatra. Every six months we walk in different parts of the country. I've walked about       kilometers in the last    years. So on the wayside we found these dung cakes  which are used as a fuel. Now  this lady  on the wall of the dung cake heap  has made a painting. That's the only space she could express her creativity. And she's so marvelous. Look at this lady  Ram Timari Devi  on a grain bin. In Champaran  we had a Shodh Yatra and we were walking in the land where Gandhiji went to hear about the tragedy  pain of indigo growers. Bhabi Mahato in Purulia and Bankura. Look at what she has done. The whole wall is her canvas. She's sitting there with a broom. Is she an artisan or an artist  Obviously she's an artist  she's a creative person. If we can create markets for these artists  we will not have to employ them for digging earth and breaking stones. They will be paid for what they are good at  not what they're bad at. Look at what Rojadeen has done. In Motihari in Champaran  there are a lot of people who sell tea on the shack and  obviously  there's a limited market for tea. Every morning you have tea  as well as coffee. So he thought  why don't I convert a pressure cooker into a coffee machine  So this is a coffee machine. Just takes a few hundred rupees. People bring their own cooker  he attaches a valve and a steam pipe  and now he gives you espresso coffee.  Laughter  Now  this is a real  affordable coffee percolator that works on gas. Look at what Sheikh Jahangir has done. A lot of poor people do not have enough grains to get ground. So this fellow is bringing a flour grinding machine on a two wheeler. If you have     grams        one kilogram  he will grind it for it for you  the flourmill will not grind such a small quantity. Please understand the problem of poor people. They have needs which have to be met efficiently in terms of energy  in terms of cost  in terms of quality. They don't want second standard  second quality outputs. But to be able to give them high quality output you need to adapt technology to their needs. And that is what Sheikh Jahangir did. But that's not enough  what he did. Look at what he did here. If you have clothes  and you don't have enough time to wash them  he brought a washing machine to your doorstep  mounted on a two wheeler. So here's a model where a two wheeler washing machine ... He is washing your clothes and drying them at your doorstep. You bring your water  you bring your soap  I wash the clothes for you. Charge    paisa  one rupee for you per lot  and a new business model can emerge. Now  what we need is  we need people who will be able to scale them up. Look at this. It looks like a beautiful photograph. But you know what it is  Can anybody guess what it is  Somebody from India would know  of course. It's a tawa. It's a hot plate made of clay. Now  what is the beauty in it  When you have a non stick pan  it costs about  maybe      rupees  five dollars  six dollars. This is less than a dollar and this is non stick  it is coated with one of these food grade materials. And the best part is that  while you use a costly non stick pan  you eat the so called Teflon or Teflon like material because after some time the stuff disappears. Where has it gone  It has gone in your stomach. It was not meant for that.  Laughter  You know  But here in this clay hot plate  it will never go into your stomach. So it is better  it is safer  it is affordable  it is energy efficient. In other words  solutions by the poor people need not be cheaper  need not be  so called  jugaad  need not be some kind of makeshift arrangement. They have to be better  they have to be more efficient  they have to be affordable. And that is what Mansukh Bhai Prajapati has done. He has designed this plate with a handle. And now with one dollar  you can afford a better alternative than the people market is offering you. This lady  she developed a herbal pesticide formulation. We filed the patent for her  the National Innovation Foundation. And who knows  Somebody will license this technology and develop marketable products  and she would get revenue. Now  let me mention one thing  I think we need a polycentric model of development  where a large number of initiatives in different parts of the country  in different parts of the world  would solve the needs of locality in a very efficient and adaptive manner. Higher the local fit  greater is the chance of scaling up. In the scaling up  there's an inherent inadequacy to match the needs of the local people  point by point  with the supply that you're making. So why are people willing to adjust with that mismatch  Things can scale up  and they have scaled up. For example  cell phones  We have     million cellphones in this country. Now  it is possible that I use only two buttons on the cellphone  only three options on the cellphone. It has     options  I'm paying for      I'm using only three but I'm willing to live with it  therefore it is scaling up. But if I had to get a match to match  obviously  I would need a different design of a cellphone. So what we're saying is that scalability should not become an enemy of sustainability. There must be a place in the world for solutions that are only relevant for a locality  and yet  one can be able to fund them. One of the greatest studies that we've been finding is that many times investors would ask this question     What is a scalable model      as if the need of a community  which is only located in a space and time and has those needs only located in those places  has no legitimate right to get them for free because it's not part of a larger scale. So either you sub optimize your needs to a larger scale or else you remain out. Now  the eminent model  the long tail model tells you that small sales of a large number of books  for example  having only a few copies sold can still be a viable model. And we must find a mechanism where people will pool in the portfolio  will invest in the portfolio  where different innovations will go to a small number of people in their localities  and yet  the overall platform of the model will become viable. Look at what he is doing. Saidullah Sahib is an amazing man. At the age of     he is linking up something very creative. Saidullah Sahib  I couldn't wait for the boat. I had to meet my love. My desperation made me an innovator. Even love needs help from technology. Innovation is the light of my wife  Noor. New inventions are the passion of my life. My technology. AG  Saidulluh Sahib is in Motihari  again in Champaran. Wonderful human being  but he stills sells  at this age  honey on a cycle to earn his livelihood  because we haven't been able to convince the water park people  the lake people  in  unclear  operations. And we have not been able to convince the fire brigade people in Mumbai    where there was a flood a few years ago and people had to walk    kilometers  wading in the water    that  look  you should have this cycle in your fire brigade office because you can then go to those lanes where your buses will not go  where your transport will not go. So we have not yet cracked the problem of making it available as a rescue device  as a vending device during the floods in eastern India  when you have to deliver things to people in different islands where they're marooned. But the idea has a merit. The idea has a merit. What has Appachan done  Appachan  unfortunately  is no more  but he has left behind a message. A very powerful message Appachan  I watch the world wake up every day. It's not that a coconut fell on my head  and I came upon this idea. With no money to fund my studies  I scaled new heights. Now  they call me the local Spiderman. My technology. AG  Many of you might not realize and believe that we have sold this product internationally    what I call a G G model  grassroots to global. And a professor in the University of Massachusetts  in the zoology department  bought this climber because she wanted to study the insect diversity of the top of the tree canopy. And this device makes it possible for her to take samples from a larger number of palms  rather than only a few  because otherwise she had to make a big platform and then climb her  unclear  would climb on that. So  you know  we are advancing the frontiers of science. Remya Jose has developed ... you can go to the YouTube and find India Innovates and then you will find these videos. Innovation by her when she was in class   th  a washing machine cum exercising machine. Mr. Kharai who is a physically challenged person  one and a half foot height  only. But he has modified a two wheeler so that he can get autonomy and freedom and flexibility. This innovation is from the slums of Rio. And this person  Mr. Ubirajara. We were talking about  my friends in Brazil  how we scale up this model in China and Brazil. And we have a very vibrant network in China  particularly  but also emerging in Brazil and other parts of the world. This stand on the front wheel  you will not find on any cycle. India and China have the largest number of cycles. But this innovation emerged in Brazil. The point is  none of us should be parochial  none of us should be so nationalistic to believe that all good ideas will come only from our country. No  we have to have the humility to learn from knowledge of economically poor people  wherever they are. And look at this whole range of cycle based innovations  cycle that's a sprayer  cycle that generates energy from the shocks on the road. I can't change the condition of the road  but I can make the cycle run faster. That is what Kanak Das has done. And in South Africa  we had taken our innovators  and many of us had gone there share with the colleagues in South Africa as to how innovation can become a means of liberation from the drudgery that people have. And this is a donkey cart which they modified. There's an axle here  of        kg  serving no purpose. Remove it  the cart needs one donkey less. This is in China. This girl needed a breathing apparatus. These three people in the village sat down and decided to think   How do we elongate the life of this girl of our village   They were not related to her  but they tried to find out   How can we use ...   They used a cycle  they put together a breathing apparatus. And this breathing apparatus now saved the life  and she's very welcome. There's a whole range of innovations that we have. A car  which runs on compressed air with six paisa per kilometer. Assam  Kanak Gogoi. And you would not find this car in U.S. or Europe  but this is available in India. Now  this lady  she used to do the winding of the yarn for Pochampally Saree. In one day         times  she had to do this winding to generate two sarees. This is what her son has done after seven years of struggle. She said   Change your profession.  He said   I can't. This is the only thing I know  but I'll invent a machine  which will solve your problem.  And this is what he did  a sewing machine in Uttar Pradesh. So  this is what SRISTI is saying   Give me a place to stand  and I will move the world.  I will just tell you that we are also doing a competition among children for creativity  a whole range of things. We have sold things all over the world  from Ethiopia to Turkey to U.S. to wherever. Products have gone to the market  a few. These are the people whose knowledge made this Herbavate cream for eczema possible. And here  a company which licensed this herbal pesticide put a photograph of the innovator on the packing so that every time a user uses it  it asks the user   You can also be an innovator. If you have an idea  send it back to us.  So  creativity counts  knowledge matters  innovations transform  incentives inspire. And incentives  not just material  but also non material incentives. Thank you. For me  this story begins about    years ago  when I was a hospice doctor at the University of Chicago. And I was taking care of people who were dying and their families in the South Side of Chicago. And I was observing what happened to people and their families over the course of their terminal illness. And in my lab  I was studying the widower effect  which is a very old idea in the social sciences  going back     years  known as  dying of a broken heart.  So  when I die  my wife's risk of death can double  for instance  in the first year. And I had gone to take care of one particular patient  a woman who was dying of dementia. And in this case  unlike this couple  she was being cared for by her daughter. And the daughter was exhausted from caring for her mother. And the daughter's husband  he also was sick from his wife's exhaustion. And I was driving home one day  and I get a phone call from the husband's friend  calling me because he was depressed about what was happening to his friend. So here I get this call from this random guy that's having an experience that's being influenced by people at some social distance. And so I suddenly realized two very simple things  First  the widowhood effect was not restricted to husbands and wives. And second  it was not restricted to pairs of people. And I started to see the world in a whole new way  like pairs of people connected to each other. And then I realized that these individuals would be connected into foursomes with other pairs of people nearby. And then  in fact  these people were embedded in other sorts of relationships  marriage and spousal and friendship and other sorts of ties. And that  in fact  these connections were vast and that we were all embedded in this broad set of connections with each other. So I started to see the world in a completely new way and I became obsessed with this. I became obsessed with how it might be that we're embedded in these social networks  and how they affect our lives. So  social networks are these intricate things of beauty  and they're so elaborate and so complex and so ubiquitous  in fact  that one has to ask what purpose they serve. Why are we embedded in social networks  I mean  how do they form  How do they operate  And how do they effect us  So my first topic with respect to this  was not death  but obesity. It had become trendy to speak about the  obesity epidemic.  And  along with my collaborator  James Fowler  we began to wonder whether obesity really was epidemic and could it spread from person to person like the four people I discussed earlier. So this is a slide of some of our initial results. It's       people in the year     . Every dot is a person. We make the dot size proportional to people's body size  so bigger dots are bigger people. In addition  if your body size  if your BMI  your body mass index  is above       if you're clinically obese    we also colored the dots yellow. So  if you look at this image  right away you might be able to see that there are clusters of obese and non obese people in the image. But the visual complexity is still very high. It's not obvious exactly what's going on. In addition  some questions are immediately raised  How much clustering is there  Is there more clustering than would be due to chance alone  How big are the clusters  How far do they reach  And  most importantly  what causes the clusters  So we did some mathematics to study the size of these clusters. This here shows  on the Y axis  the increase in the probability that a person is obese given that a social contact of theirs is obese and  on the X axis  the degrees of separation between the two people. On the far left  you see the purple line. It says that  if your friends are obese  your risk of obesity is    percent higher. And the next bar over  the  red  line  says if your friend's friends are obese  your risk of obesity is    percent higher. And then the next line over says if your friend's friend's friend  someone you probably don't even know  is obese  your risk of obesity is    percent higher. And it's only when you get to your friend's friend's friend's friends that there's no longer a relationship between that person's body size and your own body size. Well  what might be causing this clustering  There are at least three possibilities  One possibility is that  as I gain weight  it causes you to gain weight. A kind of induction  a kind of spread from person to person. Another possibility  very obvious  is homophily  or  birds of a feather flock together  here  I form my tie to you because you and I share a similar body size. And the last possibility is what is known as confounding  because it confounds our ability to figure out what's going on. And here  the idea is not that my weight gain is causing your weight gain  nor that I preferentially form a tie with you because you and I share the same body size  but rather that we share a common exposure to something  like a health club that makes us both lose weight at the same time. When we studied these data  we found evidence for all of these things  including for induction. And we found that if your friend becomes obese  it increases your risk of obesity by about    percent in the same given time period. There can be many mechanisms for this effect  One possibility is that your friends say to you something like    you know  they adopt a behavior that spreads to you    like  they say   Let's go have muffins and beer   which is a terrible combination.  Laughter  But you adopt that combination  and then you start gaining weight like them. Another more subtle possibility is that they start gaining weight  and it changes your ideas of what an acceptable body size is. Here  what's spreading from person to person is not a behavior  but rather a norm  An idea is spreading. Now  headline writers had a field day with our studies. I think the headline in The New York Times was   Are you packing it on  Blame your fat friends.   Laughter  What was interesting to us is that the European headline writers had a different take  They said   Are your friends gaining weight  Perhaps you are to blame.  And we thought this was a very interesting comment on America  and a kind of self serving   not my responsibility  kind of phenomenon. Now  I want to be very clear  We do not think our work should or could justify prejudice against people of one or another body size at all. Our next questions was  Could we actually visualize this spread  Was weight gain in one person actually spreading to weight gain in another person  And this was complicated because we needed to take into account the fact that the network structure  the architecture of the ties  was changing across time. In addition  because obesity is not a unicentric epidemic  there's not a Patient Zero of the obesity epidemic    if we find that guy  there was a spread of obesity out from him    it's a multicentric epidemic. Lots of people are doing things at the same time. And I'm about to show you a    second video animation that took me and James five years of our lives to do. So  again  every dot is a person. Every tie between them is a relationship. We're going to put this into motion now  taking daily cuts through the network for about    years. The dot sizes are going to grow  you're going to see a sea of yellow take over. You're going to see people be born and die    dots will appear and disappear    ties will form and break  marriages and divorces  friendings and defriendings. A lot of complexity  a lot is happening just in this    year period that includes the obesity epidemic. And  by the end  you're going to see clusters of obese and non obese individuals within the network. Now  when looked at this  it changed the way I see things  because this thing  this network that's changing across time  it has a memory  it moves  things flow within it  it has a kind of consistency    people can die  but it doesn't die  it still persists    and it has a kind of resilience that allows it to persist across time. And so  I came to see these kinds of social networks as living things  as living things that we could put under a kind of microscope to study and analyze and understand. And we used a variety of techniques to do this. And we started exploring all kinds of other phenomena. We looked at smoking and drinking behavior  and voting behavior  and divorce    which can spread    and altruism. And  eventually  we became interested in emotions. Now  when we have emotions  we show them. Why do we show our emotions  I mean  there would be an advantage to experiencing our emotions inside  you know  anger or happiness. But we don't just experience them  we show them. And not only do we show them  but others can read them. And  not only can they read them  but they copy them. There's emotional contagion that takes place in human populations. And so this function of emotions suggests that  in addition to any other purpose they serve  they're a kind of primitive form of communication. And that  in fact  if we really want to understand human emotions  we need to think about them in this way. Now  we're accustomed to thinking about emotions in this way  in simple  sort of  brief periods of time. So  for example  I was giving this talk recently in New York City  and I said   You know when you're on the subway and the other person across the subway car smiles at you  and you just instinctively smile back   And they looked at me and said   We don't do that in New York City.   Laughter  And I said   Everywhere else in the world  that's normal human behavior.  And so there's a very instinctive way in which we briefly transmit emotions to each other. And  in fact  emotional contagion can be broader still. Like we could have punctuated expressions of anger  as in riots. The question that we wanted to ask was  Could emotion spread  in a more sustained way than riots  across time and involve large numbers of people  not just this pair of individuals smiling at each other in the subway car  Maybe there's a kind of below the surface  quiet riot that animates us all the time. Maybe there are emotional stampedes that ripple through social networks. Maybe  in fact  emotions have a collective existence  not just an individual existence. And this is one of the first images we made to study this phenomenon. Again  a social network  but now we color the people yellow if they're happy and blue if they're sad and green in between. And if you look at this image  you can right away see clusters of happy and unhappy people  again  spreading to three degrees of separation. And you might form the intuition that the unhappy people occupy a different structural location within the network. There's a middle and an edge to this network  and the unhappy people seem to be located at the edges. So to invoke another metaphor  if you imagine social networks as a kind of vast fabric of humanity    I'm connected to you and you to her  on out endlessly into the distance    this fabric is actually like an old fashioned American quilt  and it has patches on it  happy and unhappy patches. And whether you become happy or not depends in part on whether you occupy a happy patch. So  this work with emotions  which are so fundamental  then got us to thinking about  Maybe the fundamental causes of human social networks are somehow encoded in our genes. Because human social networks  whenever they are mapped  always kind of look like this  the picture of the network. But they never look like this. Why do they not look like this  Why don't we form human social networks that look like a regular lattice  Well  the striking patterns of human social networks  their ubiquity and their apparent purpose beg questions about whether we evolved to have human social networks in the first place  and whether we evolved to form networks with a particular structure. And notice first of all    so  to understand this  though  we need to dissect network structure a little bit first    and notice that every person in this network has exactly the same structural location as every other person. But that's not the case with real networks. So  for example  here is a real network of college students at an elite northeastern university. And now I'm highlighting a few dots. If you look here at the dots  compare node B in the upper left to node D in the far right  B has four friends coming out from him and D has six friends coming out from him. And so  those two individuals have different numbers of friends. That's very obvious  we all know that. But certain other aspects of social network structure are not so obvious. Compare node B in the upper left to node A in the lower left. Now  those people both have four friends  but A's friends all know each other  and B's friends do not. So the friend of a friend of A's is  back again  a friend of A's  whereas the friend of a friend of B's is not a friend of B's  but is farther away in the network. This is known as transitivity in networks. And  finally  compare nodes C and D  C and D both have six friends. If you talk to them  and you said   What is your social life like   they would say   I've got six friends. That's my social experience.  But now we  with a bird's eye view looking at this network  can see that they occupy very different social worlds. And I can cultivate that intuition in you by just asking you  Who would you rather be if a deadly germ was spreading through the network  Would you rather be C or D  You'd rather be D  on the edge of the network. And now who would you rather be if a juicy piece of gossip    not about you    was spreading through the network   Laughter  Now  you would rather be C. So different structural locations have different implications for your life. And  in fact  when we did some experiments looking at this  what we found is that    percent of the variation in how many friends you have is explained by your genes. And this is not surprising. We know that some people are born shy and some are born gregarious. That's obvious. But we also found some non obvious things. For instance     percent in the variation in whether your friends know each other is attributable to your genes. Whether your friends know each other has not just to do with their genes  but with yours. And we think the reason for this is that some people like to introduce their friends to each other    you know who you are    and others of you keep them apart and don't introduce your friends to each other. And so some people knit together the networks around them  creating a kind of dense web of ties in which they're comfortably embedded. And finally  we even found that    percent of the variation in whether or not people are in the middle or on the edge of the network can also be attributed to their genes. So whether you find yourself in the middle or on the edge is also partially heritable. Now  what is the point of this  How does this help us understand  How does this help us figure out some of the problems that are affecting us these days  Well  the argument I'd like to make is that networks have value. They are a kind of social capital. New properties emerge because of our embeddedness in social networks  and these properties inhere in the structure of the networks  not just in the individuals within them. So think about these two common objects. They're both made of carbon  and yet one of them has carbon atoms in it that are arranged in one particular way    on the left    and you get graphite  which is soft and dark. But if you take the same carbon atoms and interconnect them a different way  you get diamond  which is clear and hard. And those properties of softness and hardness and darkness and clearness do not reside in the carbon atoms  they reside in the interconnections between the carbon atoms  or at least arise because of the interconnections between the carbon atoms. So  similarly  the pattern of connections among people confers upon the groups of people different properties. It is the ties between people that makes the whole greater than the sum of its parts. And so it is not just what's happening to these people    whether they're losing weight or gaining weight  or becoming rich or becoming poor  or becoming happy or not becoming happy    that affects us  it's also the actual architecture of the ties around us. Our experience of the world depends on the actual structure of the networks in which we're residing and on all the kinds of things that ripple and flow through the network. Now  the reason  I think  that this is the case is that human beings assemble themselves and form a kind of superorganism. Now  a superorganism is a collection of individuals which show or evince behaviors or phenomena that are not reducible to the study of individuals and that must be understood by reference to  and by studying  the collective. Like  for example  a hive of bees that's finding a new nesting site  or a flock of birds that's evading a predator  or a flock of birds that's able to pool its wisdom and navigate and find a tiny speck of an island in the middle of the Pacific  or a pack of wolves that's able to bring down larger prey. Superorganisms have properties that cannot be understood just by studying the individuals. I think understanding social networks and how they form and operate can help us understand not just health and emotions but all kinds of other phenomena    like crime  and warfare  and economic phenomena like bank runs and market crashes and the adoption of innovation and the spread of product adoption. Now  look at this. I think we form social networks because the benefits of a connected life outweigh the costs. If I was always violent towards you or gave you misinformation or made you sad or infected you with deadly germs  you would cut the ties to me  and the network would disintegrate. So the spread of good and valuable things is required to sustain and nourish social networks. Similarly  social networks are required for the spread of good and valuable things  like love and kindness and happiness and altruism and ideas. I think  in fact  that if we realized how valuable social networks are  we'd spend a lot more time nourishing them and sustaining them  because I think social networks are fundamentally related to goodness. And what I think the world needs now is more connections. Thank you. We invent. My company invents all kinds of new technology in lots of different areas. And we do that for a couple of reasons. We invent for fun    invention is a lot of fun to do    and we also invent for profit. The two are related because the profit actually takes long enough that if it isn't fun  you wouldn't have the time to do it. So we do this fun and profit oriented inventing for most of what we do  but we also have a program where we invent for humanity    where we take some of our best inventors  and we say   Are there problems where we have a good idea for solving a problem the world has      and to solve it in the way we try to solve problems  which is with dramatic  crazy  out of the box solutions. Bill Gates is one of those smartest guys of ours that work on these problems and he also funds this work  so thank you. So I'm going to briefly discuss a couple of problems that we have and a couple of problems where we've got some solutions underway. Vaccination is one of the key techniques in public health  a fantastic thing. But in the developing world a lot of vaccines spoil before they're administered  and that's because they need to be kept cold. Almost all vaccines need to be kept at refrigerator temperatures. They go bad very quickly if you don't  and if you don't have stable power grid  this doesn't happen  so kids die. It's not just the loss of the vaccine that matters  it's the fact that those kids don't get vaccinated. This is one of the ways that vaccines are carried  These are Styrofoam chests. These are being carried by people  but they're also put on the backs of pickup trucks. We've got a different solution. Now  one of these Styrofoam chests will last for about four hours with ice in it. And we thought  well  that's not really good enough. So we made this thing. This lasts six months with no power  absolutely zero power  because it loses less than a half a watt. Now  this is our second generations prototype. The third generation prototype is  right now  in Uganda being tested. Now  the reason we were able to come up with this is two key ideas  One is that this is similar to a cryogenic Dewar  something you'd keep liquid nitrogen or liquid helium in. They have incredible insulation  so let's put some incredible insulation here. The other idea is kind of interesting  which is  you can't reach inside anymore. Because if you open it up and reach inside  you'd let the heat in  the game would be over. So the inside of this thing actually looks like a Coke machine. It vends out little individual vials. So a simple idea  which we hope is going to change the way vaccines are distributed in Africa and around the world. We'll move on to malaria. Malaria is one of the great public health problems. Esther Duflo talked a little bit about this. Two hundred million people a year. Every    seconds a child in Africa dies     will die during my talk. And there's no way for us here in this country to grasp really what that means to the people involved. Another comment of Esther's was that we react when there's a tragedy like Haiti  but that tragedy is ongoing. So what can we do about it  Well  there are a lot of things people have tried for many years for solving malaria. You can spray  the problem is there are environmental issues. You can try to treat people and create awareness. That's great  except the places that have malaria really bad  they don't have health care systems. A vaccine would be a terrific thing  only they don't work yet. People have tried for a long time. There are a couple of interesting candidates. It's a very difficult thing to make a vaccine for. You can distribute bed nets  and bed nets are very effective if you use them. You don't always use them for that. People fish with them. They don't always get to everyone. And bed nets have an effect on the epidemic  but you're never going to make it extinct with bed nets. Now  malaria is an incredibly complicated disease. We could spend hours going over this. It's got this sort of soap opera like lifestyle  they have sex  they burrow into your liver  they tunnel into your blood cells ... it's an incredibly complicated disease  but that's actually one of the things we find interesting about it and why we work on malaria  There's a lot of potential ways in. One of those ways might be better diagnosis. So we hope this year to prototype each of these devices. One does an automatic malaria diagnosis in the same way that a diabetic's glucose meter works  You take a drop of blood  you put it in there and it automatically tells you. Today  you need to do a complicated laboratory procedure  create a bunch of microscope slides and have a trained person examine it. The other thing is  you know  it would be even better if you didn't have to draw the blood. And if you look through the eye  or you look at the vessels on the white of the eye  in fact  you may be able to do this directly  without drawing any blood at all  or through your nail beds. Because if you actually look through your fingernails  you can see blood vessels  and once you see blood vessels  we think we can see the malaria. We can see it because of this molecule called hemozoin. It's produced by the malaria parasite and it's a very interesting crystalline substance. Interesting  anyway  if you're a solid state physicist. There's a lot of cool stuff we can do with it. This is our femtosecond laser lab. So this creates pulses of light that last a femtosecond. That's really  really  really short. This is a pulse of light that's only about one wavelength of light long  so it's a whole bunch of photons all coming and hitting simultaneously. It creates a very high peak power and it lets you do all kinds of interesting things  in particular  it lets you find hemozoin. So here's an image of red blood cells  and now we can actually map where the hemozoin and where the malaria parasites are inside those red blood cells. And using both this technique and other optical techniques  we think we can make those diagnostics. We also have another hemozoin oriented therapy for malaria  a way  in acute cases  to actually take the malaria parasite and filter it out of the blood system. Sort of like doing dialysis  but for relieving the parasite load. This is our thousand core supercomputer. We're kind of software guys  and so nearly any problem that you pose  we like to try to solve with some software. One of the problems that you have if you're trying to eradicate malaria or reduce it is you don't know what's the most effective thing to do. Okay  we heard about bed nets earlier. You spend a certain amount per bed net. Or you could spray. You can give drug administration. There's all these different interventions but they have different kinds of effectiveness. How can you tell  So we've created  using our supercomputer  the world's best computer model of malaria  which we'll show you now. We picked Madagascar. We have every road  every village  every  almost  square inch of Madagascar. We have all of the precipitation data and the temperature data. That's very important because the humidity and precipitation tell you whether you've got standing pools of water for the mosquitoes to breed. So that sets the stage on which you do this. You then have to introduce the mosquitoes  and you have to model that and how they come and go. Ultimately  it gives you this. This is malaria spreading across Madagascar. And this is this latter part of the rainy season. We're going to the dry season now. It nearly goes away in the dry season  because there's no place for the mosquitoes to breed. And then  of course  the next year it comes roaring back. By doing these kinds of simulations  we want to eradicate or control malaria thousands of times in software before we actually have to do it in real life  to be able to simulate both the economic trade offs    how many bed nets versus how much spraying     or the social trade offs    what happens if unrest breaks out  We also try to study our foe. This is a high speed camera view of a mosquito. And  in a moment  we're going to see a view of the airflow. Here  we're trying to visualize the airflow around the wings of the mosquito with little particles we're illuminating with a laser. By understanding how mosquitoes fly  we hope to understand how to make them not fly. Now  one of the ways you can make them not fly is with DDT. This is a real ad. This is one of those things you just can't make up. Once upon a time  this was the primary technique  and  in fact  many countries got rid of malaria through DDT. The United States did. In       there were         cases a year of malaria in the United States  but DDT and a massive public health effort managed to squelch it. So we thought   Well  we've done all these things that are focused on the Plasmodium  the parasite involved. What can we do to the mosquito  Well  let's try to kill it with consumer electronics.  Now  that sounds silly  but each of these devices has something interesting in it that maybe you could use. Your Blu ray player has a very cheap blue laser. Your laser printer has a mirror galvanometer that's used to steer a laser beam very accurately  that's what makes those little dots on the page. And  of course  there's signal processing and digital cameras. So what if we could put all that together to shoot them out of the sky with lasers  Now  in our company  this is what we call  the pinky suck moment.  What if we could do that  Now  just suspend disbelief for a moment  and let's think of what could happen if we could do that. Well  we could protect very high value targets like clinics. Clinics are full of people that have malaria. They're sick  and so they're less able to defend themselves from the mosquitoes. You really want to protect them. Of course  if you do that  you could also protect your backyard. And farmers could protect their crops that they want to sell to Whole Foods because our photons are     percent organic.  Laughter  They're completely natural. Now  it actually gets better than this. You could  if you're really smart  you could shine a nonlethal laser on the bug before you zap it  and you could listen to the wing beat frequency and you could measure the size. And then you could decide   Is this an insect I want to kill  or an insect I don't want to kill   Moore's law made computing cheap  so cheap we can weigh the life of an individual insect and decide thumbs up or thumbs down.  Laughter  Now  it turns out we only kill the female mosquitoes. They're the only ones that are dangerous. Mosquitoes only drink blood to lay eggs. Mosquitoes actually live ... their day to day nutrition comes from nectar  from flowers    in fact  in the lab  we feed ours raisins    but the female needs the blood meal. So  this sounds really crazy  right  Would you like to see it  Audience  Yeah  Nathan Myhrvold  Okay  so our legal department prepared a disclaimer  and here it is. Now  after thinking about this a little bit we thought  you know  it probably would be simpler to do this with a nonlethal laser. So  Eric Johanson  who built the device  actually  with parts from eBay  and Pablos Holman over here  he's got mosquitoes in the tank. We have the device over here. And we're going to show you  instead of the kill laser  which will be a very brief  instantaneous pulse  we're going to have a green laser pointer that's going to stay on the mosquito for  actually  quite a long period of time  otherwise  you can't see it very well. Take it away Eric. Eric Johanson  What we have here is a tank on the other side of the stage. And we have ... this computer screen can actually see the mosquitoes as they fly around. And Pablos  if he stirs up our mosquitoes a little bit we can see them flying around. Now  that's a fairly straightforward image processing routine  and let me show you how it works. Here you can see that the insects are being tracked as they're flying around  which is kind of fun. Next we can actually light them up with a laser.  Laughter  Now  this is a low powered laser  and we can actually pick up a wing beat frequency. So you may be able to hear some mosquitoes flying around. NM  That's a mosquito wing beat you're hearing. EJ  Finally  let's see what this looks like. There you can see mosquitoes as they fly around  being lit up. This is slowed way down so that you have an opportunity to see what's happening. Here we have it running at high speed mode. So this system that was built for TED is here to illustrate that it is technically possible to actually deploy a system like this  and we're looking very hard at how to make it highly cost effective to use in places like Africa and other parts of the world. NM  So it wouldn't be any fun to show you that without showing you what actually happens when we hit 'em. This is very satisfying. This is one of the first ones we did. The energy's a little bit high here. We'll loop around here in just a second  and you'll see another one. Here's another one. Bang. An interesting thing is  we kill them all the time  we've never actually gotten the wings to shut off in midair. The wing motor is very resilient. I mean  here we're blowing wings off but the wing motor keeps all the way down. So  that's what I have. Thanks very much. I'm going to tell you two things today  One is what we have lost  and two  a way to bring it back. And let me start with this. This is my baseline  This is the Mediterranean coast with no fish  bare rock and lots of sea urchins that like to eat the algae. Something like this is what I first saw when I jumped in the water for the first time in the Mediterranean coast off Spain. Now  if an alien came to earth    let's call him Joe    what would Joe see  If Joe jumped in a coral reef  there are many things the alien could see. Very unlikely  Joe would jump on a pristine coral reef  a virgin coral reef with lots of coral  sharks  crocodiles  manatees  groupers  turtles  etc. So  probably  what Joe would see would be in this part  in the greenish part of the picture. Here we have the extreme with dead corals  microbial soup and jellyfish. And where the diver is  this is probably where most of the reefs of the world are now  with very few corals  algae overgrowing the corals  lots of bacteria  and where the large animals are gone. And this is what most marine scientists have seen too. This is their baseline. This is what they think is natural because we started modern science with scuba diving long after we started degrading marine ecosystems. So I'm going to get us all on a time machine  and we're going to the left  we're going to go back to the past to see what the ocean was like. And let's start with this time machine  the Line Islands  where we have conducted a series of National Geographic expeditions. This sea is an archipelago belonging to Kiribati that spans across the equator and it has several uninhabited  unfished  pristine islands and a few inhabited islands. So let's start with the first one  Christmas Island  over       people. Most of the reefs are dead  most of the corals are dead    overgrown by algae    and most of the fish are smaller than the pencils we use to count them. We did     hours of diving here in     . We didn't see a single shark. This is the place that Captain Cook discovered in      and he described a huge abundance of sharks biting the rudders and the oars of their small boats while they were going ashore. Let's move the dial a little bit to the past. Fanning Island        people. The corals are doing better here. Lots of small fish. This is what many divers would consider paradise. This is where you can see most of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. And many people think this is really  really beautiful  if this is your baseline. If we go back to a place like Palmyra Atoll  where I was with Jeremy Jackson a few years ago  the corals are doing better and there are sharks. You can see sharks in every single dive. And this is something that is very unusual in today's coral reefs. But then  if we shift the dial          years back  then we get to the places where the corals are absolutely healthy and gorgeous  forming spectacular structures  and where the predators are the most conspicuous thing  where you see between    and    sharks per dive. What have we learned from these places  This is what we thought was natural. This is what we call the biomass pyramid. If we get all of the fish of a coral reef together and weigh them  this is what we would expect. Most of the biomass is low on the food chain  the herbivores  the parrotfish  the surgeonfish that eat the algae. Then the plankton feeders  these little damselfish  the little animals floating in the water. And then we have a lower biomass of carnivores  and a lower biomass of top head  or the sharks  the large snappers  the large groupers. But this is a consequence. This view of the world is a consequence of having studied degraded reefs. When we went to pristine reefs  we realized that the natural world was upside down  this pyramid was inverted. The top head does account for most of the biomass  in some places up to    percent  like Kingman Reef  which is now protected. The good news is that  in addition to having more predators  there's more of everything. The size of these boxes is bigger. We have more sharks  more biomass of snappers  more biomass of herbivores  too  like these parrot fish that are like marine goats. They clean the reef  everything that grows enough to be seen  they eat  and they keep the reef clean and allow the corals to replenish. Not only do these places    these ancient  pristine places    have lots of fish  but they also have other important components of the ecosystem like the giant clams  pavements of giant clams in the lagoons  up to        per square meter. These have disappeared from every inhabited reef in the world  and they filter the water  they keep the water clean from microbes and pathogens. But still  now we have global warming. If we don't have fishing because these reefs are protected by law or their remoteness  this is great. But the water gets warmer for too long and the corals die. So how are these fish  these predators going to help  Well  what we have seen is that in this particular area during El Nino  year '    '    the water was too warm for too long  and many corals bleached and many died. In Christmas  where the food web is really trimmed down  where the large animals are gone  the corals have not recovered. In Fanning Island  the corals are not recovered. But you see here a big table coral that died and collapsed. And the fish have grazed the algae  so the turf of algae is a little lower. Then you go to Palmyra Atoll that has more biomass of herbivores  and the dead corals are clean  and the corals are coming back. And when you go to the pristine side  did this ever bleach  These places bleached too  but they recovered faster. The more intact  the more complete   and  the more complex your food web  the higher the resilience   and  the more likely that the system is going to recover from the short term impacts of warming events. And that's good news  so we need to recover that structure. We need to make sure that all of the pieces of the ecosystem are there so the ecosystem can adapt to the effects of global warming. So if we have to reset the baseline  if we have to push the ecosystem back to the left  how can we do it  Well  there are several ways. One very clear way is the marine protected areas  especially no take reserves that we set aside to allow for the recovery for marine life. And let me go back to that image of the Mediterranean. This was my baseline. This is what I saw when I was a kid. And at the same time I was watching Jacques Cousteau's shows on TV  with all this richness and abundance and diversity. And I thought that this richness belonged to tropical seas  and that the Mediterranean was a naturally poor sea. But  little did I know  until I jumped for the first time in a marine reserve. And this is what I saw  lots of fish. After a few years  between five and seven years  fish come back  they eat the urchins  and then the algae grow again. So you have this little algal forest  and in the size of a laptop you can find more than     species of algae  mostly microscopic fit hundreds of species of little animals that then feed the fish  so that the system recovers. And this particular place  the Medes Islands Marine Reserve  is only    hectares  and it brings   million euros to the local economy     times more than fishing  and it represents    percent of all the tourist revenue. So these places not only help the ecosystem but also help the people who can benefit from the ecosystem. So let me just give you a summary of what no take reserves do. These places  when we protect them  if we compare them to unprotected areas nearby  this is what happens. The number of species increases    percent  so if you have       species you would expect     more in a marine reserve. This is very substantial. The size of organisms increases a third  so your fish are now this big. The abundance  how many fish you have per square meter  increases almost     percent. And the biomass    this is the most spectacular change     .  times greater biomass on average  just after five to seven years. In some places up to    times larger biomass inside the reserves. So we have all these things inside the reserve that grow  and what do they do  They reproduce. That's population biology    . If you don't kill the fish  they take a longer time to die  they grow larger and they reproduce a lot. And same thing for invertebrates. This is the example. These are egg cases laid by a snail off the coast of Chile  and this is how many eggs they lay on the bottom. Outside the reserve  you cannot even detect this. One point three million eggs per square meter inside the marine reserve where these snails are very abundant. So these organisms reproduce  the little larvae juveniles spill over  they all spill over  and then people can benefit from them outside too. This is in the Bahamas  Nassau grouper. Huge abundance of groupers inside the reserve  and the closer you get to the reserve  the more fish you have. So the fishermen are catching more. You can see where the limits of the reserve are because you see the boats lined up. So there is spill over  there are benefits beyond the boundaries of these reserves that help people around them  while at the same time the reserve is protecting the entire habitat. It is building resilience. So what we have now    or a world without reserves    is like a debit account where we withdraw all the time and we never make any deposit. Reserves are like savings accounts. We have this principal that we don't touch  that produces returns  social  economic and ecological. And if we think about the increase of biomass inside the reserves  this is like compound interest. Two examples  again  of how these reserves can benefit people. This is how much fishermen get everyday in Kenya  fishing over a series of years  in a place where there is no protection  it's a free for all. Once the most degrading fishing gear  seine nets  were removed  the fishermen were catching more. If you fish less  you're actually catching more. But if we add the no take reserve on top of that  the fishermen are still making more money by fishing less around an area that is protected. Another example  Nassau groupers in Belize in the Mesoamerican Reef. This is grouper sex  and the groupers aggregate around the full moons of December and January for a week. They used to aggregate up to the tens of thousands         groupers about this big in one hectare  in one aggregation. Fishermen knew about these things  they caught them  and they depleted them. When I went there for the first time in       there were only       groupers left. And the fishermen were authorized to catch    percent of the entire spawning population every year. So we did a simple analysis  and it doesn't take rocket science to figure out that  if you take    percent every year  your fishery is going to collapse very quickly. And with the fishery  the entire reproductive ability of the species goes extinct. It happened in many places around the Caribbean. And they would make       dollars per year  total  for the entire fishery  several fishing boats. Now  if you do an economic analysis and project what would happen if the fish were not cut  if we brought just    divers one month per year  the revenue would be more than    times higher and that would be sustainable over time. So how much of this do we have  If this is so good  if this is such a no brainer  how much of this do we have  And you already heard that less than one percent of the ocean's protected. We're getting closer to one percent now  thanks to the protections of the Chagos Archipelago  and only a fraction of this is fully protected from fishing. Scientific studies recommend that at least    percent of the ocean should be protected. The estimated range is between    and    percent for a series of goals of biodiversity and fishery enhancement and resilience. Now  is this possible  People would ask  How much would that cost  Well  let's think about how much we are paying now to subsidize fishing     billion dollars per year. Many of these subsidies go to destructive fishing practices. Well  there are a couple estimates of how much it would cost to create a network of protected areas covering    percent of the ocean that would be only a fraction of what we are now paying  the government hands out to a fishery that is collapsing. People are losing their jobs because the fisheries are collapsing. A creation of a network of reserves would provide direct employment for more than a million people plus all the secondary jobs and all the secondary benefits. So how can we do that  If it's so clear that these savings accounts are good for the environment and for people  why don't we have        percent of the ocean  And how can we reach that goal  Well  there are two ways of getting there. The trivial solution is to create really large protected areas like the Chagos Archipelago. The problem is that we can create these large reserves only in places where there are no people  where there is no social conflict  where the political cost is really low and the economic cost is also low. And a few of us  a few organizations in this room and elsewhere are working on this. But what about the rest of the coast of the world  where people live and make a living out of fishing  Well  there are three main reasons why we don't have tens of thousands of small reserves  The first one is that people have no idea what marine reserves do  and fishermen tend to be really  really defensive when it comes to regulating or closing an area  even if it's small. Second  the governance is not right because most coastal communities around the world don't have the authority to monitor the resources to create the reserve and enforce it. It's a top down hierarchical structure where people wait for government agents to come and this is not effective. And the government doesn't have enough resources. Which takes us to the third reason  why we don't have many more reserves  is that the funding models have been wrong. NGOs and governments spend a lot of time and energy and resources in a few small areas  usually. So marine conservation and coastal protection has become a sink for government or philanthropic money  and this is not sustainable. So the solutions are just fixing these three issues. First  we need to develop a global awareness campaign to inspire local communities and governments to create no take reserves that are better than what we have now. It's the savings accounts versus the debit accounts with no deposits. Second  we need to redesign our governance so conservation efforts can be decentralized  so conservation efforts don't depend on work from NGOs or from government agencies and can be created by the local communities  like it happens in the Philippines and a few other places. And third  and very important  we need to develop new business models. The philanthropy sink as the only way to create reserves is not sustainable. We really need to develop models  business models  where coastal conservation is an investment  because we already know that these marine reserves provide social  ecological and economic benefits. And I'd like to finish with one thought  which is that no one organization alone is going to save the ocean. There has been a lot of competition in the past  and we need to develop a new model of partnership  truly collaborative  where we are looking for complementing  not substituting. The stakes are just too high to continue the way we are going. So let's do that. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Thank you Enric. Enric Sala  Thank you. CA  That was a masterful job of pulling things together. First of all  your pyramid  your inverted pyramid  showing    percent biomass in the predators  that seems impossible. How could    percent survive on    percent  ES  Well  imagine that you have two gears of a watch  a big one and a small one. The big one is moving very slowly  and the small one is moving fast. That's basically it. The animals at the lower parts of the food chain  they reproduce very fast  they grow really fast  they produce millions of eggs. Up there  you have sharks and large fish that live        years. They reproduce very slowly  they have a slow metabolism  and  basically  they just maintain their biomass. So  basically  the production surplus of these guys down there is enough to maintain this biomass that is not moving. They are like capacitors of the system. CA  That's very fascinating. So  really  our picture of a food pyramid is just    we have to change that completely. ES  At least in the seas. What we found in coral reefs is that the inverted pyramid is the equivalent of the Serengeti  with five lions per wildebeest. And on land  this cannot work. But at least on coral reefs are systems where there is a bottom component with structure. We think this is universal. But we have started studying pristine reefs only very recently. CA  So the numbers you presented really are astonishing. You're saying we're spending    billion dollars now on subsidies. It would only cost    billion to set up    percent of the ocean as marine protected areas that actually give new living choices to the fishermen as well. If the world was a smarter place  we could solve this problem for negative    billion dollars. We've got    billion to spend on health care or something. ES  And then we have the under performance of fisheries that is    billion dollars. So again  one of the big solutions is have the World Trade Organization shifting the subsidies to sustainable practices. CA  Okay  so there's a lot of examples that I'm hearing out there about ending this subsidies madness. So thank you for those numbers. The last one's a personal question. A lot of the experience of people here who've been in the oceans for a long time has just been seeing this degradation  the places they saw that were beautiful getting worse  depressing. Talk to me about the feeling that you must have experienced of going to these pristine areas and seeing things coming back. ES  It is a spiritual experience. We go there to try to understand the ecosystems  to try to measure or count fish and sharks and see how these places are different from the places we know. But the best feeling is this biophilia that E.O. Wilson talks about  where humans have this sense of awe and wonder in front of untamed nature  of raw nature. And there  only there  you really feel that you are part of a larger thing or of a larger global ecosystem. And if it were not for these places that show hope  I don't think I could continue doing this job. It would be just too depressing. CA  Well  Enric  thank you so much for sharing some of that spiritual experience with us all. Thank you. ES  Thank you very much. Can I ask you to please recall a time when you really loved something    a movie  an album  a song or a book    and you recommended it wholeheartedly to someone you also really liked  and you anticipated that reaction  you waited for it  and it came back  and the person hated it  So  by way of introduction  that is the exact same state in which I spent every working day of the last six years.  Laughter  I teach high school math. I sell a product to a market that doesn't want it  but is forced by law to buy it. I mean  it's just a losing proposition. So there's a useful stereotype about students that I see  a useful stereotype about you all. I could give you guys an algebra two final exam  and I would expect no higher than a    percent pass rate. And both of these facts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call math education in the U.S. today. To start with  I'd like to break math down into two categories. One is computation  this is the stuff you've forgotten. For example  factoring quadratics with leading coefficients greater than one. This stuff is also really easy to relearn  provided you have a really strong grounding in reasoning. Math reasoning    we'll call it the application of math processes to the world around us    this is hard to teach. This is what we would love students to retain  even if they don't go into mathematical fields. This is also something that  the way we teach it in the U.S. all but ensures they won't retain it. So  I'd like to talk about why that is  why that's such a calamity for society  what we can do about it and  to close with  why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher. So first  five symptoms that you're doing math reasoning wrong in your classroom. One is a lack of initiative  your students don't self start. You finish your lecture block and immediately you have five hands going up asking you to re explain the entire thing at their desks. Students lack perseverance. They lack retention  you find yourself re explaining concepts three months later  wholesale. There's an aversion to word problems  which describes    percent of my students. And then the other one percent is eagerly looking for the formula to apply in that situation. This is really destructive. David Milch  creator of  Deadwood  and other amazing TV shows  has a really good description for this. He swore off creating contemporary drama  shows set in the present day  because he saw that when people fill their mind with four hours a day of  for example   Two and a Half Men   no disrespect  it shapes the neural pathways  he said  in such a way that they expect simple problems. He called it   an impatience with irresolution.  You're impatient with things that don't resolve quickly. You expect sitcom sized problems that wrap up in    minutes  three commercial breaks and a laugh track. And I'll put it to all of you  what you already know  that no problem worth solving is that simple. I am very concerned about this because I'm going to retire in a world that my students will run. I'm doing bad things to my own future and well being when I teach this way. I'm here to tell you that the way our textbooks    particularly mass adopted textbooks    teach math reasoning and patient problem solving  it's functionally equivalent to turning on  Two and a Half Men  and calling it a day. In all seriousness. Here's an example from a physics textbook. It applies equally to math. Notice  first of all here  that you have exactly three pieces of information there  each of which will figure into a formula somewhere  eventually  which the student will then compute. I believe in real life. And ask yourself  what problem have you solved  ever  that was worth solving where you knew all of the given information in advance  where you didn't have a surplus of information and you had to filter it out  or you didn't have sufficient information and had to go find some. I'm sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that. And the textbook  I think  knows how it's hamstringing students because  watch this  this is the practice problem set. When it comes time to do the actual problem set  we have problems like this right here where we're just swapping out numbers and tweaking the context a little bit. And if the student still doesn't recognize the stamp this was molded from  it helpfully explains to you what sample problem you can return to to find the formula. You could literally  I mean this  pass this particular unit without knowing any physics  just knowing how to decode a textbook. That's a shame. So I can diagnose the problem a little more specifically in math. Here's a really cool problem. I like this. It's about defining steepness and slope using a ski lift. But what you have here is actually four separate layers  and I'm curious which of you can see the four separate layers and  particularly  how when they're compressed together and presented to the student all at once  how that creates this impatient problem solving. I'll define them here  You have the visual. You also have the mathematical structure  talking about grids  measurements  labels  points  axes  that sort of thing. You have substeps  which all lead to what we really want to talk about  which section is the steepest. So I hope you can see. I really hope you can see how what we're doing here is taking a compelling question  a compelling answer  but we're paving a smooth  straight path from one to the other and congratulating our students for how well they can step over the small cracks in the way. That's all we're doing here. So I want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way and build them up with students  we can have everything we're looking for in terms of patient problem solving. So right here I start with the visual  and I immediately ask the question  Which section is the steepest  And this starts conversation because the visual is created in such a way where you can defend two answers. So you get people arguing against each other  friend versus friend  in pairs  journaling  whatever. And then eventually we realize it's getting annoying to talk about the skier in the lower left hand side of the screen or the skier just above the mid line. And we realize how great would it be if we just had some A  B  C and D labels to talk about them more easily. And then as we start to define what does steepness mean  we realize it would be nice to have some measurements to really narrow it down  specifically what that means. And then and only then  we throw down that mathematical structure. The math serves the conversation  the conversation doesn't serve the math. And at that point  I'll put it to you that nine out of    classes are good to go on the whole slope  steepness thing. But if you need to  your students can then develop those substeps together. Do you guys see how this  right here  compared to that    which one creates that patient problem solving  that math reasoning  It's been obvious in my practice  to me. And I'll yield the floor here for a second to Einstein  who  I believe  has paid his dues. He talked about the formulation of a problem being so incredibly important  and yet in my practice  in the U.S. here  we just give problems to students  we don't involve them in the formulation of the problem. So    percent of what I do with my five hours of prep time per week is to take fairly compelling elements of problems like this from my textbook and rebuild them in a way that supports math reasoning and patient problem solving. And here's how it works. I like this question. It's about a water tank. The question is  How long will it take you to fill it up  First things first  we eliminate all the substeps. Students have to develop those  they have to formulate those. And then notice that all the information written on there is stuff you'll need. None of it's a distractor  so we lose that. Students need to decide   All right  well  does the height matter  Does the side of it matter  Does the color of the valve matter  What matters here   Such an underrepresented question in math curriculum. So now we have a water tank. How long will it take you to fill it up  And that's it. And because this is the   st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms  not in terms of line art or clip art that you so often see in textbooks  we go out and we take a picture of it. So now we have the real deal. How long will it take it to fill it up  And then even better is we take a video  a video of someone filling it up. And it's filling up slowly  agonizingly slowly. It's tedious. Students are looking at their watches  rolling their eyes  and they're all wondering at some point or another   Man  how long is it going to take to fill up   That's how you know you've baited the hook  right  And that question  off this right here  is really fun for me because  like the intro  I teach kids    because of my inexperience    I teach the kids that are the most remedial  all right  And I've got kids who will not join a conversation about math because someone else has the formula  someone else knows how to work the formula better than me  so I won't talk about it. But here  every student is on a level playing field of intuition. Everyone's filled something up with water before  so I get kids answering the question   How long will it take   I've got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated joining the conversation. We put names on the board  attach them to guesses  and kids have bought in here. And then we follow the process I've described. And the best part here  or one of the better parts is that we don't get our answer from the answer key in the back of the teacher's edition. We  instead  just watch the end of the movie. And that's terrifying  because the theoretical models that always work out in the answer key in the back of a teacher's edition  that's great  but it's scary to talk about sources of error when the theoretical does not match up with the practical. But those conversations have been so valuable  among the most valuable. So I'm here to report some really fun games with students who come pre installed with these viruses day one of the class. These are the kids who now  one semester in  I can put something on the board  totally new  totally foreign  and they'll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year  which is just so fun. We're no longer averse to word problems  because we've redefined what a word problem is. We're no longer intimidated by math  because we're slowly redefining what math is. This has been a lot of fun. I encourage math teachers I talk to to use multimedia  because it brings the real world into your classroom in high resolution and full color  to encourage student intuition for that level playing field  to ask the shortest question you possibly can and let those more specific questions come out in conversation  to let students build the problem  because Einstein said so  and to finally  in total  just be less helpful  because the textbook is helping you in all the wrong ways  It's buying you out of your obligation  for patient problem solving and math reasoning  to be less helpful. And why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now is because we have the tools to create this high quality curriculum in our front pocket. It's ubiquitous and fairly cheap  and the tools to distribute it freely under open licenses has also never been cheaper or more ubiquitous. I put a video series on my blog not so long ago and it got       views in two weeks. I get emails still from teachers in countries I've never visited saying   Wow  yeah. We had a good conversation about that. Oh  and by the way  here's how I made your stuff better   which  wow. I put this problem on my blog recently  In a grocery store  which line do you get into  the one that has one cart and    items or the line with four carts and three  five  two and one items. And the linear modeling involved in that was some good stuff for my classroom  but it eventually got me on  Good Morning America  a few weeks later  which is just bizarre  right  And from all of this  I can only conclude that people  not just students  are really hungry for this. Math makes sense of the world. Math is the vocabulary for your own intuition. So I just really encourage you  whatever your stake is in education    whether you're a student  parent  teacher  policy maker  whatever    insist on better math curriculum. We need more patient problem solvers. Thank you.  Applause  I have a daughter  Mulan. And when she was eight  last year  she was doing a report for school or she had some homework about frogs. And we were at this restaurant  and she said   So  basically  frogs lay eggs and the eggs turn into tadpoles  and tadpoles turn into frogs.  And I said   Yeah. You know  I'm not really up on my frog reproduction that much. It's the females  I think  that lay the eggs  and then the males fertilize them. And then they become tadpoles and frogs.  And she says   What  Only the females have eggs   And I said   Yeah.  And she goes   And what's this fertilizing   So I kind of said   Oh  it's this extra ingredient  you know  that you need to create a new frog from the mom and dad frog.   Laughter  And she said   Oh  so is that true for humans too   And I thought   Okay  here we go.  I didn't know it would happen so quick  at eight. I was trying to remember all the guidebooks  and all I could remember was   Only answer the question they're asking. Don't give any more information.   Laughter  So I said   Yes.  And she said   And where do  um  where do human women  like  where do women lay their eggs   And I said   Well  funny you should ask.  Laughter  We have evolved to have our own pond. We have our very own pond inside our bodies. And we lay our eggs there  we don't have to worry about other eggs or anything like that. It's our own pond. And that's how it happens.  And she goes   Then how do they get fertilized   And I said   Well  Men  through their penis  they fertilize the eggs by the sperm coming out. And you go through the woman's vagina.  And so we're just eating  and her jaw just drops  and she goes   Mom  Like  where you go to the bathroom   And I said   I know. I know.  That's how we evolved. It does seem odd. It is a little bit like having a waste treatment plant right next to an amusement park ... Bad zoning  but ...   Laughter  She's like   What   And she goes   But Mom  but men and women can't ever see each other naked  Mom. So how could that ever happen   And then I go   Well   and then I put my Margaret Mead hat on.  Human males and females develop a special bond  and when they're much older  much  much older than you  and they have a very special feeling  then they can be naked together.  And she said   Mom  have you done this before   And I said   Yes.  And she said   But Mom  you can't have kids.  Because she knows that I adopted her and that I can't have kids. And I said   Yes.  And she said   Well  you don't have to do that again.  And I said   ...  And then she said   But how does it happen when a man and woman are together  Like  how do they know that's the time  Mom  does the man just say  'Is now the time to take off my pants '  And I said   Yes.   That is exactly right. That's exactly how it happens.  So we're driving home and she's looking out the window  and she goes   Mom. What if two just people saw each other on the street  like a man and a woman  they just started doing it. Would that ever happen   And I said   Oh  no. Humans are so private. Oh ...  And then she goes   What if there was like a party  and there was just like a whole bunch of girls and a whole bunch of boys  and there was a bunch of men and women and they just started doing it  Mom  Would that ever happen   And I said   Oh  no  no. That's not how we do it.  Then we got home and we see the cat. And she goes   Mom  how do cats do it   And I go   Oh  it's the same. It's basically the same.  And then she got all caught up in the legs.  But how would the legs go  Mom  I don't understand the legs.  She goes   Mom  everyone can't do the splits.  And I go   I know  but the legs ...  and I'm probably like   The legs get worked out.  And she goes   But I just can't understand it.  So I go   You know  why don't we go on the Internet  and maybe we can see ... like on Wikipedia.   Laughter  So we go online  and we put in  cats mating.  And  unfortunately  on YouTube  there's many cats mating videos. And we watched them and I'm so thankful  because she's just like   Wow  This is so amazing.  She goes   What about dogs   So we put in dogs mating  and  you know  we're watching it  and she's totally absorbed. And then she goes   Mom  do you think they would have  on the Internet  any humans mating   And then I realized that I had taken my little eight year old's hand  and taken her right into Internet porn.  Laughter  And I looked into this trusting  loving face  and I said   Oh  no. That would never happen.  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm so happy to be here. Good afternoon. There's a medical revolution happening all around us  and it's one that's going to help us conquer some of society's most dreaded conditions  including cancer. The revolution is called angiogenesis  and it's based on the process that our bodies use to grow blood vessels. So why should we care about blood vessels  Well  the human body is literally packed with them           miles worth in a typical adult. End to end  that would form a line that would circle the earth twice. The smallest blood vessels are called capillaries. We've got    billion of them in our bodies. And these are the vessels of life  and as I'll show you  they can also be the vessels of death. Now  the remarkable thing about blood vessels is that they have this ability to adapt to whatever environment they're growing in. For example  in the liver  they form channels to detoxify the blood  in the lungs  they line air sacs for gas exchange. In muscle  they corkscrew  so that muscles can contract without cutting off circulation. And in nerves  they course along like power lines  keeping those nerves alive. We get most of these blood vessels when we're actually still in the womb. And what that means is that as adults  blood vessels don't normally grow. Except in a few special circumstances. In women  blood vessels grow every month  to build the lining of the uterus. During pregnancy  they form the placenta  which connects mom and baby. And after injury  blood vessels actually have to grow under the scab in order to heal a wound. And this is actually what it looks like  hundreds of blood vessels  all growing toward the center of the wound. So the body has the ability to regulate the amount of blood vessels that are present at any given time. It does this through an elaborate and elegant system of checks and balances  stimulators and inhibitors of angiogenesis  such that  when we need a brief burst of blood vessels  the body can do this by releasing stimulators  proteins called angiogenic factors  that act as natural fertilizer  and stimulate new blood vessels to sprout. When those excess vessels are no longer needed  the body prunes them back to baseline  using naturally occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis. There are other situations where we start beneath the baseline  and we need to grow more blood vessels  just to get back to normal levels    for example  after an injury    and the body can do that too  but only to that normal level  that set point. But what we now know  is that for a number of diseases  there are defects in the system  where the body can't prune back extra blood vessels  or can't grow enough new ones in the right place at the right time. And in these situations  angiogenesis is out of balance. And when angiogenesis is out of balance  a myriad of diseases result. For example  insufficient angiogenesis    not enough blood vessels    leads to wounds that don't heal  heart attacks  legs without circulation  death from stroke  nerve damage. And on the other end  excessive angiogenesis    too many blood vessels    drives disease  and we see this in cancer  blindness  arthritis  obesity  Alzheimer's disease. In total  there are more than    major diseases affecting more than a billion people worldwide  that all look on the surface to be different from one another  but all actually share abnormal angiogenesis as their common denominator. And this realization is allowing us to re conceptualize the way that we actually approach these diseases  by controlling angiogenesis. Now  I'm going to focus on cancer  because angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer    every type of cancer. So here we go. This is a tumor  dark  gray  ominous mass growing inside a brain. And under the microscope  you can see hundreds of these brown stained blood vessels  capillaries that are feeding cancer cells  bringing oxygen and nutrients. But cancers don't start out like this  and in fact  cancers don't start out with a blood supply. They start out as small  microscopic nests of cells  that can only grow to one half a cubic millimeter in size. That's the tip of a ballpoint pen. Then they can't get any larger because they don't have a blood supply  so they don't have enough oxygen or nutrients. In fact  we're probably forming these microscopic cancers all the time in our body. Autopsy studies from people who died in car accidents have shown that about    percent of women between the ages of    and    actually have microscopic cancers in their breasts. About    percent of men in their   s and   s have microscopic prostate cancers  and virtually     percent of us  by the time we reach our   s  will have microscopic cancers growing in our thyroid. Yet  without a blood supply  most of these cancers will never become dangerous. Dr. Judah Folkman  who was my mentor and who was the pioneer of the angiogenesis field  once called this  cancer without disease.  So the body's ability to balance angiogenesis  when it's working properly  prevents blood vessels from feeding cancers. And this turns out to be one of our most important defense mechanisms against cancer. In fact  if you actually block angiogenesis and prevent blood vessels from ever reaching cancer cells  tumors simply can't grow up. But once angiogenesis occurs  cancers can grow exponentially. And this is actually how a cancer goes from being harmless  to being deadly. Cancer cells mutate  and they gain the ability to release lots of those angiogenic factors  natural fertilizer  that tip the balance in favor of blood vessels invading the cancer. And once those vessels invade the cancer  it can expand  it can invade local tissues  and the same vessels that are feeding tumors allow cancer cells to exit into the circulation as metastases. And unfortunately  this late stage of cancer is the one at which it's most likely to be diagnosed  when angiogenesis is already turned on  and cancer cells are growing like wild. So  if angiogenesis is a tipping point between a harmless cancer and a harmful one  then one major part of the angiogenesis revolution is a new approach to treating cancer by cutting off the blood supply. We call this antiangiogenic therapy  and it's completely different from chemotherapy  because it selectively aims at the blood vessels that are feeding the cancers. We can do this because tumor blood vessels are unlike normal  healthy vessels we see in other places of the body    they're abnormal  they're very poorly constructed  and because of that  they're highly vulnerable to treatments that target them. In effect  when we give cancer patients antiangiogenic therapy    here  an experimental drug for a glioma  which is a type of brain tumor    you can see that there are dramatic changes that occur when the tumor is being starved. Here's a woman with a breast cancer  being treated with the antiangiogenic drug called Avastin  which is FDA approved. And you can see that the halo of blood flow disappears after treatment. Well  I've just shown you two very different types of cancer that both responded to antiangiogenic therapy. So a few years ago  I asked myself   Can we take this one step further and treat other cancers  even in other species   So here is a nine year old boxer named Milo  who had a very aggressive tumor called a malignant neurofibroma growing on his shoulder. It invaded into his lungs. His veterinarian only gave him three months to live. So we created a cocktail of antiangiogenic drugs that could be mixed into his dog food  as well as an antiangiogenic cream  that could be applied on the surface of the tumor. And within a few weeks of treatment  we were able to slow down that cancer's growth  such that we were ultimately able to extend Milo s survival to six times what the veterinarian had initially predicted  all with a very good quality of life. And we've subsequently treated more than     dogs. We have about a    percent response rate  and improved survival for these pets that were about to be euthanized. So let me show you a couple of even more interesting examples. This is    year old dolphin living in Florida  and she had these lesions in her mouth that  over the course of three years  developed into invasive squamous cell cancers. So we created an antiangiogenic paste. We had it painted on top of the cancer three times a week. And over the course of seven months  the cancers completely disappeared  and the biopsies came back as normal. Here's a cancer growing on the lip of a Quarter Horse named Guinness. It's a very  very deadly type of cancer called an angiosarcoma. It had already spread to his lymph nodes  so we used an antiangiogenic skin cream for the lip  and the oral cocktail  so we could treat from the inside as well as the outside. And over the course of six months  he experienced a complete remission. And here he is six years later  Guinness  with his very happy owner. Now obviously  antiangiogenic therapy could be used for a wide range of cancers. And in fact  the first pioneering treatments for people as well as dogs  are already becoming available. There are    different drugs     different cancer types. But the real question is  How well do these work in practice  So here's actually the patient survival data from eight different types of cancer. The bars represent survival time taken from the era in which there was only chemotherapy  or surgery  or radiation available. But starting in       when antiangiogenic therapies first became available  you can see that there has been a    to     percent improvement in survival for people with kidney cancer  multiple myeloma  colorectal cancer  and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. That's impressive. But for other tumors and cancer types  the improvements have only been modest. So I started asking myself   Why haven't we been able to do better   And the answer  to me  is obvious  we're treating cancer too late in the game  when it's already established  and oftentimes  it's already spread or metastasized. And as a doctor  I know that once a disease progresses to an advanced stage  achieving a cure can be difficult  if not impossible. So I went back to the biology of angiogenesis  and started thinking  Could the answer to cancer be preventing angiogenesis  beating cancer at its own game  so the cancers could never become dangerous  This could help healthy people  as well as people who've already beaten cancer once or twice  and want to find a way to keep it from coming back. So to look for a way to prevent angiogenesis in cancer  I went back to look at cancer's causes. And what really intrigued me  was when I saw that diet accounts for    to    percent of environmentally caused cancers. Now the obvious thing is to think about what we could remove from our diet  what to strip out  take away. But I actually took a completely opposite approach  and began asking  What could we be adding to our diet that's naturally antiangiogenic  and that could boost the body's defense system  and beat back those blood vessels that are feeding cancers  In other words  can we eat to starve cancer  Well  the answer is yes  and I'm going to show you how. And our search for this has taken us to the market  the farm and to the spice cabinet  because what we've discovered is that Mother Nature has laced a large number of foods and beverages and herbs with naturally occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis. Here's a test system we developed. At the center is a ring from which hundreds of blood vessels are growing out in a starburst fashion. And we can use this system to test dietary factors at concentrations that are obtainable by eating. Let me show you what happens when we put in an extract from red grapes. The active ingredient is resveratrol  it's also found in red wine. This inhibits abnormal angiogenesis  by    percent. Here's what happens when we added an extract from strawberries. It potently inhibits angiogenesis. And extract from soybeans. And here is a growing list of antiangiogenic foods and beverages that we're interested in studying. For each food type  we believe that there are different potencies within different strains and varietals. And we want to measure this because  well  while you're eating a strawberry or drinking tea  why not select the one that's most potent for preventing cancer  So here are four different teas that we've tested. They're all common ones  Chinese jasmine  Japanese sencha  Earl Grey and a special blend that we prepared  and you can see clearly that the teas vary in their potency  from less potent to more potent. But what's very cool is when we combine the two less potent teas together  the combination  the blend  is more potent than either one alone. This means there's food synergy. Here's some more data from our testing. Now in the lab  we can simulate tumor angiogenesis  represented here in a black bar. And using this system  we can test the potency of cancer drugs. So the shorter the bar  the less angiogenesis    that's good. And here are some common drugs that have been associated with reducing the risk of cancer in people. Statins  nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs  and a few others    they inhibit angiogenesis  too. And here are the dietary factors going head to head against these drugs. You can see they clearly hold their own  and in some cases  they're more potent than the actual drugs. Soy  parsley  garlic  grapes  berries. I could go home and cook a tasty meal using these ingredients. Imagine if we could create the world's first rating system  in which we could score foods according to their antiangiogenic  cancer preventative properties. And that's what we're doing right now. Now  I've shown you a bunch of lab data  and so the real question is  What is the evidence in people that eating certain foods can reduce angiogenesis in cancer  Well  the best example I know is a study of        men followed over    years  in which it was found that men who consumed cooked tomatoes two to three times a week  had up to a    percent reduction in their risk of developing prostate cancer. Now  we know that tomatoes are a good source of lycopene  and lycopene is antiangiogenic. But what's even more interesting from this study  is that in those men who did develop prostate cancer  those who ate more servings of tomato sauce  actually had fewer blood vessels feeding their cancer. So this human study is a prime example of how antiangiogenic substances present in food and consumed at practical levels  can have an impact on cancer. And we're now studying the role of a healthy diet    with Dean Ornish at UCSF and Tufts University    the role of this healthy diet on markers of angiogenesis that we can find in the bloodstream. Obviously  what I've shared with you has some far ranging implications  even beyond cancer research. Because if we're right  it could impact consumer education  food services  public health and even the insurance industry. And in fact  some insurance companies are already beginning to think along these lines. Check out this ad from BlueCross BlueShield of Minnesota. For many people around the world  dietary cancer prevention may be the only practical solution  because not everybody can afford expensive end stage cancer treatments  but everybody could benefit from a healthy diet based on local  sustainable  antiangiogenic crops. Now  finally  I've talked to you about food  and I've talked to you about cancer  so there's just one more disease that I have to tell you about  and that's obesity. Because it turns out that adipose tissue    fat    is highly angiogenesis dependent. And like a tumor  fat grows when blood vessels grow. So the question is  Can we shrink fat by cutting off its blood supply  The top curve shows the body weight of a genetically obese mouse that eats nonstop until it turns fat  like this furry tennis ball. And the bottom curve is the weight of a normal mouse. If you take the obese mouse and give it an angiogenesis inhibitor  it loses weight. Stop the treatment  gains the weight back. Restart the treatment  loses the weight. Stop the treatment  it gains the weight back. And  in fact  you can cycle the weight up and down simply by inhibiting angiogenesis. So this approach that we're taking for cancer prevention may also have an application for obesity. The truly interesting thing about this is that we can't take these obese mice and make them lose more weight than what the normal mouse's weight is supposed to be. In other words  we can't create supermodel mice. And this speaks to the role of angiogenesis in regulating healthy set points. Albert Szent Gy rgi once said   Discovery consists of seeing what everyone has seen  and thinking what no one has thought.  I hope I've convinced you that for diseases like cancer  obesity and other conditions  there may be a great power in attacking their common denominator  angiogenesis. And that's what I think the world needs now. Thank you. June Cohen  I have a quick question for you. JC  So these drugs aren't exactly in mainstream cancer treatments right now. For anyone out here who has cancer  what would you recommend  Do you recommend pursuing these treatments now  for most cancer patients  William Li  There are antiangiogenic treatments that are FDA approved  and if you're a cancer patient  or working for one or advocating for one  you should ask about them. And there are many clinical trials. The Angiogenesis Foundation is following almost     companies  and there are about     more drugs in that pipeline. So  consider the approved ones  look for clinical trials  but then between what the doctor can do for you  we need to start asking what can we do for ourselves. This is one of the themes I'm talking about  We can empower ourselves to do the things that doctors can't do for us  which is to use knowledge and take action. And if Mother Nature has given us some clues  we think there might be a new future in the value of how we eat  and what we eat is really our chemotherapy three times a day. JC  Right. And along those lines  for people who might have risk factors for cancer  would you recommend pursuing any treatments prophylactically  or simply pursuing the right diet  with lots of tomato sauce  WL  Well  you know  there's abundant epidemiological evidence  and I think in the information age  it doesn't take long to go to a credible source like PubMed  the National Library of Medicine  to look for epidemiological studies for cancer risk reduction based on diet and based on common medications. And that's certainly something that anybody can look into. JC  Okay. Well  thank you so much. About a year ago  I asked myself a question   Knowing what I know  why am I not a vegetarian   After all  I'm one of the green guys  I grew up with hippie parents in a log cabin. I started a site called TreeHugger    I care about this stuff. I knew that eating a mere hamburger a day can increase my risk of dying by a third. Cruelty  I knew that the    billion animals we raise each year for meat are raised in factory farm conditions that we  hypocritically  wouldn't even consider for our own cats  dogs and other pets. Environmentally  meat  amazingly  causes more emissions than all of transportation combined  cars  trains  planes  buses  boats  all of it. And beef production uses     times the water that most vegetables do. I also knew that I'm not alone. We as a society are eating twice as much meat as we did in the   s. So what was once the special little side treat now is the main  much more regular. So really  any of these angles should have been enough to convince me to go vegetarian. Yet  there I was    chk  chk  chk    tucking into a big old steak. So why was I stalling  I realized that what I was being pitched was a binary solution. It was either you're a meat eater or you're a vegetarian  and I guess I just wasn't quite ready. Imagine your last hamburger. So my common sense  my good intentions  were in conflict with my taste buds. And I'd commit to doing it later  and not surprisingly  later never came. Sound familiar  So I wondered  might there be a third solution  And I thought about it  and I came up with one. I've been doing it for the last year  and it's great. It's called weekday veg. The name says it all  Nothing with a face Monday through Friday. On the weekend  your choice. Simple. If you want to take it to the next level  remember  the major culprits in terms of environmental damage and health are red and processed meats. So you want to swap those out with some good  sustainably harvested fish. It's structured  so it ends up being simple to remember  and it's okay to break it here and there. After all  cutting five days a week is cutting    percent of your meat intake. The program has been great  weekday veg. My footprint's smaller  I'm lessening pollution  I feel better about the animals  I'm even saving money. Best of all  I'm healthier  I know that I'm going to live longer  and I've even lost a little weight. So  please ask yourselves  for your health  for your pocketbook  for the environment  for the animals  What's stopping you from giving weekday veg a shot  After all  if all of us ate half as much meat  it would be like half of us were vegetarians. Thank you. I want to talk about penguins today. But first  I want to start by saying that we need a new operating system  for the oceans and for the Earth. When I came to the Galapagos    years ago  there were       people that lived in the Galapagos. Now there are over       . There were two Jeeps on Santa Cruz. Now  there are around a thousand trucks and buses and cars there. So the fundamental problems that we face are overconsumption and too many people. It's the same problems in the Galapagos  except  obviously  it's worse here  in some ways  than other places. Because we've only doubled the population of the Earth since the     s    a little more than doubled    but we have  .  billion people in the world  and we all like to consume. And one of the major problems that we have is our operating system is not giving us the proper feedback. We're not paying the true environmental costs of our actions. And when I came at age    to live on Fernandina  let me just say  that I had never camped before. I had never lived alone for any period of time  and I'd never slept with sea lions snoring next to me all night. But moreover  I'd never lived on an uninhabited island. Punta Espinosa is where I lived for over a year  and we call it uninhabited because there are no people there. But it's alive with life  it's hardly uninhabited. So a lot has happened in the last    years  and what I learned when I came to the Galapagos is the importance of wild places  wild things  certainly wildlife  and the amazing qualities that penguins have. Penguins are real athletes  They can swim     kilometers in a day. They can swim at the same speed day and night    that's faster than any Olympic swimmer. I mean  they can do like seven kilometers an hour and sustain it. But what is really amazing  because of this deepness here  Emperor penguins can go down more than     meters and they can hold their breath for    minutes. Magellanic penguins  the ones that I work on  they can dive to about    meters and they can stay down for about  .  minutes. Humans  without fins     meters   .  minutes. And I doubt anybody in this room could really hold their breath for  .  minutes. You have to train to be able to do that. So penguins are amazing athletes. The other thing is  I've never met anybody that really doesn't say that they like penguins. They're comical  they walk upright  and  of course  they're diligent. And  more importantly  they're well dressed. So they have all the criteria that people normally like. But scientifically  they're amazing because they're sentinels. They tell us about our world in a lot of different ways  and particularly the ocean. This is a picture of a Galapagos penguin that's on the front of a little zodiac here in the Galapagos. And that's what I came to study. I thought I was going to study the social behavior of Galapagos penguins  but you already know penguins are rare. These are the rarest penguins in the world. Why I thought I was going to be able to do that  I don't know. But the population has changed dramatically since I was first here. When I counted penguins for the first time and tried to do a census  we just counted all the individual beaks that we could around all these islands. We counted around        so I don't know how many penguins there really are  but I know I can count      . If you go and do it now  the national parks count about    . So we have a quarter of the penguins that we did    years ago. And this is true of most of our living systems. We have less than we had before  and most of them are in fairly steep decline. And I want to just show you a little bit about why. That's a penguin braying to tell you that it's important to pay attention to penguins. Most important of all  I didn't know what that was the first time I heard it. And you can imagine sleeping on Fernandina your first night there and you hear this lonesome  plaintful call. I fell in love with penguins  and it certainly has changed the rest of my life. What I found out I was studying is really the difference in how the Galapagos changes  the most extreme variation. You've heard about these El Ninos  but this is the extreme that penguins all over the world have to adapt to. This is a cold water event called La Nina. Where it's blue and it's green  it means the water is really cold. And so you can see this current coming up    in this case  the Humboldt Current    that comes all the way out to the Galapagos Islands  and this deep undersea current  the Cromwell Current  that upwells around the Galapagos. That brings all the nutrients  When this is cold in the Galapagos  it's rich  and there's plenty of food for everyone. When we have extreme El Nino events  you see all this red  and you see no green out here around the Galapagos. That means that there's no upwelling  and there's basically no food. So it's a real desert for not only for the penguins and the sea lions and the marine iguanas ... things die when there's no food. But we didn't even know that that affected the Galapagos when I went to study penguins. And you can imagine being on an island hoping you're going to see penguins  and you're in the middle of an El Nino event and there are no penguins. They're not breeding  they're not even around. I studied marine iguanas at that point. But this is a global phenomenon  we know that. And if you look along the coast of Argentina  where I work now  at a place called Punta Tombo    the largest Magellanic penguin colony in the world down here about    degrees south latitude    you see that there's great variation here. Some years  the cold water goes all the way up to Brazil  and other years  in these La Nina years  it doesn't. So the oceans don't always act together  they act differently  but that is the kind of variation that penguins have to live with  and it's not easy. So when I went to study the Magellanic penguins  I didn't have any problems. There were plenty of them. This is a picture at Punta Tombo in February showing all the penguins along the beach. I went there because the Japanese wanted to start harvesting them and turning them into high fashion golf gloves  protein and oil. Fortunately  nobody has harvested any penguins and we're getting over         tourists a year to see them. But the population is declining and it's declined fairly substantially  about    percent since       when I started these surveys  in terms of number of active nests. Here  you can see where Punta Tombo is  and they breed in incredibly dense colonies. We know this because of long term science  because we have long term studies there. And science is important in informing decision makers  and also in changing how we do and knowing the direction of change that we're going in. And so we have this penguin project. The Wildlife Conservation Society has funded me along with a lot of individuals over the last    years to be able to produce these kinds of maps. And also  we know that it's not only Galapagos penguins that are in trouble  but Magellanics and many other species of penguins. And so we have started a global penguin society to try to focus on the real plight of penguins. This is one of the plights of penguins  oil pollution. Penguins don't like oil and they don't like to swim through oil. The nice thing is  if you look down here in Argentina  there's no surface oil pollution from this composite map. But  in fact  when we went to Argentina  penguins were often found totally covered in oil. So they were just minding their own business. They ended up swimming through ballast water that had oil in it. Because when tankers carry oil they have to have ballast at some point  so when they're empty  they have the ballast water in there. When they come back  they actually dump this oily ballast water into the ocean. Why do they do that  Because it's cheaper  because they don't pay the real environmental costs. We usually don't  and we want to start getting the accounting system right so we can pay the real cost. At first  the Argentine government said   No  there's no way. You can't find oiled penguins in Argentina. We have laws  and we can't have illegal dumping  it's against the law.  So we ended up spending nine years convincing the government that there were lots of oiled penguins. In some years  like this year  we found more than    percent of the adult penguins dead on the beach were covered in oil. These little blue dots are the fledglings    we do this survey every March    which means that they're only in the environment from January until March  so maybe three months at the most that they could get covered in oil. And you can see  in some years over    percent of the fledglings were oiled. Eventually  the government listened and  amazingly  they changed their laws. They moved the tanker lanes    kilometers farther off shore  and people are not doing as much illegal dumping. So what we're seeing now is very few penguins are oiled. Why are there even these penguins oiled  Because we've solved the problem in Chubut province  which is like a state in Argentina where Punta Tombo is    so that's about       kilometers of coastline    but we haven't solved the problem in northern Argentina  Uruguay and Brazil. So now I want to show you that penguins are affected. I'm just going to talk about two things. This is climate change. Now this has really been a fun study because I put satellite tags on the back of these Magellanic penguins. Try to convince donors to give you a couple thousand dollars to glue a satellite tag on the back of penguins. But we've been doing this now for more than a decade to learn where they go. We thought we needed a marine protected area of about    kilometers  and then we put a satellite tag on the back of a penguin. And what the penguins show us    and these are all the little dots from where the penguins' positions were for penguins in incubation in         and what you see is some of these individuals are going     kilometers away from their nests. So that means as their mate is sitting on the nest incubating the eggs  the other one is out there foraging  and the longer they have to stay gone  the worse condition the mate is in when the mate comes back. And  of course  all of this then leads to a vicious cycle and you can't raise a lot of chicks. Here you see in         these are all the dots of where the penguins are    they were raising a little over a half of a chick. Here  you can see in       they raised almost three quarters of a chick per nest  and you can see that they're closer to Punta Tombo  they're not going as far away. This past year  in       you can see that they're now raising about a fourth of a chick  and some of these individuals are going more than     kilometers away from their nests. So it's kind of like you having a job in Chicago  and then you get transferred to St. Louis  and your mate is not happy about this because you've got to pay airfare  because you're gone longer. The same thing's true for penguins as well. And they're going about  on average now     kilometers farther than they did a decade ago. We need to be able to get information out to the general public. And so we started a publication with the Society for Conservation that we think presents cutting edge science in a new  novel way  because we have reporters that are good writers that actually can distill the information and make it accessible to the general public. So if you're interested in cutting edge science and smarter conservation  you should join with our    partners    some of them here in this room  like the Nature Conservancy    and look at this magazine because we need to get information out about conservation to the general public. Lastly I want to say that all of you  probably  have had some relationship at some time in your life with a dog  a cat  some sort of pet  and you recognized that those are individuals. And some of you consider them almost part of your family. If you had a relationship with a penguin  you'd see it in the same sort of way. They're amazing creatures that really change how you view the world because they're not that different from us  They're trying to make a living  they're trying to raise their offspring  they're trying to get on and survive in the world. This is Turbo the Penguin. Turbo's never been fed. He met us and got his name because he started standing under my diesel truck  a turbo truck  so we named him Turbo. Turbo has taken to knocking on the door with his beak  we let him in and he comes in here. And I just wanted to show you what happened one day when Turbo brought in a friend. So this is Turbo. He's coming up to one of my graduate students and flipper patting  which he would do to a female penguin. And you can see  he's not trying to bite. This guy has never been in before and he's trying to figure out   What is going on  What is this guy doing  This is really pretty weird.  And you'll see soon that my graduate student ... and you see  Turbo's pretty intent on his flipper patting. And now he's looking at the other guy  saying   You are really weird.  And now look at this  not friendly. So penguins really differ in their personalities just like our dogs and our cats. We're also trying to collect our information and become more technologically literate. So we're trying to put that in computers in the field. And penguins are always involved in helping us or not helping us in one way or another. This is a radio frequency ID system. You put a little piece of rice in the foot of a penguin that has a barcode  so it tells you who it is. It walks over the pad  and you know who it is. Okay  so here are a few penguins coming in. See  this one's coming back to its nest. They're all coming in at this time  walking across there  just kind of leisurely coming in. Here's a female that's in a hurry. She's got food. She's really rushing back  because it's hot  to try to feed her chicks. And then there's another fellow that will leisurely come by. Look how fat he is. He's walking back to feed his chicks. Then I realize that they're playing king of the box. This is my box up here  and this is the system that works. You can see this penguin  he goes over  he looks at those wires  does not like that wire. He unplugs the wire  we have no data. So  they really are pretty amazing creatures. OK. Most important thing is  Only you can change yourself  and only you can change the world and make it better  for people as well as penguins. So  thank you very much.  Applause  For the next few minutes we're going to talk about energy  and it's going to be a bit of a varied talk. I'll try to spin a story about energy  and oil's a convenient starting place. The talk will be broadly about energy  but oil's a good place to start. And one of the reasons is this is remarkable stuff. You take about eight or so carbon atoms  about    hydrogen atoms  you put them together in exactly the right way and you get this marvelous liquid  very energy dense and very easy to refine into a number of very useful products and fuels. It's great stuff. Now  as far as it goes  there's a lot of oil out there in the world. Here's my little pocket map of where it's all located. A bigger one for you to look at. But this is it  this is the oil in the world. Geologists have a pretty good idea of where the oil is. This is about     trillion gallons of crude oil still to be developed and produced in the world today. Now  that's just one story about oil  and we could end it there and say   Well  oil's going to last forever because  well  there's just a lot of it.  But there's actually more to the story than that. Oh  by the way  if you think you're very far from some of this oil       meters below where you're all sitting is one of the largest producing oil fields in the world. Come talk to me about it  I'll fill in some of the details if you want. So  that's one of the stories of oil  there's just a lot of it. But what about oil  Where is it in the energy system  Here's a little snapshot of     years of oil  and it's been a dominant part of our energy system for most of those     years. Now  here's another little secret I'm going to tell you about  For the last    years  oil has been playing less and less of a role in global energy systems. There was one kind of peak oil in       when oil represented    percent of global energy supply. Now  it's about    percent. It's been declining and I believe it will continue to decline. Gasoline consumption in the U.S. probably peaked in      and is declining. So oil is playing a less significant role every year. And so     years ago  there was a peak oil  just like  in the     s  there was a peak coal  and a hundred years before that  there was a peak wood. This is a very important picture of the evolution of energy systems. And what's been taking up the slack in the last few decades  Well  a lot of natural gas and a little bit of nuclear  for starters. And what goes on in the future  Well  I think out ahead of us a few decades is peak gas  and beyond that  peak renewables. Now  I'll tell you another little  very important story about this picture. Now  I'm not pretending that energy use in total isn't increasing  it is    that's another part of the story. Come talk to me about it  we'll fill in some of the details    but there's a very important message here  This is     years of history  and for     years we've been systematically decarbonizing our energy system. Energy systems of the world becoming progressively    year on year  decade on decade  century on century    becoming less carbon intense. And that continues into the future with the renewables that we're developing today  reaching maybe    percent of primary energy by mid century. Now that might be the end of the story    Okay  we just replace it all with conventional renewables    but I think  actually  there's more to the story than that. And to tell the next part of the story    and this is looking out say      and beyond. What is the future of truly sustainable  carbon free energy  Well  we have to take a little excursion  and we'll start in central Texas. Here's a piece of limestone. I picked it up outside of Marble Falls  Texas. It's about     million years old. And it's just limestone  nothing really special about it. Now  here's a piece of chalk. I picked this up at MIT. It's a little younger. And it's different than this limestone  you can see that. You wouldn't build a building out of this stuff  and you wouldn't try to give a lecture and write on the chalkboard with this. Yeah  it's very different    no  it's not different. It's not different  it's the same stuff  calcium carbonate  calcium carbonate. What's different is how the molecules are put together. Now  if you think that's kind of neat  the story gets really neat right now. Off the coast of California comes this  It's an abalone shell. Now  millions of abalone every year make this shell. Oh  by the way  just in case you weren't already guessing  it's calcium carbonate. It's the same stuff as this and the same stuff as this. But it's not the same stuff  it's different. It's thousands of times  maybe       times tougher than this. And why  Because the lowly abalone is able to lay down the calcium carbonate crystals in layers  making this beautiful  iridescent mother of pearl. Very specialized material that the abalone self assembles  millions of abalone  all the time  every day  every year. This is pretty incredible stuff. All the same  what's different  How the molecules are put together. Now  what does this have to do with energy  Here's a piece of coal. And I'll suggest that this coal is about as exciting as this chalk. Now  whether we're talking about fuels or energy carriers  or perhaps novel materials for batteries or fuel cells  nature hasn't ever built those perfect materials yet because nature didn't need to. Nature didn't need to because  unlike the abalone shell  the survival of a species didn't depend on building those materials  until maybe now when it might just matter. So  when we think about the future of energy  imagine what would it be like if instead of this  we could build the energy equivalent of this just by rearranging the molecules differently. And so that is my story. The oil will never run out. It's not because we have a lot of it. It's not because we're going to build a bajillion windmills. It's because  well  thousands of years ago  people invented ideas    they had ideas  innovations  technology    and the Stone Age ended  not because we ran out of stones. It's ideas  it's innovation  it's technology that will end the age of oil  long before we run out of oil. Thank you very much. We're here today to announce the first synthetic cell  a cell made by starting with the digital code in the computer  building the chromosome from four bottles of chemicals  assembling that chromosome in yeast  transplanting it into a recipient bacterial cell and transforming that cell into a new bacterial species. So this is the first self replicating species that we've had on the planet whose parent is a computer. It also is the first species to have its own website encoded in its genetic code. But we'll talk more about the watermarks in a minute. This is a project that had its inception    years ago when our team then    we called the institute TIGR    was involved in sequencing the first two genomes in history. We did Haemophilus influenzae and then the smallest genome of a self replicating organism  that of Mycoplasma genitalium. And as soon as we had these two sequences we thought  if this is supposed to be the smallest genome of a self replicating species  could there be even a smaller genome  Could we understand the basis of cellular life at the genetic level  It's been a    year quest just to get to the starting point now to be able to answer those questions  because it's very difficult to eliminate multiple genes from a cell. You can only do them one at a time. We decided early on that we had to take a synthetic route  even though nobody had been there before  to see if we could synthesize a bacterial chromosome so we could actually vary the gene content to understand the essential genes for life. That started our    year quest to get here. But before we did the first experiments  we actually asked Art Caplan's team at the University of Pennsylvania to undertake a review of what the risks  the challenges  the ethics around creating new species in the laboratory were because it hadn't been done before. They spent about two years reviewing that independently and published their results in Science in     . Ham and I took two years off as a side project to sequence the human genome  but as soon as that was done we got back to the task at hand. In       we started a new institute  the Institute for Biological Energy Alternatives  where we set out two goals  One  to understand the impact of our technology on the environment  and how to understand the environment better  and two  to start down this process of making synthetic life to understand basic life. In       we published our first success. So Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison developed some new methods for making error free DNA at a small level. Our first task was a       letter code bacteriophage  a virus that attacks only E. coli. So that was the phage phi X      which was chosen for historical reasons. It was the first DNA phage  DNA virus  DNA genome that was actually sequenced. So once we realized that we could make       base pair viral sized pieces  we thought  we at least have the means then to try and make serially lots of these pieces to be able to eventually assemble them together to make this mega base chromosome. So  substantially larger than we even thought we would go initially. There were several steps to this. There were two sides  We had to solve the chemistry for making large DNA molecules  and we had to solve the biological side of how  if we had this new chemical entity  how would we boot it up  activate it in a recipient cell. We had two teams working in parallel  one team on the chemistry  and the other on trying to be able to transplant entire chromosomes to get new cells. When we started this out  we thought the synthesis would be the biggest problem  which is why we chose the smallest genome. And some of you have noticed that we switched from the smallest genome to a much larger one. And we can walk through the reasons for that  but basically the small cell took on the order of one to two months to get results from  whereas the larger  faster growing cell takes only two days. So there's only so many cycles we could go through in a year at six weeks per cycle. And you should know that basically     probably    percent plus of our experiments failed. So this was a debugging  problem solving scenario from the beginning because there was no recipe of how to get there. So  one of the most important publications we had was in     . Carole Lartigue led the effort to actually transplant a bacterial chromosome from one bacteria to another. I think philosophically  that was one of the most important papers that we've ever done because it showed how dynamic life was. And we knew  once that worked  that we actually had a chance if we could make the synthetic chromosomes to do the same with those. We didn't know that it was going to take us several years more to get there. In       we reported the complete synthesis of the Mycoplasma genitalium genome  a little over         letters of genetic code  but we have not yet succeeded in booting up that chromosome. We think in part  because of its slow growth and  in part  cells have all kinds of unique defense mechanisms to keep these events from happening. It turned out the cell that we were trying to transplant into had a nuclease  an enzyme that chews up DNA on its surface  and was happy to eat the synthetic DNA that we gave it and never got transplantations. But at the time  that was the largest molecule of a defined structure that had been made. And so both sides were progressing  but part of the synthesis had to be accomplished or was able to be accomplished using yeast  putting the fragments in yeast and yeast would assemble these for us. It's an amazing step forward  but we had a problem because now we had the bacterial chromosomes growing in yeast. So in addition to doing the transplant  we had to find out how to get a bacterial chromosome out of the eukaryotic yeast into a form where we could transplant it into a recipient cell. So our team developed new techniques for actually growing  cloning entire bacterial chromosomes in yeast. So we took the same mycoides genome that Carole had initially transplanted  and we grew that in yeast as an artificial chromosome. And we thought this would be a great test bed for learning how to get chromosomes out of yeast and transplant them. When we did these experiments  though  we could get the chromosome out of yeast but it wouldn't transplant and boot up a cell. That little issue took the team two years to solve. It turns out  the DNA in the bacterial cell was actually methylated  and the methylation protects it from the restriction enzyme  from digesting the DNA. So what we found is if we took the chromosome out of yeast and methylated it  we could then transplant it. Further advances came when the team removed the restriction enzyme genes from the recipient capricolum cell. And once we had done that  now we can take naked DNA out of yeast and transplant it. So last fall when we published the results of that work in Science  we all became overconfident and were sure we were only a few weeks away from being able to now boot up a chromosome out of yeast. Because of the problems with Mycoplasma genitalium and its slow growth about a year and a half ago  we decided to synthesize the much larger chromosome  the mycoides chromosome  knowing that we had the biology worked out on that for transplantation. And Dan led the team for the synthesis of this over one million base pair chromosome. But it turned out it wasn't going to be as simple in the end  and it set us back three months because we had one error out of over a million base pairs in that sequence. So the team developed new debugging software  where we could test each synthetic fragment to see if it would grow in a background of wild type DNA. And we found that    out of the            base pair pieces we synthesized were completely accurate and compatible with a life forming sequence. We narrowed it down to one fragment  we sequenced it and found just one base pair had been deleted in an essential gene. So accuracy is essential. There's parts of the genome where it cannot tolerate even a single error  and then there's parts of the genome where we can put in large blocks of DNA  as we did with the watermarks  and it can tolerate all kinds of errors. So it took about three months to find that error and repair it. And then early one morning  at   a.m. we got a text from Dan saying that  now  the first blue colonies existed. So  it's been a long route to get here     years from the beginning. We felt one of the tenets of this field was to make absolutely certain we could distinguish synthetic DNA from natural DNA. Early on  when you're working in a new area of science  you have to think about all the pitfalls and things that could lead you to believe that you had done something when you hadn't  and  even worse  leading others to believe it. So  we thought the worst problem would be a single molecule contamination of the native chromosome  leading us to believe that we actually had created a synthetic cell  when it would have been just a contaminant. So early on  we developed the notion of putting in watermarks in the DNA to absolutely make clear that the DNA was synthetic. And the first chromosome we built in         the         base pair one    we simply assigned the names of the authors of the chromosome into the genetic code  but it was using just amino acid single letter translations  which leaves out certain letters of the alphabet. So the team actually developed a new code within the code within the code. So it's a new code for interpreting and writing messages in DNA. Now  mathematicians have been hiding and writing messages in the genetic code for a long time  but it's clear they were mathematicians and not biologists because  if you write long messages with the code that the mathematicians developed  it would more than likely lead to new proteins being synthesized with unknown functions. So the code that Mike Montague and the team developed actually puts frequent stop codons  so it's a different alphabet but allows us to use the entire English alphabet with punctuation and numbers. So  there are four major watermarks all over       base pairs of genetic code. The first one actually contains within it this code for interpreting the rest of the genetic code. So in the remaining information  in the watermarks  contain the names of  I think it's    different authors and key contributors to getting the project to this stage. And we also built in a website address so that if somebody decodes the code within the code within the code  they can send an email to that address. So it's clearly distinguishable from any other species  having    names in it  its own web address. And we added three quotations  because with the first genome we were criticized for not trying to say something more profound than just signing the work. So we won't give the rest of the code  but we will give the three quotations. The first is   To live  to err  to fall  to triumph and to recreate life out of life.  It's a James Joyce quote. The second quotation is   See things not as they are  but as they might be.  It's a quote from the  American Prometheus  book on Robert Oppenheimer. And the last one is a Richard Feynman quote   What I cannot build  I cannot understand.  So  because this is as much a philosophical advance as a technical advance in science  we tried to deal with both the philosophical and the technical side. The last thing I want to say before turning it over to questions is that the extensive work that we've done    asking for ethical review  pushing the envelope on that side as well as the technical side    this has been broadly discussed in the scientific community  in the policy community and at the highest levels of the federal government. Even with this announcement  as we did in         that work was funded by the Department of Energy  so the work was reviewed at the level of the White House  trying to decide whether to classify the work or publish it. And they came down on the side of open publication  which is the right approach    we've briefed the White House  we've briefed members of Congress  we've tried to take and push the policy issues in parallel with the scientific advances. So with that  I would like to open it first to the floor for questions. Yes  in the back. Reporter  Could you explain  in layman's terms  how significant a breakthrough this is please  Craig Venter  Can we explain how significant this is  I'm not sure we're the ones that should be explaining how significant it is. It's significant to us. Perhaps it's a giant philosophical change in how we view life. We actually view it as a baby step in terms of  it's taken us    years to be able to do the experiment we wanted to do    years ago on understanding life at its basic level. But we actually believe this is going to be a very powerful set of tools and we're already starting in numerous avenues to use this tool. We have  at the Institute  ongoing funding now from NIH in a program with Novartis to try and use these new synthetic DNA tools to perhaps make the flu vaccine that you might get next year. Because instead of taking weeks to months to make these  Dan's team can now make these in less than    hours. So when you see how long it took to get an H N  vaccine out  we think we can shorten that process quite substantially. In the vaccine area  Synthetic Genomics and the Institute are forming a new vaccine company because we think these tools can affect vaccines to diseases that haven't been possible to date  things where the viruses rapidly evolve  such with rhinovirus. Wouldn't it be nice to have something that actually blocked common colds  Or  more importantly  HIV  where the virus evolves so quickly the vaccines that are made today can't keep up with those evolutionary changes. Also  at Synthetic Genomics  we've been working on major environmental issues. I think this latest oil spill in the Gulf is a reminder. We can't see CO     we depend on scientific measurements for it and we see the beginning results of having too much of it    but we can see pre CO  now floating on the waters and contaminating the beaches in the Gulf. We need some alternatives for oil. We have a program with Exxon Mobile to try and develop new strains of algae that can efficiently capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or from concentrated sources  make new hydrocarbons that can go into their refineries to make normal gasoline and diesel fuel out of CO . Those are just a couple of the approaches and directions that we're taking. I was here four years ago  and I remember  at the time  that the talks weren't put online. I think they were given to TEDsters in a box  a box set of DVDs  which they put on their shelves  where they are now. And actually  Chris called me a week after I'd given my talk  and said   We're going to start putting them online. Can we put yours online   And I said   Sure.  And four years later  it's been downloaded four million times. So I suppose you could multiply that by    or something to get the number of people who've seen it. And  as Chris says  there is a hunger for videos of me. Don't you feel  So  this whole event has been an elaborate build up to me doing another one for you  so here it is. Al Gore spoke at the TED conference I spoke at four years ago and talked about the climate crisis. And I referenced that at the end of my last talk. So I want to pick up from there because I only had    minutes  frankly. So  as I was saying    You see  he's right. I mean  there is a major climate crisis  obviously  and I think if people don't believe it  they should get out more. But I believe there is a second climate crisis  which is as severe  which has the same origins  and that we have to deal with with the same urgency. And you may say  by the way   Look  I'm good. I have one climate crisis  I don't really need the second one.  But this is a crisis of  not natural resources    though I believe that's true    but a crisis of human resources. I believe fundamentally  as many speakers have said during the past few days  that we make very poor use of our talents. Very many people go through their whole lives having no real sense of what their talents may be  or if they have any to speak of. I meet all kinds of people who don't think they're really good at anything. Actually  I kind of divide the world into two groups now. Jeremy Bentham  the great utilitarian philosopher  once spiked this argument. He said   There are two types of people in this world  those who divide the world into two types and those who do not.  Well  I do. I meet all kinds of people who don't enjoy what they do. They simply go through their lives getting on with it. They get no great pleasure from what they do. They endure it rather than enjoy it  and wait for the weekend. But I also meet people who love what they do and couldn't imagine doing anything else. If you said   Don't do this anymore   they'd wonder what you're talking about. It isn't what they do  it's who they are. They say   But this is me  you know. It would be foolish to abandon this  because it speaks to my most authentic self.  And it's not true of enough people. In fact  on the contrary  I think it's still true of a minority of people. And I think there are many possible explanations for it. And high among them is education  because education  in a way  dislocates very many people from their natural talents. And human resources are like natural resources  they're often buried deep. You have to go looking for them  they're not just lying around on the surface. You have to create the circumstances where they show themselves. And you might imagine education would be the way that happens  but too often  it's not. Every education system in the world is being reformed at the moment and it's not enough. Reform is no use anymore  because that's simply improving a broken model. What we need    and the word's been used many times in the past few days    is not evolution  but a revolution in education. This has to be transformed into something else. One of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally in education. Innovation is hard  because it means doing something that people don't find very easy  for the most part. It means challenging what we take for granted  things that we think are obvious. The great problem for reform or transformation is the tyranny of common sense. Things that people think   It can't be done differently  that's how it's done.  I came across a great quote recently from Abraham Lincoln  who I thought you'd be pleased to have quoted at this point. He said this in December      to the second annual meeting of Congress. I ought to explain that I have no idea what was happening at the time. We don't teach American history in Britain. We suppress it. You know  this is our policy. No doubt  something fascinating was happening then  which the Americans among us will be aware of. But he said this   The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty  and we must rise with the occasion.  I love that. Not rise to it  rise with it.  As our case is new  so we must think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves  and then we shall save our country.  I love that word   disenthrall.  You know what it means  That there are ideas that all of us are enthralled to  which we simply take for granted as the natural order of things  the way things are. And many of our ideas have been formed  not to meet the circumstances of this century  but to cope with the circumstances of previous centuries. But our minds are still hypnotized by them  and we have to disenthrall ourselves of some of them. Now  doing this is easier said than done. It's very hard to know  by the way  what it is you take for granted. And the reason is that you take it for granted. Let me ask you something you may take for granted. How many of you here are over the age of     That's not what you take for granted  I'm sure you're familiar with that. Are there any people here under the age of     Great. Now  those over     could you put your hands up if you're wearing your wristwatch  Now that's a great deal of us  isn't it  Ask a room full of teenagers the same thing. Teenagers do not wear wristwatches. I don't mean they can't  they just often choose not to. And the reason is we were brought up in a pre digital culture  those of us over   . And so for us  if you want to know the time  you have to wear something to tell it. Kids now live in a world which is digitized  and the time  for them  is everywhere. They see no reason to do this. And by the way  you don't need either  it's just that you've always done it and you carry on doing it. My daughter never wears a watch  my daughter Kate  who's   . She doesn't see the point. As she says   It's a single function device.   Like  how lame is that   And I say   No  no  it tells the date as well.   It has multiple functions.  But  you see  there are things we're enthralled to in education. A couple of examples. One of them is the idea of linearity  that it starts here and you go through a track and if you do everything right  you will end up set for the rest of your life. Everybody who's spoken at TED has told us implicitly  or sometimes explicitly  a different story  that life is not linear  it's organic. We create our lives symbiotically as we explore our talents in relation to the circumstances they help to create for us. But  you know  we have become obsessed with this linear narrative. And probably the pinnacle for education is getting you to college. I think we are obsessed with getting people to college. Certain sorts of college. I don't mean you shouldn't go  but not everybody needs to go  or go now. Maybe they go later  not right away. And I was up in San Francisco a while ago doing a book signing. There was this guy buying a book  he was in his   s. I said   What do you do   And he said   I'm a fireman.  I asked   How long have you been a fireman    Always. I've always been a fireman.   Well  when did you decide   He said   As a kid. Actually  it was a problem for me at school  because at school  everybody wanted to be a fireman.  He said   But I wanted to be a fireman.  And he said   When I got to the senior year of school  my teachers didn't take it seriously. This one teacher didn't take it seriously. He said I was throwing my life away if that's all I chose to do with it  that I should go to college  I should become a professional person  that I had great potential and I was wasting my talent to do that.  He said   It was humiliating. It was in front of the whole class and I felt dreadful. But it's what I wanted  and as soon as I left school  I applied to the fire service and I was accepted. You know  I was thinking about that guy recently  just a few minutes ago when you were speaking  about this teacher  because six months ago  I saved his life.  He said   He was in a car wreck  and I pulled him out  gave him CPR  and I saved his wife's life as well.  He said   I think he thinks better of me now.  You know  to me  human communities depend upon a diversity of talent  not a singular conception of ability. And at the heart of our challenges    At the heart of the challenge is to reconstitute our sense of ability and of intelligence. This linearity thing is a problem. When I arrived in L.A. about nine years ago  I came across a policy statement    very well intentioned    which said   College begins in kindergarten.  No  it doesn't. It doesn't. If we had time  I could go into this  but we don't. Kindergarten begins in kindergarten. A friend of mine once said   A three year old is not half a six year old.  They're three. But as we just heard in this last session  there's such competition now to get into kindergarten    to get to the right kindergarten    that people are being interviewed for it at three. Kids sitting in front of unimpressed panels  you know  with their resumes    Flicking through and saying   What  this is it    You've been around for    months  and this is it    You've achieved nothing    commit. Spent the first six months breastfeeding  I can see.  See  it's outrageous as a conception. The other big issue is conformity. We have built our education systems on the model of fast food. This is something Jamie Oliver talked about the other day. There are two models of quality assurance in catering. One is fast food  where everything is standardized. The other is like Zagat and Michelin restaurants  where everything is not standardized  they're customized to local circumstances. And we have sold ourselves into a fast food model of education  and it's impoverishing our spirit and our energies as much as fast food is depleting our physical bodies. We have to recognize a couple of things here. One is that human talent is tremendously diverse. People have very different aptitudes. I worked out recently that I was given a guitar as a kid at about the same time that Eric Clapton got his first guitar. It worked out for Eric  that's all I'm saying. In a way    it did not for me. I could not get this thing to work no matter how often or how hard I blew into it. It just wouldn't work. But it's not only about that. It's about passion. Often  people are good at things they don't really care for. It's about passion  and what excites our spirit and our energy. And if you're doing the thing that you love to do  that you're good at  time takes a different course entirely. My wife's just finished writing a novel  and I think it's a great book  but she disappears for hours on end. You know this  if you're doing something you love  an hour feels like five minutes. If you're doing something that doesn't resonate with your spirit  five minutes feels like an hour. And the reason so many people are opting out of education is because it doesn't feed their spirit  it doesn't feed their energy or their passion. So I think we have to change metaphors. We have to go from what is essentially an industrial model of education  a manufacturing model  which is based on linearity and conformity and batching people. We have to move to a model that is based more on principles of agriculture. We have to recognize that human flourishing is not a mechanical process  it's an organic process. And you cannot predict the outcome of human development. All you can do  like a farmer  is create the conditions under which they will begin to flourish. So when we look at reforming education and transforming it  it isn't like cloning a system. There are great ones  like KIPP's  it's a great system. There are many great models. It's about customizing to your circumstances and personalizing education to the people you're actually teaching. And doing that  I think  is the answer to the future because it's not about scaling a new solution  it's about creating a movement in education in which people develop their own solutions  but with external support based on a personalized curriculum. Now in this room  there are people who represent extraordinary resources in business  in multimedia  in the Internet. These technologies  combined with the extraordinary talents of teachers  provide an opportunity to revolutionize education. And I urge you to get involved in it because it's vital  not just to ourselves  but to the future of our children. But we have to change from the industrial model to an agricultural model  where each school can be flourishing tomorrow. That's where children experience life. Or at home  if that's what they choose  to be educated with their families or friends. There's been a lot of talk about dreams over the course of these few days. And I wanted to just very quickly    I was very struck by Natalie Merchant's songs last night  recovering old poems. I wanted to read you a quick  very short poem from W. B. Yeats  who some of you may know. He wrote this to his love  Maud Gonne  and he was bewailing the fact that he couldn't really give her what he thought she wanted from him. And he says   I've got something else  but it may not be for you.  He says this   Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths  Enwrought with gold and silver light  The blue and the dim and the dark cloths Of night and light and the half light  I would spread the cloths under your feet  But I  being poor  have only my dreams  I have spread my dreams under your feet  Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.  And every day  everywhere  our children spread their dreams beneath our feet. And we should tread softly. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. I heard this amazing story about Miuccia Prada. She's an Italian fashion designer. She goes to this vintage store in Paris with a friend of hers. She's rooting around  she finds this one jacket by Balenciaga    she loves it. She's turning it inside out. She's looking at the seams. She's looking at the construction. Her friend says   Buy it already.  She said   I'll buy it  but I'm also going to replicate it.  Now  the academics in this audience may think   Well  that sounds like plagiarism.  But to a fashionista  what it really is is a sign of Prada's genius  that she can root through the history of fashion and pick the one jacket that doesn't need to be changed by one iota  and to be current and to be now. You might also be asking whether it's possible that this is illegal for her to do this. Well  it turns out that it's actually not illegal. In the fashion industry  there's very little intellectual property protection. They have trademark protection  but no copyright protection and no patent protection to speak of. All they have  really  is trademark protection  and so it means that anybody could copy any garment on any person in this room and sell it as their own design. The only thing that they can't copy is the actual trademark label within that piece of apparel. That's one reason that you see logos splattered all over these products. It's because it's a lot harder for knock off artists to knock off these designs because they can't knock off the logo. But if you go to Santee Alley  yeah. Canal Street  I know. And sometimes these are fun  right  Now  the reason for this  the reason that the fashion industry doesn't have any copyright protection is because the courts decided long ago that apparel is too utilitarian to qualify for copyright protection. They didn't want a handful of designers owning the seminal building blocks of our clothing. And then everybody else would have to license this cuff or this sleeve because Joe Blow owns it. But too utilitarian  I mean is that the way you think of fashion  This is Vivienne Westwood. No  We think of it as maybe too silly  too unnecessary. Now  those of you who are familiar with the logic behind copyright protection    which is that without ownership  there is no incentive to innovate    might be really surprised by both the critical success of the fashion industry and the economic success of this industry. What I'm going to argue today is that because there's no copyright protection in the fashion industry  fashion designers have actually been able to elevate utilitarian design  things to cover our naked bodies  into something that we consider art. Because there's no copyright protection in this industry  there's a very open and creative ecology of creativity. Unlike their creative brothers and sisters  who are sculptors or photographers or filmmakers or musicians  fashion designers can sample from all their peers' designs. They can take any element from any garment from the history of fashion and incorporate it into their own design. They're also notorious for riffing off of the zeitgeist. And here  I suspect  they were influenced by the costumes in Avatar. Maybe just a little. Can't copyright a costume either. Now  fashion designers have the broadest palette imaginable in this creative industry. This wedding dress here is actually made of sporks  and this dress is actually made of aluminum. I've heard this dress actually sort of sounds like wind chimes as they walk through. So  one of the magical side effects of having a culture of copying  which is really what it is  is the establishment of trends. People think this is a magical thing. How does it happen  Well  it's because it's legal for people to copy one another. Some people believe that there are a few people at the top of the fashion food chain who sort of dictate to us what we're all going to wear  but if you talk to any designer at any level  including these high end designers  they always say their main inspiration comes from the street  where people like you and me remix and match our own fashion looks. And that's where they really get a lot of their creative inspiration  so it's both a top down and a bottom up kind of industry. Now  the fast fashion giants have probably benefited the most from the lack of copyright protection in the fashion industry. They are notorious for knocking off high end designs and selling them at very low prices. And they've been faced with a lot of lawsuits  but those lawsuits are usually not won by fashion designers. The courts have said over and over again   You don't need any more intellectual property protection.  When you look at copies like this  you wonder  How do the luxury high end brands remain in business  If you can get it for     bucks  why pay a thousand  Well  that's one reason we had a conference here at USC a few years ago. We invited Tom Ford to come    the conference was called   Ready to Share  Fashion and the Ownership of Creativity     and we asked him exactly this question. Here's what he had to say. He had just come off a successful stint as the lead designer at Gucci  in case you didn't know. Tom Ford  And we found after much research that    actually not much research  quite simple research    that the counterfeit customer was not our customer. Johanna Blakley  Imagine that. The people on Santee Alley are not the ones who shop at Gucci. This is a very different demographic. And  you know  a knock off is never the same as an original high end design  at least in terms of the materials  they're always made of cheaper materials. But even sometimes a cheaper version can actually have some charming aspects  can breathe a little extra life into a dying trend. There's lots of virtues of copying. One that a lot of cultural critics have pointed to is that we now have a much broader palette of design choices to choose from than we ever have before  and this is mainly because of the fast fashion industry  actually. And this is a good thing. We need lots of options. Fashion  whether you like it or not  helps you project who you are to the world. Because of fast fashion  global trends actually get established much more quickly than they used to. And this  actually  is good news to trendsetters  they want trends to be set so that they can move product. For fashionistas  they want to stay ahead of the curve. They don't want to be wearing what everybody else is wearing. And so  they want to move on to the next trend as soon as possible. I tell you  there is no rest for the fashionable. Every season  these designers have to struggle to come up with the new fabulous idea that everybody's going to love. And this  let me tell you  is very good for the bottom line. Now of course  there's a bunch of effects that this culture of copying has on the creative process. And Stuart Weitzman is a very successful shoe designer. He has complained a lot about people copying him  but in one interview I read  he said it has really forced him to up his game. He had to come up with new ideas  new things that would be hard to copy. He came up with this Bowden wedge heel that has to be made out of steel or titanium  if you make it from some sort of cheaper material  it'll actually crack in two. It forced him to be a little more innovative.  Music  And that actually reminded me of jazz great  Charlie Parker. I don't know if you've heard this anecdote  but I have. He said that one of the reasons he invented bebop was that he was pretty sure that white musicians wouldn't be able to replicate the sound.  Laughter  He wanted to make it too difficult to copy  and that's what fashion designers are doing all the time. They're trying to put together a signature look  an aesthetic that reflects who they are. When people knock it off  everybody knows because they've put that look out on the runway  and it's a coherent aesthetic. I love these Gallianos. Okay  we'll move on.  Laughter  This is not unlike the world of comedy. I don't know if you know that jokes also can't be copyright protected. So when one liners were really popular  everybody stole them from one another. But now  we have a different kind of comic. They develop a persona  a signature style  much like fashion designers. And their jokes  much like the fashion designs by a fashion designer  really only work within that aesthetic. If somebody steals a joke from Larry David  for instance  it's not as funny. Now  the other thing that fashion designers have done to survive in this culture of copying is they've learned how to copy themselves. They knock themselves off. They make deals with the fast fashion giants and they come up with a way to sell their product to a whole new demographic  the Santee Alley demographic. Now  some fashion designers will say   It's only in the United States that we don't have any respect. In other countries there is protection for our artful designs.  But if you take a look at the two other biggest markets in the world  it turns out that the protection that's offered is really ineffectual. In Japan  for instance  which I think is the third largest market  they have a design law  it protects apparel  but the novelty standard is so high  you have to prove that your garment has never existed before  it's totally unique. And that's sort of like the novelty standard for a U.S. patent  which fashion designers never get    rarely get here in the states. In the European Union  they went in the other direction. Very low novelty standard  anybody can register anything. But even though it's the home of the fast fashion industry and you have a lot of luxury designers there  they don't register their garments  generally  and there's not a lot of litigation. It turns out it's because the novelty standard is too low. A person can come in and take somebody else's gown  cut off three inches from the bottom  go to the E.U. and register it as a new  original design. So  that does not stop the knock off artists. If you look at the registry  actually  a lot of the registered things in the E.U. are Nike T shirts that are almost identical to one another. But this has not stopped Diane von Furstenberg. She is the head of the Council of Fashion Designers of America  and she has told her constituency that she is going to get copyright protection for fashion designs. The retailers have kind of quashed this notion though. I don't think the legislation is going anywhere  because they realized it is so hard to tell the difference between a pirated design and something that's just part of a global trend. Who owns a look  That is a very difficult question to answer. It takes lots of lawyers and lots of court time  and the retailers decided that would be way too expensive. You know  it's not just the fashion industry that doesn't have copyright protection. There's a bunch of other industries that don't have copyright protection  including the food industry. You cannot copyright a recipe because it's a set of instructions  it's fact  and you cannot copyright the look and feel of even the most unique dish. Same with automobiles. It doesn't matter how wacky they look or how cool they look  you cannot copyright the sculptural design. It's a utilitarian article  that's why. Same with furniture  it's too utilitarian. Magic tricks  I think they're instructions  sort of like recipes  no copyright protection. Hairdos  no copyright protection. Open source software  these guys decided they didn't want copyright protection. They thought it'd be more innovative without it. It's really hard to get copyright for databases. Tattoo artists  they don't want it  it's not cool. They share their designs. Jokes  no copyright protection. Fireworks displays  the rules of games  the smell of perfume  no. And some of these industries may seem sort of marginal to you  but these are the gross sales for low I.P. industries  industries with very little copyright protection  and there's the gross sales of films and books. It ain't pretty. So you talk to people in the fashion industry and they're like   Shhh  Don't tell anybody we can actually steal from each other's designs. It's embarrassing.  But you know what  It's revolutionary  and it's a model that a lot of other industries    like the ones we just saw with the really small bars    they might have to think about this. Because right now  those industries with a lot of copyright protection are operating in an atmosphere where it's as if they don't have any protection  and they don't know what to do. When I found out that there are a whole bunch of industries that didn't have copyright protection  I thought   What exactly is the underlying logic  I want a picture.  And the lawyers do not provide a picture  so I made one. These are the two main sort of binary oppositions within the logic of copyright law. It is more complex than this  but this will do. First  Is something an artistic object  Then it deserves protection. Is it a utilitarian object  Then no  it does not deserve protection. This is a difficult  unstable binary. The other one is  Is it an idea  Is it something that needs to freely circulate in a free society  No protection. Or is it a physically fixed expression of an idea  something that somebody made and they deserve to own it for a while and make money from it  The problem is that digital technology has completely subverted the logic of this physically fixed  expression versus idea concept. Nowadays  we don't really recognize a book as something that sits on our shelf or music as something that is a physical object that we can hold. It's a digital file. It is barely tethered to any sort of physical reality in our minds. And these things  because we can copy and transmit them so easily  actually circulate within our culture a lot more like ideas than like physically instantiated objects. Now  the conceptual issues are truly profound when you talk about creativity and ownership and  let me tell you  we don't want to leave this just to lawyers to figure out. They're smart. I'm with one. He's my boyfriend  he's okay. He's smart  he's smart. But you want an interdisciplinary team of people hashing this out  trying to figure out  What is the kind of ownership model  in a digital world  that's going to lead to the most innovation  And my suggestion is that fashion might be a really good place to start looking for a model for creative industries in the future.

Thank you so much.  Applause  Today  I want you to look at children who become suicide bombers through a completely different lens. In       there were     bomb blasts across Pakistan. I spent the year working with children who were training to become suicide bombers and with Taliban recruiters  trying to understand how the Taliban were converting these children into live ammunition and why these children were actively signing up to their cause. I want you to watch a short video from my latest documentary film   Children of the Taliban.  The Taliban now run their own schools. They target poor families and convince the parents to send their children. In return  they provide free food and shelter and sometimes pay the families a monthly stipend. We've obtained a propaganda video made by the Taliban. Young boys are taught justifications for suicide attacks and the execution of spies. I made contact with a child from Swat who studied in a madrassa like this. Hazrat Ali is from a poor farming family in Swat. He joined the Taliban a year ago when he was   . How do the Taliban in your area get people to join them  Hazrat Ali  They first call us to the mosque and preach to us. Then they take us to a madrassa and teach us things from the Koran. Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy  He tells me that children are then given months of military training. HA  They teach us to use machine guns  Kalashnikov  rocket launchers  grenades  bombs. They ask us to use them only against the infidels. Then they teach us to do a suicide attack. SOC  Would you like to carry out a suicide attack  HA  If God gives me strength. SOC  I  in my research  have seen that the Taliban have perfected the way in which they recruit and train children  and I think it's a five step process. Step one is that the Taliban prey on families that are large  that are poor  that live in rural areas. They separate the parents from the children by promising to provide food  clothing  shelter to these children. Then they ship them off  hundreds of miles away to hard line schools that run along the Taliban agenda. Step two  They teach the children the Koran  which is Islam's holiest book  in Arabic  a language these children do not understand and cannot speak. They rely very heavily on teachers  who I have personally seen distort the message to these children as and when it suits their purpose to. These children are explicitly forbidden from reading newspapers  listening to radio  reading any books that the teachers do not prescribe them. If any child is found violating these rules  he is severely reprimanded. Effectively  the Taliban create a complete blackout of any other source of information for these children. Step three  The Taliban want these children to hate the world that they currently live in. So they beat these children    I have seen it  they feed them twice a day dried bread and water  they rarely allow them to play games  they tell them that  for eight hours at a time  all they have to do is read the Koran. The children are virtual prisoners  they cannot leave  they cannot go home. Their parents are so poor  they have no resources to get them back. Step four  The older members of the Taliban  the fighters  start talking to the younger boys about the glories of martyrdom. They talk to them about how when they die  they will be received up with lakes of honey and milk  how there will be    virgins waiting for them in paradise  how there will be unlimited food  and how this glory is going to propel them to become heroes in their neighborhoods. Effectively  this is the brainwashing process that has begun. Step five  I believe the Taliban have one of the most effective means of propaganda. Their videos that they use are intercut with photographs of men and women and children dying in Iraq and Afghanistan and in Pakistan. And the basic message is that the Western powers do not care about civilian deaths  so those people who live in areas and support governments that work with Western powers are fair game. That's why Pakistani civilians  over       of whom have been killed in the last two years alone  are fair game. Now these children are primed to become suicide bombers. They're ready to go out and fight because they've been told that this is effectively their only way to glorify Islam. I want you to watch another excerpt from the film. This boy is called Zenola. He blew himself up  killing six. This boy is called Sadik. He killed   . This boy is called Messoud. He killed   . The Taliban are running suicide schools  preparing a generation of boys for atrocities against civilians. Do you want to carry out a suicide attack  Boy  I would love to. But only if I get permission from my dad. When I look at suicide bombers younger than me  or my age  I get so inspired by their terrific attacks. SOC  What blessing would you get from carrying out a suicide attack  Boy  On the day of judgment  God will ask me   Why did you do that   I will answer   My Lord  Only to make you happy  I have laid down my life fighting the infidels.  Then God will look at my intention. If my intention was to eradicate evil for Islam  then I will be rewarded with paradise. Singer    On the day of judgment     My God will call me     My body will be put back together     And God will ask me why I did this   SOC  I leave you all with this thought  If you grew up in these circumstances  faced with these choices  would you choose to live in this world or in the glorious afterlife  As one Taliban recruiter told me   There will always be sacrificial lambs in this war.  Thank you. Do you worry about what is going to kill you  Heart disease  cancer  a car accident  Most of us worry about things we can't control  like war  terrorism  the tragic earthquake that just occurred in Haiti. But what really threatens humanity  A few years ago  Professor Vaclav Smil tried to calculate the probability of sudden disasters large enough to change history. He called these   massively fatal discontinuities   meaning that they could kill up to     million people in the next    years. He looked at the odds of another world war  of a massive volcanic eruption  even of an asteroid hitting the Earth. But he placed the likelihood of one such event above all others at close to     percent  and that is a severe flu pandemic. Now  you might think of flu as just a really bad cold  but it can be a death sentence. Every year         people in the United States die of seasonal flu. In the developing world  the data is much sketchier but the death toll is almost certainly higher. You know  the problem is if this virus occasionally mutates so dramatically  it essentially is a new virus and then we get a pandemic. In       a new virus appeared that killed some    to     million people. It spread like wildfire and some died within hours of developing symptoms. Are we safer today  Well  we seem to have dodged the deadly pandemic this year that most of us feared  but this threat could reappear at any time. The good news is that we're at a moment in time when science  technology  globalization is converging to create an unprecedented possibility  the possibility to make history by preventing infectious diseases that still account for one fifth of all deaths and countless misery on Earth. We can do this. We're already preventing millions of deaths with existing vaccines  and if we get these to more people  we can certainly save more lives. But with new or better vaccines for malaria  TB  HIV  pneumonia  diarrhea  flu  we could end suffering that has been on the Earth since the beginning of time. So  I'm here to trumpet vaccines for you. But first  I have to explain why they're important because vaccines  the power of them  is really like a whisper. When they work  they can make history  but after a while you can barely hear them. Now  some of us are old enough to have a small  circular scar on our arms from an inoculation we received as children. But when was the last time you worried about smallpox  a disease that killed half a billion people last century and no longer is with us  Or polio  How many of you remember the iron lung  We don't see scenes like this anymore because of vaccines. Now  it's interesting because there are    odd diseases that can be treated with vaccines now  but we're still threatened by things like HIV and flu. Why is that  Well  here's the dirty little secret. Until recently  we haven't had to know exactly how a vaccine worked. We knew they worked through old fashioned trial and error. You took a pathogen  you modified it  you injected it into a person or an animal and you saw what happened. This worked well for most pathogens  somewhat well for crafty bugs like flu  but not at all for HIV  for which humans have no natural immunity. So let's explore how vaccines work. They basically create a cache of weapons for your immune system which you can deploy when needed. Now  when you get a viral infection  what normally happens is it takes days or weeks for your body to fight back at full strength  and that might be too late. When you're pre immunized  what happens is you have forces in your body pre trained to recognize and defeat specific foes. So that's really how vaccines work. Now  let's take a look at a video that we're debuting at TED  for the first time  on how an effective HIV vaccine might work. Narrator  A vaccine trains the body in advance how to recognize and neutralize a specific invader. After HIV penetrates the body's mucosal barriers  it infects immune cells to replicate. The invader draws the attention of the immune system's front line troops. Dendritic cells  or macrophages  capture the virus and display pieces of it. Memory cells generated by the HIV vaccine are activated when they learn HIV is present from the front line troops. These memory cells immediately deploy the exact weapons needed. Memory B cells turn into plasma cells  which produce wave after wave of the specific antibodies that latch onto HIV to prevent it from infecting cells  while squadrons of killer T cells seek out and destroy cells that are already HIV infected. The virus is defeated. Without a vaccine  these responses would have taken more than a week. By that time  the battle against HIV would already have been lost. Seth Berkley  Really cool video  isn't it  The antibodies you just saw in this video  in action  are the ones that make most vaccines work. So the real question then is  How do we ensure that your body makes the exact ones that we need to protect against flu and HIV  The principal challenge for both of these viruses is that they're always changing. So let's take a look at the flu virus. In this rendering of the flu virus  these different colored spikes are what it uses to infect you. And also  what the antibodies use is a handle to essentially grab and neutralize the virus. When these mutate  they change their shape  and the antibodies don't know what they're looking at anymore. So that's why every year you can catch a slightly different strain of flu. It's also why in the spring  we have to make a best guess at which three strains are going to prevail the next year  put those into a single vaccine and rush those into production for the fall. Even worse  the most common influenza    influenza A    also infects animals that live in close proximity to humans  and they can recombine in those particular animals. In addition  wild aquatic birds carry all known strains of influenza. So  you've got this situation  In       we had an H N  virus that jumped from birds into humans in a few isolated cases with an apparent mortality rate of    percent. Now luckily  that particular virus  although very scary at the time  did not transmit from person to person very easily. This year's H N  threat was actually a human  avian  swine mixture that arose in Mexico. It was easily transmitted  but  luckily  was pretty mild. And so  in a sense  our luck is holding out  but you know  another wild bird could fly over at anytime. Now let's take a look at HIV. As variable as flu is  HIV makes flu look like the Rock of Gibraltar. The virus that causes AIDS is the trickiest pathogen scientists have ever confronted. It mutates furiously  it has decoys to evade the immune system  it attacks the very cells that are trying to fight it and it quickly hides itself in your genome. Here's a slide looking at the genetic variation of flu and comparing that to HIV  a much wilder target. In the video a moment ago  you saw fleets of new viruses launching from infected cells. Now realize that in a recently infected person  there are millions of these ships  each one is just slightly different. Finding a weapon that recognizes and sinks all of them makes the job that much harder. Now  in the    years since HIV was identified as the cause of AIDS  we've developed more drugs to treat HIV than all other viruses put together. These drugs aren't cures  but they represent a huge triumph of science because they take away the automatic death sentence from a diagnosis of HIV  at least for those who can access them. The vaccine effort though is really quite different. Large companies moved away from it because they thought the science was so difficult and vaccines were seen as poor business. Many thought that it was just impossible to make an AIDS vaccine  but today  evidence tells us otherwise. In September  we had surprising but exciting findings from a clinical trial that took place in Thailand. For the first time  we saw an AIDS vaccine work in humans    albeit  quite modestly    and that particular vaccine was made almost a decade ago. Newer concepts and early testing now show even greater promise in the best of our animal models. But in the past few months  researchers have also isolated several new broadly neutralizing antibodies from the blood of an HIV infected individual. Now  what does this mean  We saw earlier that HIV is highly variable  that a broad neutralizing antibody latches on and disables multiple variations of the virus. If you take these and you put them in the best of our monkey models  they provide full protection from infection. In addition  these researchers found a new site on HIV where the antibodies can grab onto  and what's so special about this spot is that it changes very little as the virus mutates. It's like  as many times as the virus changes its clothes  it's still wearing the same socks  and now our job is to make sure we get the body to really hate those socks. So what we've got is a situation. The Thai results tell us we can make an AIDS vaccine  and the antibody findings tell us how we might do that. This strategy  working backwards from an antibody to create a vaccine candidate  has never been done before in vaccine research. It's called retro vaccinology  and its implications extend way beyond that of just HIV. So think of it this way. We've got these new antibodies we've identified  and we know that they latch onto many  many variations of the virus. We know that they have to latch onto a specific part  so if we can figure out the precise structure of that part  present that through a vaccine  what we hope is we can prompt your immune system to make these matching antibodies. And that would create a universal HIV vaccine. Now  it sounds easier than it is because the structure actually looks more like this blue antibody diagram attached to its yellow binding site  and as you can imagine  these three dimensional structures are much harder to work on. And if you guys have ideas to help us solve this  we'd love to hear about it. But  you know  the research that has occurred from HIV now has really helped with innovation with other diseases. So for instance  a biotechnology company has now found broadly neutralizing antibodies to influenza  as well as a new antibody target on the flu virus. They're currently making a cocktail    an antibody cocktail    that can be used to treat severe  overwhelming cases of flu. In the longer term  what they can do is use these tools of retro vaccinology to make a preventive flu vaccine. Now  retro vaccinology is just one technique within the ambit of so called rational vaccine design. Let me give you another example. We talked about before the H and N spikes on the surface of the flu virus. Notice these other  smaller protuberances. These are largely hidden from the immune system. Now it turns out that these spots also don't change much when the virus mutates. If you can cripple these with specific antibodies  you could cripple all versions of the flu. So far  animal tests indicate that such a vaccine could prevent severe disease  although you might get a mild case. So if this works in humans  what we're talking about is a universal flu vaccine  one that doesn't need to change every year and would remove the threat of death. We really could think of flu  then  as just a bad cold. Of course  the best vaccine imaginable is only valuable to the extent we get it to everyone who needs it. So to do that  we have to combine smart vaccine design with smart production methods and  of course  smart delivery methods. So I want you to think back a few months ago. In June  the World Health Organization declared the first global flu pandemic in    years. The U.S. government promised     million doses of vaccine by October   th for the flu peak. Vaccines were promised to developing countries. Hundreds of millions of dollars were spent and flowed to accelerating vaccine manufacturing. So what happened  Well  we first figured out how to make flu vaccines  how to produce them  in the early     s. It was a slow  cumbersome process that depended on chicken eggs  millions of living chicken eggs. Viruses only grow in living things  and so it turned out that  for flu  chicken eggs worked really well. For most strains  you could get one to two doses of vaccine per egg. Luckily for us  we live in an era of breathtaking biomedical advances. So today  we get our flu vaccines from ... chicken eggs  hundreds of millions of chicken eggs. Almost nothing has changed. The system is reliable but the problem is you never know how well a strain is going to grow. This year's swine flu strain grew very poorly in early production  basically .  doses per egg. So  here's an alarming thought. What if that wild bird flies by again  You could see an avian strain that would infect the poultry flocks  and then we would have no eggs for our vaccines. So  Dan  Barber   if you want billions of chicken pellets for your fish farm  I know where to get them. So right now  the world can produce about     million doses of flu vaccine for the three strains  and we can up that to about  .  billion doses if we want to target a single variant like swine flu. But this assumes that our factories are humming because  in       the U.S. supply was cut in half by contamination at one single plant. And the process still takes more than half a year. So are we better prepared than we were in       Well  with the new technologies emerging now  I hope we can say definitively   Yes.  Imagine we could produce enough flu vaccine for everyone in the entire world for less than half of what we're currently spending now in the United States. With a range of new technologies  we could. Here's an example  A company I'm engaged with has found a specific piece of the H spike of flu that sparks the immune system. If you lop this off and attach it to the tail of a different bacterium  which creates a vigorous immune response  they've created a very powerful flu fighter. This vaccine is so small it can be grown in a common bacteria  E. coli. Now  as you know  bacteria reproduce quickly    it's like making yogurt    and so we could produce enough swine origin flu for the entire world in a few factories  in a few weeks  with no eggs  for a fraction of the cost of current methods. So here's a comparison of several of these new vaccine technologies. And  aside from the radically increased production and huge cost savings    for example  the E. coli method I just talked about    look at the time saved  this would be lives saved. The developing world  mostly left out of the current response  sees the potential of these alternate technologies and they're leapfrogging the West. India  Mexico and others are already making experimental flu vaccines  and they may be the first place we see these vaccines in use. Because these technologies are so efficient and relatively cheap  billions of people can have access to lifesaving vaccines if we can figure out how to deliver them. Now think of where this leads us. New infectious diseases appear or reappear every few years. Some day  perhaps soon  we'll have a virus that is going to threaten all of us. Will we be quick enough to react before millions die  Luckily  this year's flu was relatively mild. I say   luckily  in part because virtually no one in the developing world was vaccinated. So if we have the political and financial foresight to sustain our investments  we will master these and new tools of vaccinology  and with these tools we can produce enough vaccine for everyone at low cost and ensure healthy productive lives. No longer must flu have to kill half a million people a year. No longer does AIDS need to kill two million a year. No longer do the poor and vulnerable need to be threatened by infectious diseases  or indeed  anybody. Instead of having Vaclav Smil's  massively fatal discontinuity  of life  we can ensure the continuity of life. What the world needs now are these new vaccines  and we can make it happen. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Thank you. Thank you. So  the science is changing. In your mind  Seth    I mean  you must dream about this    what is the kind of time scale on  let's start with HIV  for a game changing vaccine that's actually out there and usable  SB  The game change can come at any time  because the problem we have now is we've shown we can get a vaccine to work in humans  we just need a better one. And with these types of antibodies  we know humans can make them. So  if we can figure out how to do that  then we have the vaccine  and what's interesting is there already is some evidence that we're beginning to crack that problem. So  the challenge is full speed ahead. CA  In your gut  do you think it's probably going to be at least another five years  SB  You know  everybody says it's    years  but it's been    years every    years. So I hate to put a timeline on scientific innovation  but the investments that have occurred are now paying dividends. CA  And that's the same with universal flu vaccine  the same kind of thing  SB  I think flu is different. I think what happened with flu is we've got a bunch    I just showed some of this    a bunch of really cool and useful technologies that are ready to go now. They look good. The problem has been that  what we did is we invested in traditional technologies because that's what we were comfortable with. You also can use adjuvants  which are chemicals you mix. That's what Europe is doing  so we could have diluted out our supply of flu and made more available  but  going back to what Michael Specter said  the anti vaccine crowd didn't really want that to happen. CA  And malaria's even further behind  SB  No  malaria  there is a candidate that actually showed efficacy in an earlier trial and is currently in phase three trials now. It probably isn't the perfect vaccine  but it's moving along. CA  Seth  most of us do work where every month  we produce something  we get that kind of gratification. You've been slaving away at this for more than a decade  and I salute you and your colleagues for what you do. The world needs people like you. Thank you. SB  Thank you. I want to talk about what we learn from conservatives. And I'm at a stage in life where I'm yearning for my old days  so I want to confess to you that when I was a kid  indeed  I was a conservative. I was a Young Republican  a Teenage Republican  a leader in the Teenage Republicans. Indeed  I was the youngest member of any delegation in the      convention that elected Ronald Reagan to be the Republican nominee for president. Now  I know what you're thinking. You're thinking   That's not what the Internets say.  You're thinking   Wikipedia doesn't say this fact.  And indeed  this is just one of the examples of the junk that flows across the tubes in these Internets here. Wikipedia reports that this guy  this former congressman from Erie  Pennsylvania was  at the age of     one of the youngest people at the Republican National Convention  but it's just not true. Indeed  it drives me so nuts  let me just change this little fact here. All right. Okay  so ... perfect. Perfect. Okay  speaker Lawrence Lessig  right. Okay. Finally  truth will be brought here. Okay  see  It's done. It's almost done. Here we go.  ... Youngest Republican   okay  we're finished. That's it. Please save this. Great  here we go. And ... Wikipedia is fixed  finally. Okay  but no  this is really besides the point. But the thing I want you to think about when we think about conservatives    not so much this issue of the      convention    the thing to think about is this  They go to church. Now  you know  I mean  a lot of people go to church. I'm not talking about that only conservatives go to church. And I'm not talking about the God thing. I don't want to get into that  you know  that's not my point. They go to church  by which I mean  they do lots of things for free for each other. They hold potluck dinners. Indeed  they sell books about potluck dinners. They serve food to poor people. They share  they give  they give away for free. And it's the very same people leading Wall Street firms who  on Sundays  show up and share. And not only food  right. These very same people are strong believers  in lots of contexts  in the limits on the markets. They are in many important places against markets. Indeed  they  like all of us  celebrate this kind of relationship. But they're very keen that we don't let money drop into that relationship  else it turns into something like this. They want to regulate us  those conservatives  to stop us from allowing the market to spread in those places. Because they understand  There are places for the market and places where the market should not exist  where we should be free to enjoy the fellowship of others. They recognize  Both of these things have to live together. And the second great thing about conservatives  they get ecology. Right  it was the first great Republican president of the   th century who taught us about environmental thinking    Teddy Roosevelt. They first taught us about ecology in the context of natural resources. And then they began to teach us in the context of innovation  economics. They understand  in that context   free.  They understand  free  is an important essential part of the cultural ecology as well. That's the thing I want you to think about them. Now  I know you don't believe me  really  here. So here's exhibit number one. I want to share with you my latest hero  Julian Sanchez  a libertarian who works at the  for many people   evil  Cato Institute. Okay  so Julian made this video. He's a terrible producer of videos  but it's great content  so I'm going to give you a little bit of it. So here he is beginning. Julian Sanchez  I'm going to make an observation about the way remix culture seems to be evolving ... Larry Lessig  So what he does is he begins to tell us about these three videos. This is this fantastic Brat Pack remix set to Lisztomania. Which  of course  spread virally. Hugely successful. And then some people from Brooklyn saw it. They decided they wanted to do the same. And then  of course  people from San Fransisco saw it. And San Franciscans thought they had to do the same as well. And so they're beautiful  but this libertarian has some important lessons he wants us to learn from this. Here's lesson number one. JS  There's obviously also something really deeply great about this. They are acting in the sense that they're emulating the original mashup. And the guy who shot it obviously has a strong eye and some experience with video editing. But this is also basically just a group of friends having an authentic social moment and screwing around together. It should feel familiar and kind of resonate for anyone who's had a sing a long or a dance party with a group of good friends. LL  Or ... JS  So that's importantly different from the earlier videos we looked at because here  remix isn't just about an individual doing something alone in his basement  it becomes an act of social creativity. And it's not just that it yields a different kind of product at the end  it's that potentially it changes the way that we relate to each other. All of our normal social interactions become a kind of invitation to this sort of collective expression. It's our real social lives themselves that are transmuted into art. LL  And so then  what this libertarian draws from these two points ... JS  One remix is about individuals using our shared culture as a kind of language to communicate something to an audience. Stage two  social remix  is really about using it to mediate people's relationships to each other. First  within each video  the Brat Pack characters are used as a kind of template for performing the social reality of each group. But there's also a dialogue between the videos  where  once the basic structure is established  it becomes a kind of platform for articulating the similarities and differences between the groups' social and physical worlds. LL  And then  here's for me  the critical key to what Julian has to say ... JS  Copyright policy isn't just about how to incentivize the production of a certain kind of artistic commodity  it's about what level of control we're going to permit to be exercised over our social realities    social realities that are now inevitably permeated by pop culture. I think it's important that we keep these two different kinds of public goods in mind. If we're only focused on how to maximize the supply of one  I think we risk suppressing this different and richer and  in some ways  maybe even more important one. LL  Right. Bingo. Point. Freedom needs this opportunity to both have the commercial success of the great commercial works and the opportunity to build this different kind of culture. And for that to happen  you need ideas like fair use to be central and protected  to enable this kind of innovation  as this libertarian tells us  between these two creative cultures  a commercial and a sharing culture. The point is they  he  here  gets that culture. Now  my concern is  we Dems  too often  not so much. All right  take for example this great company. In the good old days when this Republican ran that company  their greatest work was work that built on the past  right. All of the great Disney works were works that took works that were in the public domain and remixed them  or waited until they entered the public domain to remix them  to celebrate this add on remix creativity. Indeed  Mickey Mouse himself  of course  as  Steamboat Willie   is a remix of the then  very dominant  very popular  Steamboat Bill  by Buster Keaton. This man was a remixer extraordinaire. He is the celebration and ideal of exactly this kind of creativity. But then the company passes through this dark stage to this Democrat. Wildly different. This is the mastermind behind the eventual passage of what we call the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act  extending the term of existing copyrights by    years  so that no one could do to Disney what Disney did to the Brothers Grimm. Now  when we tried to challenge this  going to the Supreme Court  getting the Supreme Court  the bunch of conservatives there    if we could get them to wake up to this    to strike it down  we had the assistance of Nobel Prize winners including this right wing Nobel Prize winner  Milton Friedman  who said he would join our brief only if the word  no brainer  was in the brief somewhere. But apparently  no brains existed in this place when Democrats passed and signed this bill into law. Now  tiny little quibble of a footnote  Sonny Bono  you might say  was a Republican  but I don't buy it. This guy is no Republican. Okay  for a second example  think about this cultural hero  icon on the Left  creator of this character. Look at the site that he built   Star Wars  MashUps  inviting people to come and use their creative energy to produce a new generation of attention towards this extraordinarily important cultural icon. Read the license. The license for these remixers assigns all of the rights to the remix back to Lucas. The mashup is owned by Lucas. Indeed  anything you add to the mashup  music you might add  Lucas has a worldwide perpetual right to exploit that for free. There is no creator here to be recognized. The creator doesn't have any rights. The creator is a sharecropper in this story. And we should remember who employed the sharecroppers  the Democrats  right  So the point is the Republicans here recognize that there's a certain need of ownership  a respect for ownership  the respect we should give the creator  the remixer  the owner  the property owner  the copyright owner of this extraordinarily powerful stuff  and not a generation of sharecroppers. Now  I think there are lessons we should learn here  lessons about openness. Our lives are sharing activities  at least in part. Even for the head of Goldman Sachs  at least in part. And for that sharing activity to happen  we have to have well protected spaces of fair use. That's number one. Number two  This ecology of sharing needs freedom within which to create. Freedom  which means without permission from anyone  the ability to create. And number three  We need to respect the creator  the creator of these remixes through rights that are directly tied to them. Now  this explains the right wing nonprofit Creative Commons. Actually  it's not a right wing nonprofit  but of course    let me just tie it here    the Creative Commons  which is offering authors this simple way to mark their content with the freedoms they intended to carry. So that we go from a  all rights reserved  world to a  some rights reserved  world so that people can know the freedoms they have attached to the content  building and creating on the basis of this creative copyrighted work. These tools that we built enable this sharing in parts through licenses that make it clear and a freedom to create without requiring permission first because the permission has already been granted and a respect for the creator because it builds upon a copyright the creator has licensed freely. And it explains the vast right wing conspiracy that's obviously developed around these licenses  as now more than     million digital objects are out there  licensed freely in this way. Now that picture of an ecology of creativity  the picture of an ecology of balanced creativity  is that the ecology of creativity we have right now  Well  as you all know  not many of us believe we do. I tripped on the reality of this ecology of creativity just last week. I created a video which was based on a Wireside Chat that I'd given  and I uploaded it to YouTube. I then got this email from YouTube weirdly notifying me that there was content in that owned by the mysterious WMG that matched their content ID. So I didn't think much about it. And then on Twitter  somebody said to me   Your talk on YouTube was DMCA'd. Was that your purpose   imagining that I had this deep conspiracy to reveal the obvious flaws in the DMCA. I answered   No.  I didn't even think about it. But then I went to the site and all of the audio in my site had been silenced. My whole    minute video had been silenced because there were snippets in that video  a video about fair use  that included Warner Music Group music. Now  interestingly  they still sold ads for that music  if you played the silent video. You could still buy the music  but you couldn't hear anything because it had been silenced. So I did what the current regime says I must do to be free to use YouTube to talk about fair use. I went to this site  and I had to answer these questions. And then in an extraordinarily Bart Simpson like  juvenile way you've actually got to type out these words and get them right to reassert your freedom to speak. And I felt like I was in third grade again.  I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair. I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair.  This is absurd. It is outrageous. It is an extraordinary perversion of the system of freedom we should be encouraging. And the question I ask you is  Who's fighting it  Well  interestingly  in the last presidential election  who was the number one  active opponent of this system of regulation in online speech  John McCain. Letter after letter attacking YouTube's refusal to be more respectful of fair use with their extraordinary notice and take down system  that led his campaign so many times to be thrown off the Internet. Now  that was the story of me then  my good old days of right wing lunacy. Let me come back to now  now when I'm a little leftist    I'm certainly left handed  so at least a lefty    And I wonder  can we on the Left expect to build this ecology of freedom  now  in a world where we know the extraordinarily powerful influences against it  where even icons of the Left like this entertain and push bills that would effectively ban the requirement of open access for government funded research  The president  who has supported a process that secretly negotiates agreements  which effectively lock us into the insane system of DMCA that we have adopted and likely lock us down a path of three strikes  you're out that  of course  the rest of the world are increasingly adopting. Not a single example of reform has been produced yet. And we're not going to see this change in this system anytime soon. So here's the lessons of openness that I think we need to learn. Openness is a commitment to a certain set of values. We need to speak of those values. The value of freedom. It's a value of community. It's a value of the limits in regulation. It's a value respecting the creator. Now  if we can learn those values from at least some influences on the Right  if we can take them and incorporate them  maybe we could do a little trade. We learn those values on the Left  and maybe they'll do health care or global warming legislation or something in the Right. Anyway  please join me in teaching these values. Thank you very much. We're        years after the advent of the Macintosh  which was an astoundingly seminal event in the history of human machine interface and in computation in general. It fundamentally changed the way that people thought about computation  thought about computers  how they used them and who and how many people were able to use them. It was such a radical change  in fact  that the early Macintosh development team in '    '    '   had to write an entirely new operating system from the ground up. Now  this is an interesting little message  and it's a lesson that has since  I think  been forgotten or lost or something  and that is  namely  that the OS is the interface. The interface is the OS. It's like the land and the king  i.e. Arthur  they're inseparable  they are one. And to write a new operating system was not a capricious matter. It wasn't just a matter of tuning up some graphics routines. There were no graphics routines. There were no mouse drivers. So it was a necessity. But in the quarter century since then  we've seen all of the fundamental supporting technologies go berserk. So memory capacity and disk capacity have been multiplied by something between        and a million. Same thing for processor speeds. Networks  we didn't have networks at all at the time of the Macintosh's introduction  and that has become the single most salient aspect of how we live with computers. And  of course  graphics  Today    dollars and    cents at Best Buy buys you more graphics power than you could have gotten for a million bucks from SGI only a decade ago. So we've got that incredible ramp up. Then  on the side  we've got the Web and  increasingly  the cloud  which is fantastic  but also    in the regard in which an interface is fundamental    kind of a distraction. So we've forgotten to invent new interfaces. Certainly we've seen in recent years a lot of change in that regard  and people are starting to wake up about that. So what happens next  Where do we go from there  The problem  as we see it  has to do with a single  simple word   space   or a single  simple phrase   real world geometry.  Computers and the programming languages that we talk to them in  that we teach them in  are hideously insensate when it comes to space. They don't understand real world space. It's a funny thing because the rest of us occupy it quite frequently and quite well. They also don't understand time  but that's a matter for a separate talk. So what happens if you start to explain space to them  One thing you might get is something like the Luminous Room. The Luminous Room is a system in which it's considered that input and output spaces are co located. That's a strangely simple  and yet unexplored idea  right  When you use a mouse  your hand is down here on the mouse pad. It's not even on the same plane as what you're talking about  The pixels are up on the display. So here was a room in which all the walls  floors  ceilings  pets  potted plants  whatever was in there  were capable  not only of display but of sensing as well. And that means input and output are in the same space enabling stuff like this. That's a digital storage in a physical container. The contract is the same as with real word objects in real world containers. Has to come back out  whatever you put in. This little design experiment that was a small office here knew a few other tricks as well. If you presented it with a chess board  it tried to figure out what you might mean by that. And if there was nothing for them to do  the chess pieces eventually got bored and hopped away. The academics who were overseeing this work thought that that was too frivolous  so we built deadly serious applications like this optics prototyping workbench in which a toothpaste cap on a cardboard box becomes a laser. The beam splitters and lenses are represented by physical objects  and the system projects down the laser beam path. So you've got an interface that has no interface. You operate the world as you operate the real world  which is to say  with your hands. Similarly  a digital wind tunnel with digital wind flowing from right to left    not that remarkable in a sense  we didn't invent the mathematics. But if you displayed that on a CRT or flat panel display  it would be meaningless to hold up an arbitrary object  a real world object in that. Here  the real world merges with the simulation. And finally  to pull out all the stops  this is a system called Urp  for urban planners  in which we give architects and urban planners back the models that we confiscated when we insisted that they use CAD systems. And we make the machine meet them half way. It projects down digital shadows  as you see here. And if you introduce tools like this inverse clock  then you can control the sun's position in the sky. That's   a.m. shadows. They get a little shorter at   a.m. There you are  swinging the sun around. Short shadows at noon and so forth. And we built up a series of tools like this. There are inter shadowing studies that children can operate  even though they don't know anything about urban planning  To move a building  you simply reach out your hand and you move the building. A material wand makes the building into a sort of Frank Gehry thing that reflects light in all directions. Are you blinding passers by and motorists on the freeways  A zoning tool connects distant structures  a building and a roadway. Are you going to get sued by the zoning commission  And so forth. Now  if these ideas seem familiar or perhaps even a little dated  that's great  they should seem familiar. This work is    years old. This stuff was undertaken at MIT and the Media Lab under the incredible direction of Professor Hiroshi Ishii  director of the Tangible Media Group. But it was that work that was seen by Alex McDowell  one of the world's legendary production designers. But Alex was preparing a little  sort of obscure  indie  arthouse film called  Minority Report  for Steven Spielberg  and invited us to come out from MIT and design the interfaces that would appear in that film. And the great thing about it was that Alex was so dedicated to the idea of verisimilitude  the idea that the putative      that we were painting in the film be believable  that he allowed us to take on that design work as if it were an R D effort. And the result is sort of gratifyingly perpetual. People still reference those sequences in  Minority Report  when they talk about new UI design. So this led full circle  in a strange way  to build these ideas into what we believe is the necessary future of human machine interface  the Spatial Operating Environment  we call it. So here we have a bunch of stuff  some images. And  using a hand  we can actually exercise six degrees of freedom  six degrees of navigational control. And it's fun to fly through Mr. Beckett's eye. And you can come back out through the scary orangutan. And that's all well and good. Let's do something a little more difficult. Here  we have a whole bunch of disparate images. We can fly around them. So navigation is a fundamental issue. You have to be able to navigate in  D. Much of what we want computers to help us with in the first place is inherently spatial. And the part that isn't spatial can often be spatialized to allow our wetware to make greater sense of it. Now we can distribute this stuff in many different ways. So we can throw it out like that. Let's reset it. We can organize it this way. And  of course  it's not just about navigation  but about manipulation as well. So if we don't like stuff  or we're intensely curious about Ernst Haeckel's scientific falsifications  we can pull them out like that. And then if it's time for analysis  we can pull back a little bit and ask for a different distribution. Let's just come down a bit and fly around. So that's a different way to look at stuff. If you're of a more analytical nature then you might want  actually  to look at this as a color histogram. So now we've got the stuff color sorted  angle maps onto color. And now  if we want to select stuff   D  space  the idea that we're tracking hands in real space becomes really important because we can reach in  not in  D  not in fake  D  but in actual  D. Here are some selection planes. And we'll perform this Boolean operation because we really love yellow and tapirs on green grass. So  from there to the world of real work. Here's a logistics system  a small piece of one that we're currently building. There're a lot of elements. And one thing that's very important is to combine traditional tabular data with three dimensional and geospatial information. So here's a familiar place. And we'll bring this back here for a second. Maybe select a little bit of that. And bring out this graph. And we should  now  be able to fly in here and have a closer look. These are logistics elements that are scattered across the United States. One thing that three dimensional interactions and the general idea of imbuing computation with space affords you is a final destruction of that unfortunate one to one pairing between human beings and computers. That's the old way  that's the old mantra  one machine  one human  one mouse  one screen. Well  that doesn't really cut it anymore. In the real world  we have people who collaborate  we have people who have to work together  and we have many different displays. And we might want to look at these various images. We might want to ask for some help. The author of this new pointing device is sitting over there  so I can pull this from there to there. These are unrelated machines  right  So the computation is space soluble and network soluble. So I'm going to leave that over there because I have a question for Paul. Paul is the designer of this wand  and maybe its easiest for him to come over here and tell me in person what's going on. So let me get some of these out of the way. Let's pull this apart  I'll go ahead and explode it. Kevin  can you help  Let me see if I can help us find the circuit board. Mind you  it's a sort of gratuitous field stripping exercise  but we do it in the lab all the time. All right. So collaborative work  whether it's immediately co located or distant and distinct  is always important. And again  that stuff needs to be undertaken in the context of space. And finally  I'd like to leave you with a glimpse that takes us back to the world of imagery. This is a system called TAMPER  which is a slightly whimsical look at what the future of editing and media manipulation systems might be. We at Oblong believe that media should be accessible in much more fine grained form. So we have a large number of movies stuck inside here. And let's just pick out a few elements. We can zip through them as a possibility. We can grab elements off the front  where upon they reanimate  come to life  and drag them down onto the table here. We'll go over to Jacques Tati here and grab our blue friend and put him down on the table as well. We may need more than one. And we probably need  well  we probably need a cowboy to be quite honest. Yeah  let's take that one. You see  cowboys and French farce people don't go well together  and the system knows that. Let me leave with one final thought  and that is that one of the greatest English language writers of the last three decades suggested that great art is always a gift. And he wasn't talking about whether the novel costs   .    dollars   or whether you have to spring    million bucks to buy the stolen Vermeer  he was talking about the circumstances of its creation and of its existence. And I think that it's time that we asked for the same from technology. Technology is capable of expressing and being imbued with a certain generosity  and we need to demand that  in fact. For some of this kind of technology  ground center is a combination of design  which is crucially important. We can't have advances in technology any longer unless design is integrated from the very start. And  as well  as of efficacy  agency. We're  as human beings  the creatures that create  and we should make sure that our machines aid us in that task and are built in that same image. So I will leave you with that. Thank you. Chris Anderson  So to ask the obvious question    actually this is from Bill Gates    when   John Underkoffler  When   CA  When real  When for us  not just in a lab and on a stage  Can it be for every man  or is this just for corporations and movie producers  JU  No  it has to be for every human being. That's our goal entirely. We won't have succeeded unless we take that next big step. I mean it's been    years. Can there really be only one interface  There can't. CA  But does that mean that  at your desk or in your home  you need projectors  cameras  You know  how can it work  JU  No  this stuff will be built into the bezel of every display. It'll be built into architecture. The gloves go away in a matter of months or years. So this is the inevitability about it. CA  So  in your mind  five years time  someone can buy this as part of a standard computer interface  JU  I think in five years time when you buy a computer  you'll get this. CA  Well that's cool. The world has a habit of surprising us as to how these things are actually used. What do you think  what in your mind is the first killer app for this  JU  That's a good question  and we ask ourselves that every day. At the moment  our early adopter customers    and these systems are deployed out in the real world    do all the big data intensive  data heavy problems with it. So  whether it's logistics and supply chain management or natural gas and resource extraction  financial services  pharmaceuticals  bioinformatics  those are the topics right now  but that's not a killer app. And I understand what you're asking. CA  C'mon  c'mon. Martial arts  games. C'mon. John  thank you for making science fiction real. JU  It's been a great pleasure. Thank you to you all. I would like to share with you this morning some stories about the ocean through my work as a still photographer for National Geographic magazine. I guess I became an underwater photographer and a photojournalist because I fell in love with the sea as a child. And I wanted to tell stories about all the amazing things I was seeing underwater  incredible wildlife and interesting behaviors. And after even    years of doing this  after    years of exploring the ocean  I never cease to be amazed at the extraordinary encounters that I have while I'm at sea. But more and more frequently these days I'm seeing terrible things underwater as well  things that I don't think most people realize. And I've been compelled to turn my camera towards these issues to tell a more complete story. I want people to see what's happening underwater  both the horror and the magic. The first story that I did for National Geographic  where I recognized the ability to include environmental issues within a natural history coverage  was a story I proposed on harp seals. The story I wanted to do initially was just a small focus to look at the few weeks each year where these animals migrate down from the Canadian arctic to the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada to engage in courtship  mating and to have their pups. And all of this is played out against the backdrop of transient pack ice that moves with wind and tide. And because I'm an underwater photographer  I wanted to do this story from both above and below  to make pictures like this that show one of these little pups making its very first swim in the icy    degree water. But as I got more involved in the story  I realized that there were two big environmental issues I couldn't ignore. The first was that these animals continue to be hunted  killed with hakapiks at about eight     days old. It actually is the largest marine mammal slaughter on the planet  with hundreds of thousands of these seals being killed every year. But as disturbing as that is  I think the bigger problem for harp seals is the loss of sea ice due to global warming. This is an aerial picture that I made that shows the Gulf of St. Lawrence during harp seal season. And even though we see a lot of ice in this picture  there's a lot of water as well  which wasn't there historically. And the ice that is there is quite thin. The problem is that these pups need a stable platform of solid ice in order to nurse from their moms. They only need    days from the moment they're born until they're on their own. But if they don't get    days  they can fall into the ocean and die. This is a photo that I made showing one of these pups that's only about five or seven days old    still has a little bit of the umbilical cord on its belly    that has fallen in because of the thin ice  and the mother is frantically trying to push it up to breathe and to get it back to stable purchase. This problem has continued to grow each year since I was there. I read that last year the pup mortality rate was     percent in parts of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. So  clearly  this species has a lot of problems going forward. This ended up becoming a cover story at National Geographic. And it received quite a bit of attention. And with that  I saw the potential to begin doing other stories about ocean problems. So I proposed a story on the global fish crisis  in part because I had personally witnessed a lot of degradation in the ocean over the last    years  but also because I read a scientific paper that stated that    percent of the big fish in the ocean have disappeared in the last    or    years. These are the tuna  the billfish and the sharks. When I read that  I was blown away by those numbers. I thought this was going to be headline news in every media outlet  but it really wasn't  so I wanted to do a story that was a very different kind of underwater story. I wanted it to be more like war photography  where I was making harder hitting pictures that showed readers what was happening to marine wildlife around the planet. The first component of the story that I thought was essential  however  was to give readers a sense of appreciation for the ocean animals that they were eating. You know  I think people go into a restaurant  and somebody orders a steak  and we all know where steak comes from  and somebody orders a chicken  and we know what a chicken is  but when they're eating bluefin sushi  do they have any sense of the magnificent animal that they're consuming  These are the lions and tigers of the sea. In reality  these animals have no terrestrial counterpart  they're unique in the world. These are animals that can practically swim from the equator to the poles and can crisscross entire oceans in the course of a year. If we weren't so efficient at catching them  because they grow their entire life  would have    year old bluefin out there that weigh a ton. But the truth is we're way too efficient at catching them  and their stocks have collapsed worldwide. This is the daily auction at the Tsukiji Fish Market that I photographed a couple years ago. And every single day these tuna  bluefin like this  are stacked up like cordwood  just warehouse after warehouse. As I wandered around and made these pictures  it sort of occurred to me that the ocean's not a grocery store  you know. We can't keep taking without expecting serious consequences as a result. I also  with the story  wanted to show readers how fish are caught  some of the methods that are used to catch fish  like a bottom trawler  which is one of the most common methods in the world. This was a small net that was being used in Mexico to catch shrimp  but the way it works is essentially the same everywhere in the world. You have a large net in the middle with two steel doors on either end. And as this assembly is towed through the water  the doors meet resistance with the ocean  and it opens the mouth of the net  and they place floats at the top and a lead line on the bottom. And this just drags over the bottom  in this case to catch shrimp. But as you can imagine  it's catching everything else in its path as well. And it's destroying that precious benthic community on the bottom  things like sponges and corals  that critical habitat for other animals. This photograph I made of the fisherman holding the shrimp that he caught after towing his nets for one hour. So he had a handful of shrimp  maybe seven or eight shrimp  and all those other animals on the deck of the boat are bycatch. These are animals that died in the process  but have no commercial value. So this is the true cost of a shrimp dinner  maybe seven or eight shrimp and    pounds of other animals that had to die in the process. And to make that point even more visual  I swam under the shrimp boat and made this picture of the guy shoveling this bycatch into the sea as trash and photographed this cascade of death  you know  animals like guitarfish  bat rays  flounder  pufferfish  that only an hour before  were on the bottom of the ocean  alive  but now being thrown back as trash. I also wanted to focus on the shark fishing industry because  currently on planet Earth  we're killing over     million sharks every single year. But before I went out to photograph this component  I sort of wrestled with the notion of how do you make a picture of a dead shark that will resonate with readers You know  I think there's still a lot of people out there who think the only good shark is a dead shark. But this one morning I jumped in and found this thresher that had just recently died in the gill net. And with its huge pectoral fins and eyes still very visible  it struck me as sort of a crucifixion  if you will. This ended up being the lead picture in the global fishery story in National Geographic. And I hope that it helped readers to take notice of this problem of     million sharks. And because I love sharks    I'm somewhat obsessed with sharks    I wanted to do another  more celebratory  story about sharks  as a way of talking about the need for shark conservation. So I went to the Bahamas because there're very few places in the world where sharks are doing well these days  but the Bahamas seem to be a place where stocks were reasonably healthy  largely due to the fact that the government there had outlawed longlining several years ago. And I wanted to show several species that we hadn't shown much in the magazine and worked in a number of locations. One of the locations was this place called Tiger Beach  in the northern Bahamas where tiger sharks aggregate in shallow water. This is a low altitude photograph that I made showing our dive boat with about a dozen of these big old tiger sharks sort of just swimming around behind. But the one thing I definitely didn't want to do with this coverage was to continue to portray sharks as something like monsters. I didn't want them to be overly threatening or scary. And with this photograph of a beautiful    feet  probably    feet  I guess  female tiger shark  I sort of think I got to that goal  where she was swimming with these little barjacks off her nose  and my strobe created a shadow on her face. And I think it's a gentler picture  a little less threatening  a little more respectful of the species. I also searched on this story for the elusive great hammerhead  an animal that really hadn't been photographed much until maybe about seven or    years ago. It's a very solitary creature. But this is an animal that's considered data deficient by science in both Florida and in the Bahamas. You know  we know almost nothing about them. We don't know where they migrate to or from  where they mate  where they have their pups  and yet  hammerhead populations in the Atlantic have declined about    percent in the last    to    years. You know  we're losing them faster than we can possibly find them. This is the oceanic whitetip shark  an animal that is considered the fourth most dangerous species  if you pay attention to such lists. But it's an animal that's about    percent in decline throughout most of its range. Because this is a pelagic animal and it lives out in the deeper water  and because we weren't working on the bottom  I brought along a shark cage here  and my friend  shark biologist Wes Pratt is inside the cage. You'll see that the photographer  of course  was not inside the cage here  so clearly the biologist is a little smarter than the photographer I guess. And lastly with this story  I also wanted to focus on baby sharks  shark nurseries. And I went to the island of Bimini  in the Bahamas  to work with lemon shark pups. This is a photo of a lemon shark pup  and it shows these animals where they live for the first two to three years of their lives in these protective mangroves. This is a very sort of un shark like photograph. It's not what you typically might think of as a shark picture. But  you know  here we see a shark that's maybe    or    inches long swimming in about a foot of water. But this is crucial habitat and it's where they spend the first two  three years of their lives  until they're big enough to go out on the rest of the reef. After I left Bimini  I actually learned that this habitat was being bulldozed to create a new golf course and resort. And other recent stories have looked at single  flagship species  if you will  that are at risk in the ocean as a way of talking about other threats. One such story I did documented the leatherback sea turtle. This is the largest  widest ranging  deepest diving and oldest of all turtle species. Here we see a female crawling out of the ocean under moonlight on the island of Trinidad. These are animals whose lineage dates back about     million years. And there was a time in their lifespan where they were coming out of the water to nest and saw Tyrannosaurus rex running by. And today  they crawl out and see condominiums. But despite this amazing longevity  they're now considered critically endangered. In the Pacific  where I made this photograph  their stocks have declined about    percent in the last    years. This is a photograph that shows a hatchling about to taste saltwater for the very first time beginning this long and perilous journey. Only one in a thousand leatherback hatchlings will reach maturity. But that's due to natural predators like vultures that pick them off on a beach or predatory fish that are waiting offshore. Nature has learned to compensate with that  and females have multiple clutches of eggs to overcome those odds. But what they can't deal with is anthropogenic stresses  human things  like this picture that shows a leatherback caught at night in a gill net. I actually jumped in and photographed this  and with the fisherman's permission  I cut the turtle out  and it was able to swim free. But  you know  thousands of other leatherbacks each year are not so fortunate  and the species' future is in great danger. Another charismatic megafauna species that I worked with is the story I did on the right whale. And essentially  the story is this with right whales  that about a million years ago  there was one species of right whale on the planet  but as land masses moved around and oceans became isolated  the species sort of separated  and today we have essentially two distinct stocks. We have the Southern right whale that we see here and the North Atlantic right whale that we see here with a mom and calf off the coast of Florida. Now  both species were hunted to the brink of extinction by the early whalers  but the Southern right whales have rebounded a lot better because they're located in places farther away from human activity. The North Atlantic right whale is listed as the most endangered species on the planet today because they are urban whales  they live along the east coast of North America  United States and Canada  and they have to deal with all these urban ills. This photo shows an animal popping its head out at sunset off the coast of Florida. You can see the coal burning plant in the background. They have to deal with things like toxins and pharmaceuticals that are flushed out into the ocean  and maybe even affecting their reproduction. They also get entangled in fishing gear. This is a picture that shows the tail of a right whale. And those white markings are not natural markings. These are entanglement scars.    percent of the population has such scars  but most don't shed the gear  things like lobster traps and crab pots. They hold on to them  and it eventually kills them. And the other problem is they get hit by ships. And this was an animal that was struck by a ship in Nova Scotia  Canada being towed in  where they did a necropsy to confirm the cause of death  which was indeed a ship strike. So all of these ills are stacking up against these animals and keeping their numbers very low. And to draw a contrast with that beleaguered North Atlantic population  I went to a new pristine population of Southern right whales that had only been discovered about    years ago in the sub Antarctic of New Zealand  a place called the Auckland Islands. I went down there in the winter time. And these are animals that had never seen humans before  and I was one of the first people they probably had ever seen. And I got in the water with them  and I was amazed at how curious they were. This photograph shows my assistant standing on the bottom at about    feet and one of these amazingly beautiful     foot     ton whales  like a city bus just swimming up  you know. They were in perfect condition  very fat and healthy  robust  no entanglement scars  the way they're supposed to look. You know  I read that the pilgrims  when they landed at Plymouth Rock in Massachusetts in       wrote that you could walk across Cape Cod Bay on the backs of right whales. And we can't go back and see that today  but maybe we can preserve what we have left. And I wanted to close this program with a story of hope  a story I did on marine reserves as sort of a solution to the problem of overfishing  the global fish crisis story. I settled on working in the country of New Zealand because New Zealand was rather progressive  and is rather progressive in terms of protecting their ocean. And I really wanted this story to be about three things  I wanted it to be about abundance  about diversity and about resilience. And one of the first places I worked was a reserve called Goat Island in Leigh of New Zealand. What the scientists there told me was that when protected this first marine reserve in       they hoped and expected that certain things might happen. For example  they hoped that certain species of fish like the New Zealand snapper would return because they had been fished to the brink of commercial extinction. And they did come back. What they couldn't predict was that other things would happen. For example  these fish predate on sea urchins  and when the fish were all gone  all anyone ever saw underwater was just acres and acres of sea urchins. But when the fish came back and began predating and controlling the urchin population  low and behold  kelp forests emerged in shallow water. And that's because the urchins eat kelp. So when the fish control the urchin population  the ocean was restored to its natural equilibrium. You know  this is probably how the ocean looked here one or     years ago  but nobody was around to tell us. I worked in other parts of New Zealand as well  in beautiful  fragile  protected areas like in Fiordland  where this sea pen colony was found. Little blue cod swimming in for a dash of color. In the northern part of New Zealand  I dove in the blue water  where the water's a little warmer  and photographed animals like this giant sting ray swimming through an underwater canyon. Every part of the ecosystem in this place seems very healthy  from tiny  little animals like a nudibrank crawling over encrusting sponge or a leatherjacket that is a very important animal in this ecosystem because it grazes on the bottom and allows new life to take hold. And I wanted to finish with this photograph  a picture I made on a very stormy day in New Zealand when I just laid on the bottom amidst a school of fish swirling around me. And I was in a place that had only been protected about    years ago. And I talked to divers that had been diving there for many years  and they said that the marine life was better here today than it was in the     s. And that's because it's been protected  that it has come back. So I think the message is clear. The ocean is  indeed  resilient and tolerant to a point  but we must be good custodians. I became an underwater photographer because I fell in love with the sea  and I make pictures of it today because I want to protect it  and I don't think it's too late. Thank you very much. Tom Green  That's a  chan thing. These kids on the Internet  they have this group of kids and they like to say funny words like  barrel roll.  It's a video game move from  Star Fox.   Star Fox       Assistant   Star Fox   .   Tom Green  Yeah. And they've been dogging me for a year. I got to tell you  it's driving me nuts  actually. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and I scream    chan   Christopher Poole  When I was     I found this website called Futaba Channel. And it was a Japanese forum and imageboard. That format of forum  at that time  was not well known outside of Japan. And so what I did is I took it  I translated it into English  and I stuck it up for my friends to use. Now  six and a half years later  over seven million people are using it  contributing over         posts per day. And we've gone from one board to    boards. This is what it looks like. So  what's unique about the site is that it's anonymous  and it has no memory. There's no archive  there are no barriers  there's no registration. These things that we're used to with forums don't exist on  chan. And that's led to this discussion that's completely raw  completely unfiltered. What the site's known for  because it has this environment  is it's fostered the creation of a lot of Internet phenomena  viral videos and whatnot  known as  memes.  Two of the largest memes that have come out of this site some of you might be familiar with are these LOLcats    just silly pictures of cats with text. And this resonates with millions of people  apparently  because there are tens of thousands of these  and there is a whole blogging empire now dedicated to pictures like these. And Rick Astley's kind of rebirth these past two years ... Rickroll was this bait and switch  really simple  classic bait and switch. Somebody says they're linking to something interesting  and you get an '  s pop song. That's all it was. And it got big enough to the point where there was a float last year at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade  and Rick Astley pops out  and rickrolls millions of people on television. There are thousands of memes that come out of the site. There are a handful that have escaped into the mainstream  the ones I've just shown you  but every day  every month  people are producing thousands of these. So does a site like this have rules  We do  they're the codified rules that I've come up with  which are more or less ignored by the community. And so they've come up with their own set of rules  the  Rules of the Internet.  And so there are three that I want to show you specifically. Rule one is you don't talk about  b . Two is you do not talk about  b . And this one's kind of interesting   If it exists  there is porn of it. No exceptions.  And I will spare you that slide. I assure you  it is very true.  b  is the first board we started with  and it is  in many ways  the beating heart of the website. It is where a third of all the traffic is going. And  b  is known for  more than anything  not just the memes they've created  but the exploits. And Chris just touched on one of those a second ago  and that was the Time     poll. So somebody at Time  at the magazine  thought it would be fun to nominate me for this thing they did last year. And so they placed me on it  and the Internet got wind of it. My community decided they wanted me to win it. I didn't instruct them to do it  they just decided that that's what they wanted. And so  you know      percent approval rating ain't so bad. So they broke that poll. And I ended up on top. I ended up at this really fancy party. But that's not what's interesting about this. It's that they weren't putting me at the top of this list  they were actually    it got so sophisticated to the point where they gamed all of the top    places to spell  mARBLECAKE. ALSO  THE GAME.  The amount of time and effort that went into that is absolutely incredible. And  marble cake  is significant because it is the channel that this group called Anonymous organized. Anonymous is this group of people that protested  very famously  Scientology. The story is  Scientology had this embarrassing video of Tom Cruise. It went up online. They got it taken offline and managed to piss off part of the Internet. And so these people  over       people  less than one month later  organized in a hundred cities around the globe and    this is L.A.    protested the Church of Scientology  and they have continued to do so  now  two full years after the fact. They are still protesting. So we've got this activist group that's this grassroots group that's come out of the site. And last  I'm going to show you the example  the story of Dusty the cat. Dusty is the name that we've given to this cat. This young man posted a video of him abusing his cat on YouTube. And  you know  this didn't sit well with people  and so there was this outpouring of support for people to do something about this. So what they did is they    I mean  they put CSI to shame here    the Internet detectives came out. They matched  they found his MySpace. They took the YouTube video and they mashed everything in the video. Within    hours  they had his name  and within    hours  he was arrested. And so  what I think is really intriguing about a community like  chan is just that it's this open place. As I said  it's raw  it's unfiltered. And sites like it are kind of going the way of the dinosaur right now. They're endangered because we're moving towards social networking. We're moving towards persistent identity. We're moving towards  you know  a lack of privacy  really. We're sacrificing a lot of that  and I think in doing so  moving towards those things  we're losing something valuable. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Thank you. Got a couple questions for you. But if I ask them  is the TED website going to go down  CP  You're lucky that this is not being streamed to them live right now. CA  Well  you never know. Some of them    we've got people in    countries out there watching. Don't tell. But seriously  this issue on anonymity is    I mean  you made the case there. But anonymity basically allows people to say anything  all the rules gone. You've had to wrestle with issues like child pornography. And I'm just curious whether you sometimes lie awake in the night worrying that you've opened Pandora's box. CP  Yes and no. I mean  for as much good that kind of comes out of this environment  there is plenty of bad. There are plenty of downsides. But I think that the greater good is being served here by just allowing people    there are very few places  now  where you can go and not have identity  to be completely anonymous and say whatever you'd like. And saying whatever you like  I think  is powerful. Doing whatever you like is now crossing a line. But I think it's important to have these places. When I get emails  people say   Thank you for giving me this place  this outlet  where I can come after work and be myself.  CA  But words  saying things  you know  can be constructive  it can be really damaging. And if you cut the link between what is said and any attribution back to you  I mean  surely there are huge risks with that. CP  There are  certainly. But    CA  Tell me about what    I mean  I think you asked the board what you might say at TED  right  CP  Yeah  I posted a thread on Sunday. And within    hours  it had over        responses. And the thing is  I didn't make it into that presentation because I can't read to you anything that they said  more or less.    percent of it is just  would have been  you know  bleeped out. But there were some good things that came out of that too. Love and peace were mentioned. CA  Love and peace were mentioned  kind of with quote marks around them  right  CP  Cats and dogs were mentioned too. CA  And that content is all off the board now. Right  it's gone  Or is it still up there  CP  I stuck that thread so it lasted a few days. It went up to about        posts  and now it has been taken off. CA  Okay  well. Now  I'm not sure I would have necessarily recommended everyone at TED to go and check it out anyway. Chris  you yourself  I mean  you're a figure of some intrigue. You've got this surprising semi underground influence  but it's not making you a lot of money  yet. What's the commercial picture here  CP  The commercial picture is that there really isn't much of one  I guess. The site has adult content on it. I mean  obviously  it's got some very offensive  obscene content on it  just in terms of language alone. And when you've got that  you've pretty much sacrificed any hope of making lots of money. CA  But you still live at home  right  CP  I actually moved out recently. CA  That's very cool. CP  I got out of Mom's  and I'm back in school right now. CA  But what conversations did you or do you have with your mother about  chan  CP  At first  very kind of pained  awkward conversations. The content is not dinner table conversation in the least. But my parents    I think part of why they kind of are able to appreciate it is because they don't understand it. CA  And they were probably pleased to see you on top of the Time poll. CP  Yeah. They still didn't know what to think of that though. CA  And so  in    years' time  what do you picture yourself doing  CP  That's a good question. As I said  I just went back to school  and I am considering majoring in urban studies and then going on to urban planning  kind of taking whatever I've learned from online communities and trying to adapt that to a physical community. CA  Chris  thank you. Absolutely fascinating. Thank you for coming to TED. We live in difficult and challenging economic times  of course. And one of the first victims of difficult economic times  I think  is public spending of any kind  but certainly in the firing line at the moment is public spending for science  and particularly curiosity led science and exploration. So I want to try and convince you in about    minutes that that's a ridiculous and ludicrous thing to do. But I think to set the scene  I want to show    the next slide is not my attempt to show the worst TED slide in the history of TED  but it is a bit of a mess. But actually  it's not my fault  it's from the Guardian newspaper. And it's actually a beautiful demonstration of how much science costs. Because  if I'm going to make the case for continuing to spend on curiosity driven science and exploration  I should tell you how much it costs. So this is a game called  spot the science budgets.  This is the U.K. government spend. You see there  it's about     billion a year. The science budget is actually    if you look to your left  there's a purple set of blobs and then yellow set of blobs. And it's one of the yellow set of blobs around the big yellow blob. It's about  .  billion pounds per year out of     billion. That funds everything in the U.K. from medical research  space exploration  where I work  at CERN in Geneva  particle physics  engineering  even arts and humanities  funded from the science budget  which is that  .  billion  that little  tiny yellow blob around the orange blob at the top left of the screen. So that's what we're arguing about. That percentage  by the way  is about the same in the U.S. and Germany and France. R D in total in the economy  publicly funded  is about  .  percent of GDP. So that's what we're arguing about. The first thing I want to say  and this is straight from  Wonders of the Solar System   is that our exploration of the solar system and the universe has shown us that it is indescribably beautiful. This is a picture that actually was sent back by the Cassini space probe around Saturn  after we'd finished filming  Wonders of the Solar System.  So it isn't in the series. It's of the moon Enceladus. So that big sweeping  white sphere in the corner is Saturn  which is actually in the background of the picture. And that crescent there is the moon Enceladus  which is about as big as the British Isles. It's about     kilometers in diameter. So  tiny moon. What's fascinating and beautiful ... this an unprocessed picture  by the way  I should say  it's black and white  straight from Saturnian orbit. What's beautiful is  you can probably see on the limb there some faint  sort of  wisps of almost smoke rising up from the limb. This is how we visualize that in  Wonders of the Solar System.  It's a beautiful graphic. What we found out were that those faint wisps are actually fountains of ice rising up from the surface of this tiny moon. That's fascinating and beautiful in itself  but we think that the mechanism for powering those fountains requires there to be lakes of liquid water beneath the surface of this moon. And what's important about that is that  on our planet  on Earth  wherever we find liquid water  we find life. So  to find strong evidence of liquid  pools of liquid  beneath the surface of a moon     million miles away from the Earth is really quite astounding. So what we're saying  essentially  is maybe that's a habitat for life in the solar system. Well  let me just say  that was a graphic. I just want to show this picture. That's one more picture of Enceladus. This is when Cassini flew beneath Enceladus. So it made a very low pass  just a few hundred kilometers above the surface. And so this  again  a real picture of the ice fountains rising up into space  absolutely beautiful. But that's not the prime candidate for life in the solar system. That's probably this place  which is a moon of Jupiter  Europa. And again  we had to fly to the Jovian system to get any sense that this moon  as most moons  was anything other than a dead ball of rock. It's actually an ice moon. So what you're looking at is the surface of the moon Europa  which is a thick sheet of ice  probably a hundred kilometers thick. But by measuring the way that Europa interacts with the magnetic field of Jupiter  and looking at how those cracks in the ice that you can see there on that graphic move around  we've inferred very strongly that there's an ocean of liquid surrounding the entire surface of Europa. So below the ice  there's an ocean of liquid around the whole moon. It could be hundreds of kilometers deep  we think. We think it's saltwater  and that would mean that there's more water on that moon of Jupiter than there is in all the oceans of the Earth combined. So that place  a little moon around Jupiter  is probably the prime candidate for finding life on a moon or a body outside the Earth  that we know of. Tremendous and beautiful discovery. Our exploration of the solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful. It may also have pointed the way to answering one of the most profound questions that you can possibly ask  which is   Are we alone in the universe   Is there any other use to exploration and science  other than just a sense of wonder  Well  there is. This is a very famous picture taken  actually  on my first Christmas Eve  December   th        when I was about eight months old. It was taken by Apollo   as it went around the back of the moon. Earthrise from Apollo  . A famous picture  many people have said that it's the picture that saved       which was a turbulent year    the student riots in Paris  the height of the Vietnam War. The reason many people think that about this picture  and Al Gore has said it many times  actually  on the stage at TED  is that this picture  arguably  was the beginning of the environmental movement. Because  for the first time  we saw our world  not as a solid  immovable  kind of indestructible place  but as a very small  fragile looking world just hanging against the blackness of space. What's also not often said about the space exploration  about the Apollo program  is the economic contribution it made. I mean while you can make arguments that it was wonderful and a tremendous achievement and delivered pictures like this  it cost a lot  didn't it  Well  actually  many studies have been done about the economic effectiveness  the economic impact of Apollo. The biggest one was in      by Chase Econometrics. And it showed that for every    spent on Apollo     came back into the U.S. economy. So the Apollo program paid for itself in inspiration  in engineering  achievement and  I think  in inspiring young scientists and engineers    times over. So exploration can pay for itself. What about scientific discovery  What about driving innovation  Well  this looks like a picture of virtually nothing. What it is  is a picture of the spectrum of hydrogen. See  back in the     s      s  many scientists  many observers  looked at the light given off from atoms. And they saw strange pictures like this. What you're seeing when you put it through a prism is that you heat hydrogen up and it doesn't just glow like a white light  it just emits light at particular colors  a red one  a light blue one  some dark blue ones. Now that led to an understanding of atomic structure because the way that's explained is atoms are a single nucleus with electrons going around them. And the electrons can only be in particular places. And when they jump up to the next place they can be  and fall back down again  they emit light at particular colors. And so the fact that atoms  when you heat them up  only emit light at very specific colors  was one of the key drivers that led to the development of the quantum theory  the theory of the structure of atoms. I just wanted to show this picture because this is remarkable. This is actually a picture of the spectrum of the Sun. And now  this is a picture of atoms in the Sun's atmosphere absorbing light. And again  they only absorb light at particular colors when electrons jump up and fall down  jump up and fall down. But look at the number of black lines in that spectrum. And the element helium was discovered just by staring at the light from the Sun because some of those black lines were found that corresponded to no known element. And that's why helium's called helium. It's called  helios     helios from the Sun. Now  that sounds esoteric  and indeed it was an esoteric pursuit  but the quantum theory quickly led to an understanding of the behaviors of electrons in materials like silicon  for example. The way that silicon behaves  the fact that you can build transistors  is a purely quantum phenomenon. So without that curiosity driven understanding of the structure of atoms  which led to this rather esoteric theory  quantum mechanics  then we wouldn't have transistors  we wouldn't have silicon chips  we wouldn't have pretty much the basis of our modern economy. There's one more  I think  wonderful twist to that tale. In  Wonders of the Solar System   we kept emphasizing the laws of physics are universal. It's one of the most incredible things about the physics and the understanding of nature that you get on Earth  is you can transport it  not only to the planets  but to the most distant stars and galaxies. And one of the astonishing predictions of quantum mechanics  just by looking at the structure of atoms    the same theory that describes transistors    is that there can be no stars in the universe that have reached the end of their life that are bigger than  quite specifically   .  times the mass of the Sun. That's a limit imposed on the mass of stars. You can work it out on a piece of paper in a laboratory  get a telescope  swing it to the sky  and you find that there are no dead stars bigger than  .  times the mass of the Sun. That's quite an incredible prediction. What happens when you have a star that's right on the edge of that mass  Well  this is a picture of it. This is the picture of a galaxy  a common  our garden  galaxy with  what      billion stars like our Sun in it. It's just one of billions of galaxies in the universe. There are a billion stars in the galactic core  which is why it's shining out so brightly. This is about    million light years away  so one of our neighboring galaxies. But that bright star there is actually one of the stars in the galaxy. So that star is also    million light years away. It's part of that galaxy  and it's shining as brightly as the center of the galaxy with a billion suns in it. That's a Type Ia supernova explosion. Now that's an incredible phenomena  because it's a star that sits there. It's called a carbon oxygen dwarf. It sits there about  say   .  times the mass of the Sun. And it has a binary companion that goes around it  so a big star  a big ball of gas. And what it does is it sucks gas off its companion star  until it gets to this limit called the Chandrasekhar limit  and then it explodes. And it explodes  and it shines as brightly as a billion suns for about two weeks  and releases  not only energy  but a huge amount of chemical elements into the universe. In fact  that one is a carbon oxygen dwarf. Now  there was no carbon and oxygen in the universe at the Big Bang. And there was no carbon and oxygen in the universe throughout the first generation of stars. It was made in stars like that  locked away and then returned to the universe in explosions like that in order to recondense into planets  stars  new solar systems and  indeed  people like us. I think that's a remarkable demonstration of the power and beauty and universality of the laws of physics  because we understand that process  because we understand the structure of atoms here on Earth. This is a beautiful quote that I found    we're talking about serendipity there    from Alexander Fleming   When I woke up just after dawn on September           I certainly didn't plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world's first antibiotic.  Now  the explorers of the world of the atom did not intend to invent the transistor. And they certainly didn't intend to describe the mechanics of supernova explosions  which eventually told us where the building blocks of life were synthesized in the universe. So  I think science can be    serendipity is important. It can be beautiful. It can reveal quite astonishing things. It can also  I think  finally reveal the most profound ideas to us about our place in the universe and really the value of our home planet. This is a spectacular picture of our home planet. Now  it doesn't look like our home planet. It looks like Saturn because  of course  it is. It was taken by the Cassini space probe. But it's a famous picture  not because of the beauty and majesty of Saturn's rings  but actually because of a tiny  faint blob just hanging underneath one of the rings. And if I blow it up there  you see it. It looks like a moon  but in fact  it's a picture of Earth. It was a picture of Earth captured in that frame of Saturn. That's our planet from     million miles away. I think the Earth has got a strange property that the farther away you get from it  the more beautiful it seems. But that is not the most distant or most famous picture of our planet. It was taken by this thing  which is called the Voyager spacecraft. And that's a picture of me in front of it for scale. The Voyager is a tiny machine. It's currently    billion miles away from Earth  transmitting with that dish  with the power of    watts  and we're still in contact with it. But it visited Jupiter  Saturn  Uranus and Neptune. And after it visited all four of those planets  Carl Sagan  who's one of my great heroes  had the wonderful idea of turning Voyager around and taking a picture of every planet it had visited. And it took this picture of Earth. Now it's very hard to see the Earth there  it's called the  Pale Blue Dot  picture  but Earth is suspended in that red shaft of light. That's Earth from four billion miles away. And I'd like to read you what Sagan wrote about it  just to finish  because I cannot say words as beautiful as this to describe what he saw in that picture that he had taken. He said   Consider again that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it  everyone you love  everyone you know  everyone you've ever heard of  every human being who ever was lived out their lives. The aggregates of joy and suffering thousands of confident religions  ideologies and economic doctrines  every hunter and forager  every hero and coward  every creator and destroyer of civilization  every king and peasant  every young couple in love  every mother and father  hopeful child  inventor and explorer  every teacher of morals  every corrupt politician  every superstar  every supreme leader  every saint and sinner in the history of our species  lived there  on a mote of dust  suspended in a sunbeam. It's been said that astronomy's a humbling and character building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me  it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot  the only home we've ever known.  Beautiful words about the power of science and exploration. The argument has always been made  and it will always be made  that we know enough about the universe. You could have made it in the     s  you wouldn't have had penicillin. You could have made it in the     s  you wouldn't have the transistor. And it's made today in these difficult economic times. Surely  we know enough. We don't need to discover anything else about our universe. Let me leave the last words to someone who's rapidly becoming a hero of mine  Humphrey Davy  who did his science at the turn of the   th century. He was clearly under assault all the time.  We know enough at the turn of the   th century. Just exploit it  just build things.  He said this  he said   Nothing is more fatal to the progress of the human mind than to presume that our views of science are ultimate  that our triumphs are complete  that there are no mysteries in nature  and that there are no new worlds to conquer.  Thank you. Hi there. I'm going to be talking a little bit about music  machines and life. Or  more specifically  what we learned from the creation of a very large and complicated machine for a music video. Some of you may recognize this image. This is the opening frame of the video that we created. We'll be showing the video at the end  but before we do  I want to talk a little bit about what it is that they wanted. Now  when we first started talking to OK Go    the name of the song is  This Too Shall Pass     we were really excited because they expressed interest in building a machine that they could dance with. And we were very excited about this because  of course  they have a history of dancing with machines. They're responsible for this video   Here It Goes Again.     million plus views on YouTube. Four guys dancing on treadmills  no cuts  just a static camera. A fantastically viral and wonderful video. So we were really excited about working with them. And we sort of started talking about what it is that they wanted. And they explained that they wanted kind of a Rube Goldberg machine. Now  for those of you who don't know  a Rube Goldberg machine is a complicated contraption  an incredibly over engineered piece of machinery that accomplishes a relatively simple task. So we were excited by this idea  and we started talking about exactly what it would look like. And we came up with some parameters  because  you know  building a Rube Goldberg machine has limitations  but it also is pretty wide open. And we wanted to make sure that we did something that would work for a music video. So we came up with a list of requirements  the     commandments   and they were  in order of ascending difficulty  The first is  No magic.  Everything that happened on screen had to be very easily understood by a typical viewer. The rule of thumb was that  if my mother couldn't understand it  then we couldn't use it in the video. They wanted band integration  that is  the machine acting upon the band members  specifically not the other way around. They wanted the machine action to follow the song feeling. So as the song picks up emotion  so should the machine get grander in its process. They wanted us to make use of the space. So we have this        square foot warehouse we were using  divided between two floors. It included an exterior loading dock. We used all of that  including a giant hole in the floor that we actually descended the camera and cameraman through. They wanted it messy  and we were happy to oblige. The machine itself would start the music. So the machine would get started  it would travel some distance  reacting along the way  hit play on an iPod or a tape deck or something that would start playback. And the machine would maintain synchronization throughout. And speaking of synchronization  they wanted it to sync to the rhythm and to hit specific beats along the way. Okay.  Laughter  They wanted it to end precisely on time. Okay  so now the start to finish timing has to be perfect. And they wanted the music to drop out at a certain point in the video and actual live audio from the machine to play part of the song. And as if that wasn't enough  all of these incredibly complicating things  right  they wanted it in one shot. Okay. So  just some statistics about what we went through in the process. The machine itself has    distinct interactions. It took us    takes to get it on film to our satisfaction. Of those    takes  only three actually successfully completed their run. We destroyed two pianos and    televisions in the process. We went to Home Depot well over a hundred times. And we lost one high heeled shoe when one of our engineers  Heather Knight  left her high heeled shoe    after a nice dinner  and returned back to the build    and left it in a pile of stuff. And another engineer thought   Well  that would be a really good thing to use  and ended up using it as a really nice trigger. And it's actually in the machine. So what did we learn from all of this  Well  having completed this  we have the opportunity to step back and reflect on some of the things. And we learned that small stuff stinks. Little balls in wooden tracks are really susceptible to humidity and temperature and a little bit of dust  and they fall out of the tracks  the exact angles makes it hard to get right. And yet  a bowling ball will always follow the same path. It doesn't matter what temperature it is  doesn't matter what's in its way  it will pretty much get where it needs to go. But as much as the small stuff stinks  we needed somewhere to start  so that we would have somewhere to go. And so you have to start with it. You have to focus on it. Small stuff stinks  but  of course  it's essential  right  What else  Planning is incredibly important. You know  we spent a lot of time ideating and even building some of these things. It's been said that   No battle plan survives contact with the enemy.  I think our enemy was physics    and she's a cruel mistress. Often  we had to pull things out as a result because of timing or aesthetics or whatever. And so while planning is important  so is flexibility. These are all things that ended up not making it into the final machine. So also  put reliable stuff last  the stuff that's going to run every time. Again  small to large is relevant here. The little Lego car in the beginning of the video references the big  real car near the end of the video. The big  real car works every time  there's no problem about it. The little one had a tendency to try to run off the track and that's a problem. But you don't want to have to reset the whole machine because the Lego car at the end doesn't work  right. So you put that up front so that  if it fails  at least you know you don't have to reset the whole thing. Life can be messy. There were incredibly difficult moments in the building of this thing. Months were spent in this tiny  cold warehouse. And the wonderful elation that we had when we finally completed it. So it's important to remember that whether it's good or it's bad   This Too Shall Pass.  Thank you very much. And now to introduce their music video  we have OK Go. OK Go  An introduction. Hello TEDxUSC. We are OK Go. What are we doing  Oh  just hanging out with our Grammy. What what  It think we can do better than this. Hello TEDxUSC. We are OK Go. Have you read the  Natural Curiosity Cabinet   I mean   Curiosity     excuse me. Let me start again. We need some more ridiculous things besides  The Cabinet of Natural Curiosities.  Tim's sundial hat. Have you seen the new work they've done to the Waltz Towers  Sorry  start again. Dogs. Hello  TEDxUSC. We are OK Go  and this our new video   This Too Shall Pass.   unclear  Kay  we can still do one better I think  yeah. That one's pretty good. It's getting better.   You know you can't keep letting it get you down     And you can't keep dragging that dead weight around     If there ain't all that much to lug around     Better run like hell when you hit the ground     When the morning comes     When the morning comes     You can't stop these kids from dancing     Why would you want to      Especially when you're already getting yours     Cuz if your mind don't move and your knees don't bend     Well don't go blaming the kids again     When the morning comes     When the morning comes     When the morning comes     When the morning comes     When the morning comes     When the morning comes     Let it go     This too shall pass     Let it go     This too shall pass     You know you can't keep letting it get you down     No  you can't keep letting it get you down     Let it go     This too shall pass     When the morning comes     When the morning comes     When the morning comes     When the morning comes   One thing the world needs  one thing this country desperately needs is a better way of conducting our political debates. We need to rediscover the lost art of democratic argument. If you think about the arguments we have  most of the time it's shouting matches on cable television  ideological food fights on the floor of Congress. I have a suggestion. Look at all the arguments we have these days over health care  over bonuses and bailouts on Wall Street  over the gap between rich and poor  over affirmative action and same sex marriage. Lying just beneath the surface of those arguments  with passions raging on all sides  are big questions of moral philosophy  big questions of justice. But we too rarely articulate and defend and argue about those big moral questions in our politics. So what I would like to do today is have something of a discussion. First  let me take a famous philosopher who wrote about those questions of justice and morality  give you a very short lecture on Aristotle of ancient Athens  Aristotle's theory of justice  and then have a discussion here to see whether Aristotle's ideas actually inform the way we think and argue about questions today. So  are you ready for the lecture  According to Aristotle  justice means giving people what they deserve. That's it  that's the lecture. Now  you may say  well  that's obvious enough. The real questions begin when it comes to arguing about who deserves what and why. Take the example of flutes. Suppose we're distributing flutes. Who should get the best ones  Let's see what people    What would you say  Who should get the best flute  You can just call it out. Michael Sandel  At random. You would do it by lottery. Or by the first person to rush into the hall to get them. Who else  MS  The best flute players.  Audience  The worst flute players.  MS  The worst flute players. How many say the best flute players  Why  Actually  that was Aristotle's answer too. But here's a harder question. Why do you think  those of you who voted this way  that the best flutes should go to the best flute players  Peter  The greatest benefit to all. MS  The greatest benefit to all. We'll hear better music if the best flutes should go to the best flute players. That's Peter   Audience  Peter.  MS  All right. Well  it's a good reason. We'll all be better off if good music is played rather than terrible music. But Peter  Aristotle doesn't agree with you that that's the reason. That's all right. Aristotle had a different reason for saying the best flutes should go to the best flute players. He said  that's what flutes are for    to be played well. He says that to reason about just distribution of a thing  we have to reason about  and sometimes argue about  the purpose of the thing  or the social activity    in this case  musical performance. And the point  the essential nature  of musical performance is to produce excellent music. It'll be a happy byproduct that we'll all benefit. But when we think about justice  Aristotle says  what we really need to think about is the essential nature of the activity in question and the qualities that are worth honoring and admiring and recognizing. One of the reasons that the best flute players should get the best flutes is that musical performance is not only to make the rest of us happy  but to honor and recognize the excellence of the best musicians. Now  flutes may seem ... the distribution of flutes may seem a trivial case. Let's take a contemporary example of the dispute about justice. It had to do with golf. Casey Martin    a few years ago  Casey Martin    did any of you hear about him  He was a very good golfer  but he had a disability. He had a bad leg  a circulatory problem  that made it very painful for him to walk the course. In fact  it carried risk of injury. He asked the PGA  the Professional Golfers' Association  for permission to use a golf cart in the PGA tournaments. They said   No. Now that would give you an unfair advantage.  He sued  and his case went all the way to the Supreme Court  believe it or not  the case over the golf cart  because the law says that the disabled must be accommodated  provided the accommodation does not change the essential nature of the activity. He says   I'm a great golfer. I want to compete. But I need a golf cart to get from one hole to the next.  Suppose you were on the Supreme Court. Suppose you were deciding the justice of this case. How many here would say that Casey Martin does have a right to use a golf cart  And how many say  no  he doesn't  All right  let's take a poll  show of hands. How many would rule in favor of Casey Martin  And how many would not  How many would say he doesn't  All right  we have a good division of opinion here. Someone who would not grant Casey Martin the right to a golf cart  what would be your reason  Raise your hand  and we'll try to get you a microphone. What would be your reason  MS  It would be an unfair advantage if he gets to ride in a golf cart. All right  those of you  I imagine most of you who would not give him the golf cart worry about an unfair advantage. What about those of you who say he should be given a golf cart  How would you answer the objection  Yes  all right. Audience  The cart's not part of the game. MS  What's your name   Audience  Charlie.  MS  Charlie says    We'll get Charlie a microphone in case someone wants to reply. Tell us  Charlie  why would you say he should be able to use a golf cart  Charlie  The cart's not part of the game. MS  But what about walking from hole to hole  Charlie  It doesn't matter  it's not part of the game. MS  Walking the course is not part of the game of golf  Charlie  Not in my book  it isn't. MS  All right. Stay there  Charlie. Who has an answer for Charlie  All right  who has an answer for Charlie  What would you say  Audience  The endurance element is a very important part of the game  walking all those holes. MS  Walking all those holes  That's part of the game of golf   Audience  Absolutely.  MS  What's your name   Audience  Warren.  MS  Warren. Charlie  what do you say to Warren  Charley  I'll stick to my original thesis. MS  Warren  are you a golfer  Warren  I am not a golfer. Charley  And I am.  MS  Okay.  You know  it's interesting. In the case  in the lower court  they brought in golfing greats to testify on this very issue. Is walking the course essential to the game  And they brought in Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer. And what do you suppose they all said  Yes. They agreed with Warren. They said  yes  walking the course is strenuous physical exercise. The fatigue factor is an important part of golf. And so it would change the fundamental nature of the game to give him the golf cart. Now  notice  something interesting    Well  I should tell you about the Supreme Court first. The Supreme Court decided. What do you suppose they said  They said yes  that Casey Martin must be provided a golf cart. Seven to two  they ruled. What was interesting about their ruling and about the discussion we've just had is that the discussion about the right  the justice  of the matter depended on figuring out what is the essential nature of golf. And the Supreme Court justices wrestled with that question. And Justice Stevens  writing for the majority  said he had read all about the history of golf  and the essential point of the game is to get very small ball from one place into a hole in as few strokes as possible  and that walking was not essential  but incidental. Now  there were two dissenters  one of whom was Justice Scalia. He wouldn't have granted the cart  and he had a very interesting dissent. It's interesting because he rejected the Aristotelian premise underlying the majority's opinion. He said it's not possible to determine the essential nature of a game like golf. Here's how he put it.  To say that something is essential is ordinarily to say that it is necessary to the achievement of a certain object. But since it is the very nature of a game to have no object except amusement  that is  what distinguishes games from productive activity  it is quite impossible to say that any of a game's arbitrary rules is essential.  So there you have Justice Scalia taking on the Aristotelian premise of the majority's opinion. Justice Scalia's opinion is questionable for two reasons. First  no real sports fan would talk that way. If we had thought that the rules of the sports we care about are merely arbitrary  rather than designed to call forth the virtues and the excellences that we think are worthy of admiring  we wouldn't care about the outcome of the game. It's also objectionable on a second ground. On the face of it  it seemed to be    this debate about the golf cart    an argument about fairness  what's an unfair advantage. But if fairness were the only thing at stake  there would have been an easy and obvious solution. What would it be   Audience  Let everyone use the cart.  Let everyone ride in a golf cart if they want to. Then the fairness objection goes away. But letting everyone ride in a cart would have been  I suspect  more anathema to the golfing greats and to the PGA  even than making an exception for Casey Martin. Why  Because what was at stake in the dispute over the golf cart was not only the essential nature of golf  but  relatedly  the question  What abilities are worthy of honor and recognition as athletic talents  Let me put the point as delicately as possible  Golfers are a little sensitive about the athletic status of their game. After all  there's no running or jumping  and the ball stands still. So if golfing is the kind of game that can be played while riding around in a golf cart  it would be hard to confer on the golfing greats the status that we confer  the honor and recognition that goes to truly great athletes. That illustrates that with golf  as with flutes  it's hard to decide the question of what justice requires  without grappling with the question   What is the essential nature of the activity in question  and what qualities  what excellences connected with that activity  are worthy of honor and recognition   Let's take a final example that's prominent in contemporary political debate  same sex marriage. There are those who favor state recognition only of traditional marriage between one man and one woman  and there are those who favor state recognition of same sex marriage. How many here favor the first policy  the state should recognize traditional marriage only  And how many favor the second  same sex marriage  Now  put it this way  What ways of thinking about justice and morality underlie the arguments we have over marriage  The opponents of same sex marriage say that the purpose of marriage  fundamentally  is procreation  and that's what's worthy of honoring and recognizing and encouraging. And the defenders of same sex marriage say no  procreation is not the only purpose of marriage  what about a lifelong  mutual  loving commitment  That's really what marriage is about. So with flutes  with golf carts  and even with a fiercely contested question like same sex marriage  Aristotle has a point. Very hard to argue about justice without first arguing about the purpose of social institutions and about what qualities are worthy of honor and recognition. So let's step back from these cases and see how they shed light on the way we might improve  elevate  the terms of political discourse in the United States  and for that matter  around the world. There is a tendency to think that if we engage too directly with moral questions in politics  that's a recipe for disagreement  and for that matter  a recipe for intolerance and coercion. So better to shy away from  to ignore  the moral and the religious convictions that people bring to civic life. It seems to me that our discussion reflects the opposite  that a better way to mutual respect is to engage directly with the moral convictions citizens bring to public life  rather than to require that people leave their deepest moral convictions outside politics before they enter. That  it seems to me  is a way to begin to restore the art of democratic argument. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks. Thank you. Chris. Thanks  Chris. Chris Anderson  From flutes to golf courses to same sex marriage    that was a genius link. Now look  you're a pioneer of open education. Your lecture series was one of the first to do it big. What's your vision for the next phase of this  MS  Well  I think that it is possible. In the classroom  we have arguments on some of the most fiercely held moral convictions that students have about big public questions. And I think we can do that in public life more generally. And so my real dream would be to take the public television series that we've created of the course    it's available now  online  free for everyone anywhere in the world    and to see whether we can partner with institutions  at universities in China  in India  in Africa  around the world  to try to promote civic education and also a richer kind of democratic debate. CA  So you picture  at some point  live  in real time  you could have this kind of conversation  inviting questions  but with people from China and India joining in  MS  Right. We did a little bit of it here with       people in Long Beach  and we do it in a classroom at Harvard with about       students. Wouldn't it be interesting to take this way of thinking and arguing  engaging seriously with big moral questions  exploring cultural differences and connect through a live video hookup  students in Beijing and Mumbai and in Cambridge  Massachusetts and create a global classroom. That's what I would love to do. CA  So  I would imagine that there are a lot of people who would love to join you in that endeavor. Michael Sandel. Thank you so much.  MS  Thanks so much.  In Africa we say   God gave the white man a watch and gave the black man time.  I think  how is it possible for a man with so much time to tell his story in    minutes  I think it will be quite a challenge for me. Most African stories these days  they talk about famine  HIV and AIDS  poverty or war. But my story that I would like to share with you today is the one about success. It is about a country in the southwest of Africa called Namibia. Namibia has got  .  million people  but it is only twice the size of California. I come from a region in the remote northwest part of the country. It's called Kunene region. And in the center of Kunene region is the village of Sesfontein. This is where I was born. This is where I'm coming from. Most people that are following the story of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt will know where Namibia is. They love Namibia for its beautiful dunes  that are even taller than the Empire State Building. Wind and time have twisted our landscape into very strange shapes  and these shapes are speckled with wildlife that has become so adapted to this harsh and strange land. I'm a Himba. You might wonder  why are you wearing these Western clothes  I'm a Himba and Namibian. A Himba is one of the    ethnic groups in Namibia. We live a very traditional lifestyle. I grew up herding  looking after our livestock    goats  sheep and cattle. And one day  my father actually took me into the bush. He said   John  I want you to become a good herder. Boy  if you are looking after our livestock and you see a cheetah eating our goat    cheetah is very nervous    just walk up to it. Walk up to it and smack it on the backside.   And he will let go of the goat and run off.  But then he said   Boy  if you run into a lion  don't move. Don't move. Stand your ground. Puff up and just look it in the eye and it may not want to fight you.  But then  he said   If you see a leopard  boy  you better run like hell.   Imagine you run faster than those goats you are looking after.  In this way    In this way  I actually started to learn about nature. In addition to being an ordinary Namibian and in addition to being a Himba I'm also a trained conservationist. And it is very important if you are in the field to know what to confront and what to run from. I was born in     . We lived under apartheid regime. The whites could farm  graze and hunt as they wished  but we black  we were not regarded as responsible to use wildlife. Whenever we tried to hunt  we were called poachers. And as a result  we were fined and locked up in jail. Between      and       the U.S. and Soviet interests fought for control over my country. And you know  during war time  there are militaries  armies  that are moving around. And the army hunted for valuable rhino horns and tusks. They could sell these things for anything between        a kilo. During the same year almost every Himba had a rifle. Because it was wartime  the British .    rifle was just all over the whole country. Then in the same time  around       we had a very big drought. It killed almost everything that was left. Our livestock was almost at the brink of extinction  protected as well. We were hungry. I remember a night when a hungry leopard went into the house of one of our neighbors and took a sleeping child out of the bed. It's a very sad story. But even today  that memory is still in people's minds. They can pinpoint the exact location where this all happened. And then  in the same year  we almost lost everything. And my father said   Why don't you just go to school   And they sent me off to school  just to get busy somewhere there. And the year I went to school  my father actually got a job with a non governmental organization called IRDNC  Integrated Rural Development and Nature Conservation. They actually spend a lot of time a year in the communities. They were trusted by the local communities like our leader  Joshua Kangombe. Joshua Kangombe saw what was happening  wildlife disappearing  poaching was skyrocketing  and the situation seemed very hopeless. Death and despair surrounded Joshua and our entire communities. But then  the people from IRDNC proposed to Joshua  What if we pay people that you trust to look after wildlife  Do you have anybody in your communities  or people  that know the bush very well and that know wildlife very well  The headman said   Yes. Our poachers.   Eh  The poachers    Yes. Our poachers.  And that was my father. My father has been a poacher for quite a long time. Instead of shooting poachers dead like they were doing elsewhere in Africa  IRDNC has helped men reclaim their abilities to manage their peoples and their rights to own and manage wildlife. And thus  as people started feeling ownership over wildlife  wildlife numbers started coming back  and that's actually becoming a foundation for conservation in Namibia. With independence  the whole approach of community getting involved was embraced by our new government. Three things that actually help to build on this foundation  The very first one is honoring of tradition and being open to new ideas. Here is our tradition  At every Himba village  there is a sacred fire. And at this sacred fire  the spirit of our ancestors speak through the headman and advise us where to get water  where to get grazings  and where to go and hunt. And I think this is the best way of regulating ourselves on the environment. And here are the new ideas. Transporting rhinos using helicopters I think is much easier than talking through a spirit that you can't see  isn't it  And these things we were taught by outsiders. We learned these things from outsiders. We needed new boundaries to describe our traditional lands  we needed to learn more things like GPS just to see whether    can GPS really reflect the true reflection of the land or is this just a thing made somewhere in the West  And we then wanted to see whether we can match our ancestral maps with digital maps made somewhere in the world. And through this  we actually started realizing our dreams  and we maintained honoring our traditions but we were still open to new ideas. The second element is that we wanted to have a life  a better life where we can benefit through many things. Most poachers  like my father  were people from our own community. They were not people from outside. These were our own people. And sometimes  once they were caught  they were treated with respect  brought back into the communities and they were made part of the bigger dreams. The best one  like my father    I'm not campaigning for my father    they were put in charge to stop others from poaching. And when this thing started going on  we started becoming one community  renewing our connection to nature. And that was a very strong thing in Namibia. The last element that actually helped develop these things was the partnerships. Our government has given legal status over our traditional lands. The other partners that we have got is business communities. Business communities helped bring Namibia onto the world map and they have also helped make wildlife a very valuable land use like any other land uses such as agriculture. And most of my conservation colleagues today that you find in Namibia have been trained through the initiative  through the involvement of World Wildlife Fund in the most up to date conservation practices. They have also given funding for two decades to this whole program. And so far  with the support of World Wildlife Fund  we've been able to scale up the very small programs to national programs today. Namibia ... or Sesfontein was no more an isolated village somewhere  hidden away in Namibia. With these assets we are now part of the global village. Thirty years have passed since my father's first job as a community game guard. It's very unfortunate that he passed away and he cannot see the success as I and my children see it today. When I finished school in       there were only    lions in the entire Northwest    in our area. But today  there are more than     lions. So please  if you go to Namibia  make sure that you stay in the tents. Don't walk out at night  The black rhino    they were almost extinct in     . But today  Kunene has the largest concentration of black rhino    free roaming black rhinos    in the world. This is outside the protected area. The leopard    they are now in big numbers but they are now far away from our village  because the natural plain has multiplied  like zebras  springboks and everything. They stay very much far away because this other thing has multiplied from less than a thousand to tens of thousands of animals. What started as very small  community rangers getting community involved  has now grown into something that we call conservancies. Conservancies are legally instituted institutions by the government  and these are run by the communities themselves  for their benefit. Today  we have got    conservancies that manage and protect over    million hectares of land in Namibia. We have already reshaped conservation in the entire country. Nowhere else in the world has community adopted conservation at this scale. In       conservancy generated  .  million dollars. This is our new economy    an economy based on the respect of our natural resources. And we are able to use this money for many things  Very importantly  we put it in education. Secondly  we put it for infrastructure. Food. Very important as well    we invest this money in AIDS and HIV education. You know that Africa is being affected by these viruses. And this is the good news from Africa that we have to shout from the rooftops. And now  what the world really needs is for you to help me and our partners take some of what we have learned in Namibia to other places with similar problems  places like Mongolia  or even in your own backyards  the Northern Great Plains  where buffalo and other animals have suffered and many communities are in decline. I like that one  Namibia serving as a model to Africa  and Africa serving as a model to the United States. We were successful in Namibia because we dreamed of a future that was much more than just a healthy wildlife. We knew conservation would fail if it doesn't work to improve the lives of the local communities. So  come and talk to me about Namibia  and better yet  come to Namibia and see for yourself how we have done it. And please  do visit our website to learn more and see how you can help CBNRM in Africa and across the world. Thank you very much. Those of you who may remember me from TEDGlobal remember me asking a few questions which still preoccupy me. One of them was  Why is it necessary to spend six billion pounds speeding up the Eurostar train when  for about    percent of that money  you could have top supermodels  male and female  serving free Chateau Petrus to all the passengers for the entire duration of the journey  You'd still have five billion left in change  and people would ask for the trains to be slowed down. Now  you may remember me asking the question as well  a very interesting observation  that actually those strange little signs that actually flash      at you  occasionally accompanying a little smiley face or a frown  according to whether you're within or outside the speed limit    those are actually more effective at preventing road accidents than speed cameras  which come with the actual threat of real punishment. So there seems to be a strange disproportionality at work  I think  in many areas of human problem solving  particularly those which involve human psychology  which is  The tendency of the organization or the institution is to deploy as much force as possible  as much compulsion as possible  whereas actually  the tendency of the person is to be almost influenced in absolute reverse proportion to the amount of force being applied. So there seems to be a complete disconnect here. So what I'm asking for is the creation of a new job title    I'll come to this a little later    and perhaps the addition of a new word into the English language. Because it does seem to me that large organizations including government  which is  of course  the largest organization of all  have actually become completely disconnected with what actually matters to people. Let me give you one example of this. You may remember this as the AOL Time Warner merger  okay  heralded at the time as the largest single deal of all time. It may still be  for all I know. Now  all of you in this room  in one form or other  are probably customers of one or both of those organizations that merged. Just interested  did anybody notice anything different as a result of this at all  So unless you happened to be a shareholder of one or the other organizations or one of the dealmakers or lawyers involved in the no doubt lucrative activity  you're actually engaging in a huge piece of activity that meant absolutely bugger all to anybody  okay  By contrast  years of marketing have taught me that if you actually want people to remember you and to appreciate what you do  the most potent things are actually very  very small. This is from Virgin Atlantic upper class  it's the cruet salt and pepper set. Quite nice in itself  they're little  sort of  airplane things. What's really  really sweet is every single person looking at these things has exactly the same mischievous thought  which is   I reckon I can heist these.  However  you pick them up and underneath  actually engraved in the metal  are the words   Stolen from Virgin Atlantic Airways upper class.  Now  years after you remember the strategic question of whether you're flying in a     or an Airbus  you remember those words and that experience. Similarly  this is from a hotel in Stockholm  the Lydmar. Has anybody stayed there  It's the lift  it's a series of buttons in the lift. Nothing unusual about that at all  except that these are actually not the buttons that take you to an individual floor. It starts with garage at the bottom  I suppose  appropriately  but it doesn't go up garage  grand floor  mezzanine  one  two  three  four. It actually says garage  funk  rhythm and blues. You have a series of buttons. You actually choose your lift music. My guess is that the cost of installing this in the lift in the Lydmar Hotel in Stockholm is probably     to       pounds max. It's frankly more memorable than all those millions of hotels we've all stayed at that tell you that your room has actually been recently renovated at a cost of         dollars  in order to make it resemble every other hotel room you've ever stayed in in the entire course of your life. Now  these are trivial marketing examples  I accept. But I was at a TED event recently and Esther Duflo  probably one of the leading experts in  effectively  the eradication of poverty in the developing world  actually spoke. And she came across a similar example of something that fascinated me as being something which  in a business context or a government context  would simply be so trivial a solution as to seem embarrassing. It was simply to encourage the inoculation of children by  not only making it a social event    I think good use of behavioral economics in that  if you turn up with several other mothers to have your child inoculated  your sense of confidence is much greater than if you turn up alone. But secondly  to incentivize that inoculation by giving a kilo of lentils to everybody who participated. It's a tiny  tiny thing. If you're a senior person at UNESCO and someone says   So what are you doing to eradicate world poverty   you're not really confident standing up there saying   I've got it cracked  it's the lentils   are you  Our own sense of self aggrandizement feels that big important problems need to have big important  and most of all  expensive solutions attached to them. And yet  what behavioral economics shows time after time after time is in human behavioral and behavioral change there's a very  very strong disproportionality at work  that actually what changes our behavior and what changes our attitude to things is not actually proportionate to the degree of expense entailed  or the degree of force that's applied. But everything about institutions makes them uncomfortable with that disproportionality. So what happens in an institution is the very person who has the power to solve the problem also has a very  very large budget. And once you have a very  very large budget  you actually look for expensive things to spend it on. What is completely lacking is a class of people who have immense amounts of power  but no money at all. It's those people I'd quite like to create in the world going forward. Now  here's another thing that happens  which is what I call sometimes  Terminal   syndrome   which is that big  expensive things get big  highly intelligent attention  and they're great  and Terminal   is absolutely magnificent  until you get down to the small detail  the usability  which is the signage  which is catastrophic. You come out of  Arrive  at the airport  and you follow a big yellow sign that says  Trains  and it's in front of you. So you walk for another hundred yards  expecting perhaps another sign  that might courteously be yellow  in front of you and saying  Trains.  No  no  no  the next one is actually blue  to your left  and says  Heathrow Express.  I mean  it could almost be rather like that scene from the film  Airplane.  A yellow sign  That's exactly what they'll be expecting. Actually  what happens in the world increasingly    now  all credit to the British Airport Authority. I spoke about this before  and a brilliant person got in touch with me and said   Okay  what can you do   So I did come up with five suggestions  which they are actually actioning. One of them also being  although logically it's quite a good idea to have a lift with no up and down button in it  if it only serves two floors  it's actually bloody terrifying  okay  Because when the door closes and there's nothing for you to do  you've actually just stepped into a Hammer film. So these questions ... what is happening in the world is the big stuff  actually  is done magnificently well. But the small stuff  what you might call the user interface  is done spectacularly badly. But also  there seems to be a complete sort of gridlock in terms of solving these small solutions. Because the people who can actually solve them actually are too powerful and too preoccupied with something they think of as  strategy  to actually solve them. I tried this exercise recently  talking about banking. They said   Can we do an advertising campaign  What can we do and encourage more online banking   I said   It's really  really easy.  I said   When people login to their online bank there are lots and lots of things they'd probably quite like to look at. The last thing in the world you ever want to see is your balance.  I've got friends who actually never use their own bank cash machines because there's the risk that it might display their balance on the screen. Why would you willingly expose yourself to bad news  Okay  you simply wouldn't. I said   If you make  actually  'Tell me my balance.' If you make that an option rather than the default  you'll find twice as many people log on to online banking  and they do it three times as often.  Let's face it  most of us    how many of you actually check your balance before you remove cash from a cash machine  And you're pretty rich by the standards of the world at large. Now  interesting that no single person does that  or at least can admit to being so anal as to do it. But what's interesting about that suggestion was that  to implement that suggestion wouldn't cost    million pounds  it wouldn't involve large amounts of expenditure  it would actually cost about    quid. And yet  it never happens. Because there's a fundamental disconnect  as I said  that actually  the people with the power want to do big expensive things. And there's to some extent a big strategy myth that's prevalent in business now. And if you think about it  it's very  very important that the strategy myth is maintained. Because  if the board of directors convince everybody that the success of any organization is almost entirely dependent on the decisions made by the board of directors  it makes the disparity in salaries slightly more justifiable than if you actually acknowledge that quite a lot of the credit for a company's success might actually lie somewhere else  in small pieces of tactical activity. But what is happening is that effectively    and the invention of the spreadsheet hasn't helped this  lots of things haven't helped this    business and government suffers from a kind of physics envy. It wants the world to be the kind of place where the input and the change are proportionate. It's a kind of mechanistic world that we'd all love to live in where  effectively  it sits very nicely on spreadsheets  everything is numerically expressible  and the amount you spend on something is proportionate to the scale of your success. That's the world people actually want. In truth  we do live in a world that science can understand. Unfortunately  the science is probably closer to being climatology in that in many cases  very  very small changes can have disproportionately huge effects  and equally  vast areas of activity  enormous mergers  can actually accomplish absolutely bugger all. But it's very  very uncomfortable for us to actually acknowledge that we're living in such a world. But what I'm saying is we could just make things a little bit better for ourselves if we looked at it in this very simple four way approach. That is actually strategy  and I'm not denying that strategy has a role. You know  there are cases where you spend quite a lot of money and you accomplish quite a lot. And I'd be wrong to dis that completely. Moving over  we come  of course  to consultancy. I thought it was very indecent of Accenture to ditch Tiger Woods in such a sort of hurried and hasty way. I mean  Tiger surely was actually obeying the Accenture model. He developed an interesting outsourcing model for sexual services  no longer tied to a single monopoly provider  in many cases  sourcing things locally  and of course  the ability to have between one and three girls delivered at any time led for better load balancing. So what Accenture suddenly found so unattractive about that  I'm not sure. Then there are other things that don't cost much and achieve absolutely nothing. That's called trivia. But there's a fourth thing. And the fundamental problem is we don't actually have a word for this stuff. We don't know what to call it. And actually we don't spend nearly enough money looking for those things  looking for those tiny things that may or may not work  but which  if they do work  can have a success absolutely out of proportion to their expense  their efforts and the disruption they cause. So the first thing I'd like is a competition    to anybody watching this as a film    is to come up with a name for that stuff on the bottom right. And the second thing  I think  is that the world needs to have people in charge of that. That's why I call for the  Chief Detail Officer.  Every corporation should have one  and every government should have a Ministry of Detail. The people who actually have no money  who have no extravagant budget  but who realize that actually you might achieve greater success in uptake of a government program by actually doubling the level of benefits you pay  but you'll probably achieve exactly that same effect simply by redesigning the form and writing it in comprehensible English. And if actually we created a Ministry of Detail and business actually had Chief Detail Officers  then that fourth quadrant  which is so woefully neglected at the moment  might finally get the attention it deserves. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  We're having a debate. The debate is over the proposition   What the world needs now is nuclear energy.  True or false  And before we have the debate  I'd like to actually take a show of hands    on balance  right now  are you for or against this  So those who are  yes   raise your hand.  For.  Okay  hands down. Those who are against  raise your hands. Okay  I'm reading that at about    to    in favor at the start. Which means we're going to take a vote at the end and see how that shifts  if at all. So here's the format  They're going to have six minutes each  and then after one little  quick exchange between them  I want two people on each side of this debate in the audience to have    seconds to make one short  crisp  pungent  powerful point. So  in favor of the proposition  possibly shockingly  is one of  truly  the founders of the environmental movement  a long standing TEDster  the founder of the Whole Earth Catalog  someone we all know and love  Stewart Brand. Stewart Brand  Whoa. The saying is that with climate  those who know the most are the most worried. With nuclear  those who know the most are the least worried. A classic example is James Hansen  a NASA climatologist pushing for     parts per million carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. He came out with a wonderful book recently called  Storms of My Grandchildren.  And Hansen is hard over for nuclear power  as are most climatologists who are engaging this issue seriously. This is the design situation  a planet that is facing climate change and is now half urban. Look at the client base for this. Five out of six of us live in the developing world. We are moving to cities. We are moving up in the world. And we are educating our kids  having fewer kids  basically good news all around. But we move to cities  toward the bright lights  and one of the things that is there that we want  besides jobs  is electricity. And if it isn't easily gotten  we'll go ahead and steal it. This is one of the most desired things by poor people all over the world  in the cities and in the countryside. Electricity for cities  at its best  is what's called baseload electricity. That's where it is on all the time. And so far there are only three major sources of that    coal and gas  hydro electric  which in most places is maxed out    and nuclear. I would love to have something in the fourth place here  but in terms of constant  clean  scalable energy   solar  and wind and the other renewables aren't there yet because they're inconstant. Nuclear is and has been for    years. Now  from an environmental standpoint  the main thing you want to look at is what happens to the waste from nuclear and from coal  the two major sources of electricity. If all of your electricity in your lifetime came from nuclear  the waste from that lifetime of electricity would go in a Coke can    a pretty heavy Coke can  about two pounds. But one day of coal adds up to one hell of a lot of carbon dioxide in a normal one gigawatt coal fired plant. Then what happens to the waste  The nuclear waste typically goes into a dry cask storage out back of the parking lot at the reactor site because most places don't have underground storage yet. It's just as well  because it can stay where it is. While the carbon dioxide  vast quantities of it  gigatons  goes into the atmosphere where we can't get it back    yet    and where it is causing the problems that we're most concerned about. So when you add up the greenhouse gases in the lifetime of these various energy sources  nuclear is down there with wind and hydro  below solar and way below  obviously  all the fossil fuels. Wind is wonderful  I love wind. I love being around these big wind generators. But one of the things we're discovering is that wind  like solar  is an actually relatively dilute source of energy. And so it takes a very large footprint on the land  a very large footprint in terms of materials  five to    times what you'd use for nuclear  and typically to get one gigawatt of electricity is on the order of     square miles of wind farm. In places like Denmark and Germany  they've maxed out on wind already. They've run out of good sites. The power lines are getting overloaded. And you peak out. Likewise  with solar  especially here in California  we're discovering that the    solar farm schemes that are going forward want to basically bulldoze       square miles of southern California desert. Well  as an environmentalist  we would rather that didn't happen. It's okay on frapped out agricultural land. Solar's wonderful on rooftops. But out in the landscape  one gigawatt is on the order of    square miles of bulldozed desert. When you add all these things up    Saul Griffith did the numbers and figured out what would it take to get    clean terawatts of energy from wind  solar and biofuels  and that area would be roughly the size of the United States  an area he refers to as  Renewistan.  A guy who's added it up all this very well is David Mackay  a physicist in England  and in his wonderful book   Sustainable Energy   among other things  he says   I'm not trying to be pro nuclear. I'm just pro arithmetic.  In terms of weapons  the best disarmament tool so far is nuclear energy. We have been taking down the Russian warheads  turning it into electricity. Ten percent of American electricity comes from decommissioned warheads. We haven't even started the American stockpile. I think of most interest to a TED audience would be the new generation of reactors that are very small  down around    to     megawatts. This is one from Toshiba. Here's one the Russians are already building that floats on a barge. And that would be very interesting in the developing world. Typically  these things are put in the ground. They're referred to as nuclear batteries. They're incredibly safe  weapons proliferation proof and all the rest of it. Here is a commercial version from New Mexico called the Hyperion  and another one from Oregon called NuScale. Babcock   Wilcox that make nuclear reactors  here's an integral fast reactor. Thorium reactor that Nathan Myhrvold's involved in. The governments of the world are going to have to decide that coals need to be made expensive  and these will go ahead. And here's the future. CA  Okay. Okay. So arguing against  a man who's been at the nitty  gritty heart of the energy debate and the climate change debate for years. In       he discovered that soot was probably the second leading cause of global warming  after CO . His team have been making detailed calculations of the relative impacts of different energy sources. His first time at TED  possibly a disadvantage    we shall see    from Stanford  Professor Mark Jacobson. Good luck. Mark Jacobson  Thank you. So my premise here is that nuclear energy puts out more carbon dioxide  puts out more air pollutants  enhances mortality more and takes longer to put up than real renewable energy systems  namely wind  solar  geothermal power  hydro tidal wave power. And it also enhances nuclear weapons proliferation. So let's start just by looking at the CO  emissions from the life cycle. CO e emissions are equivalent emissions of all the greenhouse gases and particles that cause warming and converted to CO . And if you look  wind and concentrated solar have the lowest CO  emissions  if you look at the graph. Nuclear    there are two bars here. One is a low estimate  and one is a high estimate. The low estimate is the nuclear energy industry estimate of nuclear. The high is the average of     scientific  peer reviewed studies. And this is just the CO  from the life cycle. If we look at the delays  it takes between    and    years to put up a nuclear power plant from planning to operation. This includes about three and a half to six years for a site permit. and another two and a half to four years for a construction permit and issue  and then four to nine years for actual construction. And in China  right now  they're putting up five gigawatts of nuclear. And the average  just for the construction time of these  is  .  years on top of any planning times. While you're waiting around for your nuclear  you have to run the regular electric power grid  which is mostly coal in the United States and around the world. And the chart here shows the difference between the emissions from the regular grid  resulting if you use nuclear  or anything else  versus wind  CSP or photovoltaics. Wind takes about two to five years on average  same as concentrated solar and photovoltaics. So the difference is the opportunity cost of using nuclear versus wind  or something else. So if you add these two together  alone  you can see a separation that nuclear puts out at least nine to    times more CO  equivalent emissions than wind energy. And this doesn't even account for the footprint on the ground. If you look at the air pollution health effects  this is the number of deaths per year in      just from vehicle exhaust. Let's say we converted all the vehicles in the United States to battery electric vehicles  hydrogen fuel cell vehicles or flex fuel vehicles run on E  . Well  right now in the United States     to         people die per year from air pollution  and vehicles are about        of those. In       the number will go down to        due to improvements. And so  on the right  you see gasoline emissions  the death rates of     . If you go to corn or cellulosic ethanol  you'd actually increase the death rate slightly. If you go to nuclear  you do get a big reduction  but it's not as much as with wind and concentrated solar. Now if you consider the fact that nuclear weapons proliferation is associated with nuclear energy proliferation  because we know for example  India and Pakistan developed nuclear weapons secretly by enriching uranium in nuclear energy facilities. North Korea did that to some extent. Iran is doing that right now. And Venezuela would be doing it if they started with their nuclear energy facilities. If you do a large scale expansion of nuclear energy across the world  and as a result there was just one nuclear bomb created that was used to destroy a city such as Mumbai or some other big city  megacity  the additional death rates due to this averaged over    years and then scaled to the population of the U.S. would be this. So  do we need this  The next thing is  What about the footprint  Stewart mentioned the footprint. Actually  the footprint on the ground for wind is by far the smallest of any energy source in the world. That  because the footprint  as you can see  is just the pole touching the ground. And you can power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet with        to         five megawatt wind turbines. That would take between one and three square kilometers of footprint on the ground  entirely. The spacing is something else. That's the footprint that is always being confused. People confuse footprint with spacing. As you can see from these pictures  the spacing between can be used for multiple purposes including agricultural land  range land or open space. Over the ocean  it's not even land. Now if we look at nuclear     Laughter  With nuclear  what do we have  We have facilities around there. You also have a buffer zone that's    square kilometers. And you have the uranium mining that you have to deal with. Now if we go to the area  lots is worse than nuclear or wind. For example  cellulosic ethanol  to power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet  this is how much land you would need. That's cellulosic  second generation biofuels from prairie grass. Here's corn ethanol. It's smaller. This is based on ranges from data  but if you look at nuclear  it would be the size of Rhode Island to power the U.S. vehicle fleet. For wind  there's a larger area  but much smaller footprint. And of course  with wind  you could put it all over the East Coast  offshore theoretically  or you can split it up. And now  if you go back to looking at geothermal  it's even smaller than both  and solar is slightly larger than the nuclear spacing  but it's still pretty small. And this is to power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet. To power the entire world with    percent wind  you would need about one percent of world land. Matching the reliability  base load is actually irrelevant. We want to match the hour by hour power supply. You can do that by combining renewables. This is from real data in California  looking at wind data and solar data. And it considers just using existing hydro to match the hour by hour power demand. Here are the world wind resources. There's five to    times more wind available worldwide than we need for all the world. So then here's the final ranking. And one last slide I just want to show. This is the choice  You can either have wind or nuclear. If you use wind  you guarantee ice will last. Nuclear  the time lag alone will allow the Arctic to melt and other places to melt more. And we can guarantee a clean  blue sky or an uncertain future with nuclear power. CA  All right. So while they're having their comebacks on each other    and yours is slightly short because you slightly overran    I need two people from either side. So if you're for this  if you're for nuclear power  put up two hands. If you're against  put up one. And I want two of each for the mics. Now then  you guys have    you have a minute comeback on him to pick up a point he said  challenge it  whatever. SB  I think a point of difference we're having  Mark  has to do with weapons and energy. These diagrams that show that nuclear is somehow putting out a lot of greenhouse gases    a lot of those studies include   Well of course war will be inevitable and therefore we'll have cities burning and stuff like that   which is kind of finessing it a little bit  I think. The reality is that there's  what     nations that have nuclear power  Of those  seven have nuclear weapons. In every case  they got the weapons before they got the nuclear power. There are two nations  North Korea and Israel  that have nuclear weapons and don't have nuclear power at all. The places that we would most like to have really clean energy occur are China  India  Europe  North America  all of which have sorted out their situation in relation to nuclear weapons. So that leaves a couple of places like Iran  maybe Venezuela  that you would like to have very close surveillance of anything that goes on with fissile stuff. Pushing ahead with nuclear power will mean we really know where all of the fissile material is  and we can move toward zero weapons left  once we know all that. CA  Mark     seconds  either on that or on anything Stewart said. MJ  Well we know India and Pakistan had nuclear energy first  and then they developed nuclear weapons secretly in the factories. So the other thing is  we don't need nuclear energy. There's plenty of solar and wind. You can make it reliable  as I showed with that diagram. That's from real data. And this is an ongoing research. This is not rocket science. Solving the world's problems can be done  if you really put your mind to it and use clean  renewable energy. There's absolutely no need for nuclear power. CA  We need someone for. Rod Beckstrom  Thank you Chris. I'm Rod Beckstrom  CEO of ICANN. I've been involved in global warming policy since       when I joined the board of Environmental Defense Fund that was one of the crafters of the Kyoto Protocol. And I want to support Stewart Brand's position. I've come around in the last    years. I used to be against nuclear power. I'm now supporting Stewart's position  softly  from a risk management standpoint  agreeing that the risks of overheating the planet outweigh the risk of nuclear incident  which certainly is possible and is a very real problem. However  I think there may be a win win solution here where both parties can win this debate  and that is  we face a situation where it's carbon caps on this planet or die. And in the United States Senate  we need bipartisan support    only one or two votes are needed    to move global warming through the Senate  and this room can help. So if we get that through  then Mark will solve these problems. Thanks Chris. CA  Thank you Rod Beckstrom. Against. David Fanton  Hi  I'm David Fanton. I just want to say a couple quick things. The first is  be aware of the propaganda. The propaganda from the industry has been very  very strong. And we have not had the other side of the argument fully aired so that people can draw their own conclusions. Be very aware of the propaganda. Secondly  think about this. If we build all these nuclear power plants  all that waste is going to be on hundreds  if not thousands  of trucks and trains  moving through this country every day. Tell me they're not going to have accidents. Tell me that those accidents aren't going to put material into the environment that is poisonous for hundreds of thousands of years. And then tell me that each and every one of those trucks and trains isn't a potential terrorist target. CA  Thank you. For. Anyone else for  Go. Alex  Hi  I'm Alex. I just wanted to say  I'm  first of all  renewable energy's biggest fan. I've got solar PV on my roof. I've got a hydro conversion at a watermill that I own. And I'm  you know  very much  pro  that kind of stuff. However  there's a basic arithmetic problem here. The capability of the sun shining  the wind blowing and the rain falling  simply isn't enough to add up. So if we want to keep the lights on  we actually need a solution which is going to keep generating all of the time. I campaigned against nuclear weapons in the '  s  and I continue to do so now. But we've got an opportunity to recycle them into something more useful that enables us to get energy all of the time. And  ultimately  the arithmetic problem isn't going to go away. We're not going to get enough energy from renewables alone. We need a solution that generates all of the time. If we're going to keep the lights on  nuclear is that solution. CA  Thank you. Anyone else against  Man  The last person who was in favor made the premise that we don't have enough alternative renewable resources. And our  against  proponent up here made it very clear that we actually do. And so the fallacy that we need this resource and we can actually make it in a time frame that is meaningful is not possible. I will also add one other thing. Ray Kurzweil and all the other talks    we know that the stick is going up exponentially. So you can't look at state of the art technologies in renewables and say   That's all we have.  Because five years from now  it will blow you away what we'll actually have as alternatives to this horrible  disastrous nuclear power. CA  Point well made. Thank you. So each of you has really just a couple sentences       seconds each to sum up. Your final pitch  Stewart. SB  I loved your  It all balances out  chart that you had there. It was a sunny day and a windy night. And just now in England they had a cold spell. All of the wind in the entire country shut down for a week. None of those things were stirring. And as usual  they had to buy nuclear power from France. Two gigawatts comes through the Chunnel. This keeps happening. I used to worry about the        year factor. And the fact is  we're going to use the nuclear waste we have for fuel in the fourth generation of reactors that are coming along. And especially the small reactors need to go forward. I heard from Nathan Myhrvold    and I think here's the action point    it'll take an act of Congress to make the Nuclear Regulatory Commission start moving quickly on these small reactors  which we need very much  here and in the world. MJ  So we've analyzed the hour by hour power demand and supply  looking at solar  wind  using data for California. And you can match that demand  hour by hour  for the whole year almost. Now  with regard to the resources  we've developed the first wind map of the world  from data alone  at    meters. We know what the wind resources are. You can cover    percent. Fifteen percent of the entire U.S. has wind at fast enough speeds to be cost competitive. And there's much more solar than there is wind. There's plenty of resource. You can make it reliable. CA  Okay. So  thank you  Mark. So if you were in Palm Springs ... Shameless. Shameless. Shameless. So  people of the TED community  I put it to you that what the world needs now is nuclear energy. All those in favor  raise your hands. And all those against. Ooooh. Now that is    my take on that ... Just put up ... Hands up  people who changed their minds during the debate  who voted differently. Those of you who changed your mind in favor of  for  put your hands up. Okay. So here's the read on it. Both people won supporters  but on my count  the mood of the TED community shifted from about    to    to about    to    in favor  in favor. You both won. I congratulate both of you. Thank you for that. This is the venue where  as a young man  some of the music that I wrote was first performed. It was  remarkably  a pretty good sounding room. With all the uneven walls and all the crap everywhere  it actually sounded pretty good. This is a song that was recorded there. This is not Talking Heads  in the picture anyway. So the nature of the room meant that words could be understood. The lyrics of the songs could be pretty much understood. The sound system was kind of decent. And there wasn't a lot of reverberation in the room. So the rhythms could be pretty intact too  pretty concise. Other places around the country had similar rooms. This is Tootsie's Orchid Lounge in Nashville. The music was in some ways different  but in structure and form  very much the same. The clientele behavior was very much the same too. And so the bands at Tootsie's or at CBGB's had to play loud enough    the volume had to be loud enough to overcome people falling down  shouting out and doing whatever else they were doing. Since then  I've played other places that are much nicer. I've played the Disney Hall here and Carnegie Hall and places like that. And it's been very exciting. But I also noticed that sometimes the music that I had written  or was writing at the time  didn't sound all that great in some of those halls. We managed  but sometimes those halls didn't seem exactly suited to the music I was making or had made. So I asked myself  Do I write stuff for specific rooms  Do I have a place  a venue  in mind when I write  Is that a kind of model for creativity  Do we all make things with a venue  a context  in mind  Okay  Africa. Most of the popular music that we know now has a big part of its roots in West Africa. And the music there  I would say  the instruments  the intricate rhythms  the way it's played  the setting  the context  it's all perfect. It all works perfect. The music works perfectly in that setting. There's no big room to create reverberation and confuse the rhythms. The instruments are loud enough that they can be heard without amplification  etc.  etc. It's no accident. It's perfect for that particular context. And it would be a mess in a context like this. This is a gothic cathedral. In a gothic cathedral  this kind of music is perfect. It doesn't change key  the notes are long  there's almost no rhythm whatsoever  and the room flatters the music. It actually improves it. This is the room that Bach wrote some of his music for. This is the organ. It's not as big as a gothic cathedral  so he can write things that are a little bit more intricate. He can  very innovatively  actually change keys without risking huge dissonances. This is a little bit later. This is the kind of rooms that Mozart wrote in. I think we're in like       somewhere around there. They're smaller  even less reverberant  so he can write really frilly music that's very intricate    and it works. It fits the room perfectly. This is La Scala. It's around the same time  I think it was built around     . People in the audience in these opera houses  when they were built  they used to yell out to one another. They used to eat  drink and yell out to people on the stage  just like they do at CBGB's and places like that. If they liked an aria  they would holler and suggest that it be done again as an encore  not at the end of the show  but immediately. And well  that was an opera experience. This is the opera house that Wagner built for himself. And the size of the room is not that big. It's smaller than this. But Wagner made an innovation. He wanted a bigger band. He wanted a little more bombast  so he increased the size of the orchestra pit so he could get more low end instruments in there. Okay. This is Carnegie Hall. Obviously  this kind of thing became popular. The halls got bigger. Carnegie Hall's fair sized. It's larger than some of the other symphony halls. And they're a lot more reverberant than La Scala. Around the same  according to Alex Ross who writes for the New Yorker  this kind of rule came into effect that audiences had to be quiet    no more eating  drinking and yelling at the stage  or gossiping with one another during the show. They had to be very quiet. So those two things combined meant that a different kind of music worked best in these kind of halls. It meant that there could be extreme dynamics  which there weren't in some of these other kinds of music. Quiet parts could be heard that would have been drowned out by all the gossiping and shouting. But because of the reverberation in those rooms like Carnegie Hall  the music had to be maybe a little less rhythmic and a little more textural. This is Mahler. It looks like Bob Dylan  but it's Mahler. That was Bob's last record  yeah. Popular music  coming along at the same time. This is a jazz band. According to Scott Joplin  the bands were playing on riverboats and clubs. Again  it's noisy. They're playing for dancers. There's certain sections of the song    the songs had different sections that the dancers really liked. And they'd say   Play that part again.  Well  there's only so many times you can play the same section of a song over and over again for the dancers. So the bands started to improvise new melodies. And a new form of music was born. These are played mainly in small rooms. People are dancing  shouting and drinking. So the music has to be loud enough to be heard above that. Same thing goes true for    that's the beginning of the century    for the whole of   th century popular music  whether it's rock or Latin music or whatever.  Live music  doesn't really change that much. It changes about a third of the way into the   th century  when this became one of the primary venues for music. And this was one way that the music got there. Microphones enabled singers  in particular  and musicians and composers  to completely change the kind of music that they were writing. So far  a lot of the stuff that was on the radio was live music  but singers  like Frank Sinatra  could use the mic and do things that they could never do without a microphone. Other singers after him went even further. This is Chet Baker. And this kind of thing would have been impossible without a microphone. It would have been impossible without recorded music as well. And he's singing right into your ear. He's whispering into your ears. The effect is just electric. It's like the guy is sitting next to you  whispering who knows what into your ear. So at this point  music diverged. There's live music  and there's recorded music. And they no longer have to be exactly the same. Now there's venues like this  a discotheque  and there's jukeboxes in bars  where you don't even need to have a band. There doesn't need to be any live performing musicians whatsoever  and the sound systems are good. People began to make music specifically for discos and for those sound systems. And  as with jazz  the dancers liked certain sections more than they did others. So the early hip hop guys would loop certain sections. The MC would improvise lyrics in the same way that the jazz players would improvise melodies. And another new form of music was born. Live performance  when it was incredibly successful  ended up in what is probably  acoustically  the worst sounding venues on the planet  sports stadiums  basketball arenas and hockey arenas. Musicians who ended up there did the best they could. They wrote what is now called arena rock  which is medium speed ballads. They did the best they could given that this is what they're writing for. The tempos are medium. It sounds big. It's more a social situation than a musical situation. And in some ways  the music that they're writing for this place works perfectly. So there's more new venues. One of the new ones is the automobile. I grew up with a radio in a car. But now that's evolved into something else. The car is a whole venue. The music that  I would say  is written for automobile sound systems works perfectly on it. It might not be what you want to listen to at home  but it works great in the car    has a huge frequency spectrum  you know  big bass and high end and the voice kind of stuck in the middle. Automobile music  you can share with your friends. There's one other kind of new venue  the private MP  player. Presumably  this is just for Christian music. And in some ways it's like Carnegie Hall  or when the audience had to hush up  because you can now hear every single detail. In other ways  it's more like the West African music because if the music in an MP  player gets too quiet  you turn it up  and the next minute  your ears are blasted out by a louder passage. So that doesn't really work. I think pop music  mainly  it's written today  to some extent  is written for these kind of players  for this kind of personal experience where you can hear extreme detail  but the dynamic doesn't change that much. So I asked myself  Okay  is this a model for creation  this adaptation that we do  And does it happen anywhere else  Well  according to David Attenborough and some other people  birds do it too    that the birds in the canopy  where the foliage is dense  their calls tend to be high pitched  short and repetitive. And the birds on the floor tend to have lower pitched calls  so that they don't get distorted when they bounce off the forest floor. And birds like this Savannah sparrow  they tend to have a buzzing type call. And it turns out that a sound like this is the most energy efficient and practical way to transmit their call across the fields and savannahs. Other birds  like this tanager  have adapted within the same species. The tananger on the East Coast of the United States  where the forests are a little denser  has one kind of call  and the tananger on the other side  on the west has a different kind of call. So birds do it too. And I thought  Well  if this is a model for creation  if we make music  primarily the form at least  to fit these contexts  and if we make art to fit gallery walls or museum walls  and if we write software to fit existing operating systems  is that how it works  Yeah. I think it's evolutionary. It's adaptive. But the pleasure and the passion and the joy is still there. This is a reverse view of things from the kind of traditional Romantic view. The Romantic view is that first comes the passion and then the outpouring of emotion  and then somehow it gets shaped into something. And I'm saying  well  the passion's still there  but the vessel that it's going to be injected into and poured into  that is instinctively and intuitively created first. We already know where that passion is going. But this conflict of views is kind of interesting. The writer  Thomas Frank  says that this might be a kind of explanation why some voters vote against their best interests  that voters  like a lot of us  assume  that if they hear something that sounds like it's sincere  that it's coming from the gut  that it's passionate  that it's more authentic. And they'll vote for that. So that  if somebody can fake sincerity  if they can fake passion  they stand a better chance of being selected in that way  which seems a little dangerous. I'm saying the two  the passion  the joy  are not mutually exclusive. Maybe what the world needs now is for us to realize that we are like the birds. We adapt. We sing. And like the birds  the joy is still there  even though we have changed what we do to fit the context. Thank you very much. So since I was here last in '    we discovered that global climate change is turning out to be a pretty serious issue  so we covered that fairly extensively in Skeptic magazine. We investigate all kinds of scientific and quasi scientific controversies  but it turns out we don't have to worry about any of this because the world's going to end in     . Another update  You will recall I introduced you guys to the Quadro Tracker. It's like a water dowsing device. It's just a hollow piece of plastic with an antenna that swivels around. And you walk around  and it points to things. Like if you're looking for marijuana in students' lockers  it'll point right to somebody. Oh  sorry.  Laughter  This particular one that was given to me finds golf balls  especially if you're at a golf course and you check under enough bushes. Well  under the category of  What's the harm of silly stuff like this   this device  the ADE      was sold to the Iraqi government for        dollars apiece. It's just like this one  completely worthless  in which it allegedly worked by  electrostatic magnetic ion attraction   which translates to  pseudoscientific baloney     would be the nice word    in which you string together a bunch of words that sound good  but it does absolutely nothing. In this case  at trespass points  allowing people to go through because your little tracker device said they were okay  actually cost lives. So there is a danger to pseudoscience  in believing in this sort of thing. So what I want to talk about today is belief. I want to believe  and you do too. And in fact  I think my thesis here is that belief is the natural state of things. It is the default option. We just believe. We believe all sorts of things. Belief is natural  disbelief  skepticism  science  is not natural. It's more difficult. It's uncomfortable to not believe things. So like Fox Mulder on  X Files   who wants to believe in UFOs  Well  we all do  and the reason for that is because we have a belief engine in our brains. Essentially  we are pattern seeking primates. We connect the dots  A is connected to B  B is connected to C. And sometimes A really is connected to B  and that's called association learning. We find patterns  we make those connections  whether it's Pavlov's dog here associating the sound of the bell with the food  and then he salivates to the sound of the bell  or whether it's a Skinnerian rat  in which he's having an association between his behavior and a reward for it  and therefore he repeats the behavior. In fact  what Skinner discovered is that  if you put a pigeon in a box like this  and he has to press one of these two keys  and he tries to figure out what the pattern is  and you give him a little reward in the hopper box there    if you just randomly assign rewards such that there is no pattern  they will figure out any kind of pattern. And whatever they were doing just before they got the reward  they repeat that particular pattern. Sometimes it was even spinning around twice counterclockwise  once clockwise and peck the key twice. And that's called superstition  and that  I'm afraid  we will always have with us. I call this process  patternicity     that is  the tendency to find meaningful patterns in both meaningful and meaningless noise. When we do this process  we make two types of errors. A Type I error  or false positive  is believing a pattern is real when it's not. Our second type of error is a false negative. A Type II error is not believing a pattern is real when it is. So let's do a thought experiment. You are a hominid three million years ago walking on the plains of Africa. Your name is Lucy  okay  And you hear a rustle in the grass. Is it a dangerous predator  or is it just the wind  Your next decision could be the most important one of your life. Well  if you think that the rustle in the grass is a dangerous predator and it turns out it's just the wind  you've made an error in cognition  made a Type I error  false positive. But no harm. You just move away. You're more cautious. You're more vigilant. On the other hand  if you believe that the rustle in the grass is just the wind  and it turns out it's a dangerous predator  you're lunch. You've just won a Darwin award. You've been taken out of the gene pool. Now the problem here is that patternicities will occur whenever the cost of making a Type I error is less than the cost of making a Type II error. This is the only equation in the talk by the way. We have a pattern detection problem that is assessing the difference between a Type I and a Type II error is highly problematic  especially in split second  life and death situations. So the default position is just  Believe all patterns are real    All rustles in the grass are dangerous predators and not just the wind. And so I think that we evolved ... there was a natural selection for the propensity for our belief engines  our pattern seeking brain processes  to always find meaningful patterns and infuse them with these sort of predatory or intentional agencies that I'll come back to. So for example  what do you see here  It's a horse head  that's right. It looks like a horse. It must be a horse. That's a pattern. And is it really a horse  Or is it more like a frog  See  our pattern detection device  which appears to be located in the anterior cingulate cortex    it's our little detection device there    can be easily fooled  and this is the problem. For example  what do you see here  Yes  of course  it's a cow. Once I prime the brain    it's called cognitive priming    once I prime the brain to see it  it pops back out again even without the pattern that I've imposed on it. And what do you see here  Some people see a Dalmatian dog. Yes  there it is. And there's the prime. So when I go back without the prime  your brain already has the model so you can see it again. What do you see here  Planet Saturn. Yes  that's good. How about here  Just shout out anything you see. That's a good audience  Chris. Because there's nothing in this. Well  allegedly there's nothing. This is an experiment done by Jennifer Whitson at U.T. Austin on corporate environments and whether feelings of uncertainty and out of control makes people see illusory patterns. That is  almost everybody sees the planet Saturn. People that are put in a condition of feeling out of control are more likely to see something in this  which is allegedly patternless. In other words  the propensity to find these patterns goes up when there's a lack of control. For example  baseball players are notoriously superstitious when they're batting  but not so much when they're fielding. Because fielders are successful    to    percent of the time. The best batters fail seven out of    times. So their superstitions  their patternicities  are all associated with feelings of lack of control and so forth. What do you see in this particular one here  in this field  Anybody see an object there  There actually is something here  but it's degraded. While you're thinking about that  this was an experiment done by Susan Blackmore  a psychologist in England  who showed subjects this degraded image and then ran a correlation between their scores on an ESP test  How much did they believe in the paranormal  supernatural  angels and so forth. And those who scored high on the ESP scale  tended to not only see more patterns in the degraded images but incorrect patterns. Here is what you show subjects. The fish is degraded    percent     percent and then the one I showed you     percent. A similar experiment was done by another  Swiss  psychologist named Peter Brugger  who found significantly more meaningful patterns were perceived on the right hemisphere  via the left visual field  than the left hemisphere. So if you present subjects the images such that it's going to end up on the right hemisphere instead of the left  then they're more likely to see patterns than if you put it on the left hemisphere. Our right hemisphere appears to be where a lot of this patternicity occurs. So what we're trying to do is bore into the brain to see where all this happens. Brugger and his colleague  Christine Mohr  gave subjects L DOPA. L DOPA's a drug  as you know  given for treating Parkinson's disease  which is related to a decrease in dopamine. L DOPA increases dopamine. An increase of dopamine caused subjects to see more patterns than those that did not receive the dopamine. So dopamine appears to be the drug associated with patternicity. In fact  neuroleptic drugs that are used to eliminate psychotic behavior  things like paranoia  delusions and hallucinations  these are patternicities. They're incorrect patterns. They're false positives. They're Type I errors. And if you give them drugs that are dopamine antagonists  they go away. That is  you decrease the amount of dopamine  and their tendency to see patterns like that decreases. On the other hand  amphetamines like cocaine are dopamine agonists. They increase the amount of dopamine. So you're more likely to feel in a euphoric state  creativity  find more patterns. In fact  I saw Robin Williams recently talk about how he thought he was much funnier when he was doing cocaine  when he had that issue  than now. So perhaps more dopamine is related to more creativity. Dopamine  I think  changes our signal to noise ratio. That is  how accurate we are in finding patterns. If it's too low  you're more likely to make too many Type II errors. You miss the real patterns. You don't want to be too skeptical. If you're too skeptical  you'll miss the really interesting good ideas. Just right  you're creative  and yet you don't fall for too much baloney. Too high and maybe you see patterns everywhere. Every time somebody looks at you  you think people are staring at you. You think people are talking about you. And if you go too far on that  that's just simply labeled as madness. It's a distinction perhaps we might make between two Nobel laureates  Richard Feynman and John Nash. One sees maybe just the right number of patterns to win a Nobel Prize. The other one also  but maybe too many patterns. And we then call that schizophrenia. So the signal to noise ratio then presents us with a pattern detection problem. And of course you all know exactly what this is  right  And what pattern do you see here  Again  I'm putting your anterior cingulate cortex to the test here  causing you conflicting pattern detections. You know  of course  this is Via Uno shoes. These are sandals. Pretty sexy feet  I must say. Maybe a little Photoshopped. And of course  the ambiguous figures that seem to flip flop back and forth. It turns out what you're thinking about a lot influences what you tend to see. And you see the lamp here  I know. Because the lights on here. Of course  thanks to the environmentalist movement we're all sensitive to the plight of marine mammals. So what you see in this particular ambiguous figure is  of course  the dolphins  right  You see a dolphin here  and there's a dolphin  and there's a dolphin. That's a dolphin tail there  guys. If we can give you conflicting data  again  your ACC is going to be going into hyperdrive. If you look down here  it's fine. If you look up here  then you get conflicting data. And then we have to flip the image for you to see that it's a set up. The impossible crate illusion. It's easy to fool the brain in  D. So you say   Aw  come on Shermer  anybody can do that in a Psych     text with an illusion like that.  Well here's the late  great Jerry Andrus'  impossible crate  illusion in  D  in which Jerry is standing inside the impossible crate. And he was kind enough to post this and give us the reveal. Of course  camera angle is everything. The photographer is over there  and this board appears to overlap with this one  and this one with that one  and so on. But even when I take it away  the illusion is so powerful because of how are brains are wired to find those certain kinds of patterns. This is a fairly new one that throws us off because of the conflicting patterns of comparing this angle with that angle. In fact  it's the exact same picture side by side. So what you're doing is comparing that angle instead of with this one  but with that one. And so your brain is fooled. Yet again  your pattern detection devices are fooled. Faces are easy to see because we have an additional evolved facial recognition software in our temporal lobes. Here's some faces on the side of a rock. I'm actually not even sure if this is    this might be Photoshopped. But anyway  the point is still made. Now which one of these looks odd to you  In a quick reaction  which one looks odd  The one on the left. Okay. So I'll rotate it so it'll be the one on the right. And you are correct. A fairly famous illusion    it was first done with Margaret Thatcher. Now  they trade up the politicians every time. Well  why is this happening  Well  we know exactly where it happens  in the temporal lobe  right across  sort of above your ear there  in a little structure called the fusiform gyrus. And there's two types of cells that do this  that record facial features either globally  or specifically these large  rapid firing cells  first look at the general face. So you recognize Obama immediately. And then you notice something quite a little bit odd about the eyes and the mouth. Especially when they're upside down  you're engaging that general facial recognition software there. Now I said back in our little thought experiment  you're a hominid walking on the plains of Africa. Is it just the wind or a dangerous predator  What's the difference between those  Well  the wind is inanimate  the dangerous predator is an intentional agent. And I call this process agenticity. That is the tendency to infuse patterns with meaning  intention and agency  often invisible beings from the top down. This is an idea that we got from a fellow TEDster here  Dan Dennett  who talked about taking the intentional stance. So it's a type of that expanded to explain  I think  a lot of different things  souls  spirits  ghosts  gods  demons  angels  aliens  intelligent designers  government conspiracists and all manner of invisible agents with power and intention  are believed to haunt our world and control our lives. I think it's the basis of animism and polytheism and monotheism. It's the belief that aliens are somehow more advanced than us  more moral than us  and the narratives always are that they're coming here to save us and rescue us from on high. The intelligent designer's always portrayed as this super intelligent  moral being that comes down to design life. Even the idea that government can rescue us    that's no longer the wave of the future  but that is  I think  a type of agenticity  projecting somebody up there  big and powerful  will come rescue us. And this is also  I think  the basis of conspiracy theories. There's somebody hiding behind there pulling the strings  whether it's the Illuminati or the Bilderbergers. But this is a pattern detection problem  isn't it  Some patterns are real and some are not. Was JFK assassinated by a conspiracy or by a lone assassin  Well  if you go there    there's people there on any given day    like when I went there  here    showing me where the different shooters were. My favorite one was he was in the manhole. And he popped out at the last second  took that shot. But of course  Lincoln was assassinated by a conspiracy. So we can't just uniformly dismiss all patterns like that. Because  let's face it  some patterns are real. Some conspiracies really are true. Explains a lot  maybe. And      has a conspiracy theory. It is a conspiracy. We did a whole issue on it. Nineteen members of Al Queda plotting to fly planes into buildings constitutes a conspiracy. But that's not what the       truthers  think. They think it was an inside job by the Bush administration. Well  that's a whole other lecture. You know how we know that      was not orchestrated by the Bush administration  Because it worked. So we are natural born dualists. Our agenticity process comes from the fact that we can enjoy movies like these. Because we can imagine  in essence  continuing on. We know that if you stimulate the temporal lobe  you can produce a feeling of out of body experiences  near death experiences  which you can do by just touching an electrode to the temporal lobe there. Or you can do it through loss of consciousness  by accelerating in a centrifuge. You get a hypoxia  or a lower oxygen. And the brain then senses that there's an out of body experience. You can use    which I did  went out and did    Michael Persinger's God Helmet  that bombards your temporal lobes with electromagnetic waves. And you get a sense of out of body experience. So I'm going to end here with a short video clip that sort of brings all this together. It's just a minute and a half. It ties together all this into the power of expectation and the power of belief. Go ahead and roll it. Narrator  This is the venue they chose for their fake auditions for an advert for lip balm. Woman  We're hoping we can use part of this in a national commercial  right  And this is test on some lip balms that we have over here. And these are our models who are going to help us  Roger and Matt. And we have our own lip balm  and we have a leading brand. Would you have any problem kissing our models to test it  Girl  No. Woman  You wouldn't   Girl  No.  Woman  You'd think that was fine. Girl  That would be fine.  Woman  Okay.  So this is a blind test. I'm going to ask you to go ahead and put a blindfold on. Kay  now can you see anything   Girl  No.  Pull it so you can't even see down.  Girl  Okay.  Woman  It's completely blind now  right  Girl  Yes.  Woman  Okay.  Now  what I'm going to be looking for in this test is how it protects your lips  the texture  right  and maybe if you can discern any flavor or not. Girl  Okay.  Woman  Have you ever done a kissing test before   Girl  No. Woman  Take a step here. Okay  now I'm going to ask you to pucker up. Pucker up big and lean in just a little bit  okay  Woman  Okay. And  Jennifer  how did that feel  Jennifer  Good. Girl  Oh my God  Michael Shermer  Thank you very much. Thank you. Thanks. So  if you're in the audience today  or maybe you're watching this talk in some other time or place  you are a participant in the digital rights ecosystem. Whether you're an artist  a technologist  a lawyer or a fan  the handling of copyright directly impacts your life. Rights management is no longer simply a question of ownership  it's a complex web of relationships and a critical part of our cultural landscape. YouTube cares deeply about the rights of content owners  but in order to give them choices about what they can do with copies  mashups and more  we need to first identify when copyrighted material is uploaded to our site. Let's look at a specific video so you can see how it works. Two years ago  recording artist Chris Brown released the official video of his single  Forever.  A fan saw it on TV  recorded it with her camera phone  and uploaded it to YouTube. Because Sony Music had registered Chris Brown's video in our Content ID system  within seconds of attempting to upload the video  the copy was detected  giving Sony the choice of what to do next. But how do we know that the user's video was a copy  Well  it starts with content owners delivering assets into our database  along with a usage policy that tells us what to do when we find a match. We compare each upload against all of the reference files in our database. This heat map is going to show you how the brain of the system works. Here we can see the original reference file being compared to the user generated content. The system compares every moment of one to the other to see if there's a match. This means that we can identify a match even if the copy used is just a portion of the original file  plays it in slow motion and has degraded audio and video quality. And we do this every time that a video is uploaded to YouTube. And that's over    hours of video every minute. When we find a match  we apply the policy that the rights owner has set down. And the scale and the speed of this system is truly breathtaking. We're not just talking about a few videos  we're talking about over     years of video every day  between new uploads and the legacy scans we regularly do across all of the content on the site. When we compare those hundred years of video  we're comparing it against millions of reference files in our database. It would be like        people staring at        monitors each and every day  without so much as a coffee break. Now  what do we do when we find a match  Well  most rights owners  instead of blocking  will allow the copy to be published. And then they benefit through the exposure  advertising and linked sales. Remember Chris Brown's video  Forever   Well  it had its day in the sun and then it dropped off the charts  and that looked like the end of the story  but sometime last year  a young couple got married. This is their wedding video. You may have seen it. What's amazing about this is  if the processional of the wedding was this much fun  can you imagine how much fun the reception must have been  I mean  who are these people  I totally want to go to that wedding. So their little wedding video went on to get over    million views. And instead of Sony blocking  they allowed the upload to occur. And they put advertising against it and linked from it to iTunes. And the song     months old  went back to number four on the iTunes charts. So Sony is generating revenue from both of these. And Jill and Kevin  the happy couple  they came back from their honeymoon and found that their video had gone crazy viral. And they've ended up on a bunch of talk shows  and they've used it as an opportunity to make a difference. The video's inspired over        dollars in donations to end domestic violence. The  JK Wedding  Entrance  Dance  became so popular that NBC parodied it on the season finale of  The Office   which just goes to show  it's truly an ecosystem of culture. Because it's not just amateurs borrowing from big studios  but sometimes big studios borrowing back. By empowering choice  we can create a culture of opportunity. And all it took to change things around was to allow for choice through rights identification. So why has no one ever solved this problem before  It's because it's a big problem  and it's complicated and messy. It's not uncommon for a single video to have multiple rights owners. There's musical labels. There's multiple music publishers. And each of these can vary by country. There's lots of cases where we have more than one work mashed together. So we have to manage many claims to the same video. YouTube's Content ID system addresses all of these cases. But the system only works through the participation of rights owners. If you have content that others are uploading to YouTube  you should register in the Content ID system  and then you'll have the choice about how your content is used. And think carefully about the policies that you attach to that content. By simply blocking all reuse  you'll miss out on new art forms  new audiences  new distribution channels and new revenue streams. But it's not just about dollars and impressions. Just look at all the joy that was spread through progressive rights management and new technology. And I think we can all agree that joy is definitely an idea worth spreading. Thank you. Thank you so much. I'm going to try to take you on a journey of the underwater acoustic world of whales and dolphins. Since we are such a visual species  it's hard for us to really understand this  so I'll use a mixture of figures and sounds and hope this can communicate it. But let's also think  as a visual species  what it's like when we go snorkeling or diving and try to look underwater. We really can't see very far. Our vision  which works so well in air  all of a sudden is very restricted and claustrophobic. And what marine mammals have evolved over the last tens of millions of years is ways to depend on sound to both explore their world and also to stay in touch with one another. Dolphins and toothed whales use echolocation. They can produce loud clicks and listen for echoes from the sea floor in order to orient. They can listen for echoes from prey in order to decide where food is and to decide which one they want to eat. All marine mammals use sound for communication to stay in touch. So the large baleen whales will produce long  beautiful songs  which are used in reproductive advertisement for male and females  both to find one another and to select a mate. And mother and young and closely bonded animals use calls to stay in touch with one another  so sound is really critical for their lives. The first thing that got me interested in the sounds of these underwater animals  whose world was so foreign to me  was evidence from captive dolphins that captive dolphins could imitate human sounds. And I mentioned I'll use some visual representations of sounds. Here's the first example. This is a plot of frequency against time    sort of like musical notation  where the higher notes are up higher and the lower notes are lower  and time goes this way. This is a picture of a trainer's whistle  a whistle a trainer will blow to tell a dolphin it's done the right thing and can come get a fish. It sounds sort of like  tweeeeeet.  Like that. This is a calf in captivity making an imitation of that trainer's whistle. If you hummed this tune to your dog or cat and it hummed it back to you  you ought to be pretty surprised. Very few nonhuman mammals can imitate sounds. It's really important for our music and our language. So it's a puzzle  The few other mammal groups that do this  why do they do it  A lot of my career has been devoted to trying to understand how these animals use their learning  use the ability to change what you say based on what you hear in their own communication systems. So let's start with calls of a nonhuman primate. Many mammals have to produce contact calls when  say  a mother and calf are apart. This is an example of a call produced by squirrel monkeys when they're isolated from another one. And you can see  there's not much variability in these calls. By contrast  the signature whistle which dolphins use to stay in touch  each individual here has a radically different call. They can use this ability to learn calls in order to develop more complicated and more distinctive calls to identify individuals. How about the setting in which animals need to use this call  Well let's look at mothers and calves. In normal life for mother and calf dolphin  they'll often drift apart or swim apart if Mom is chasing a fish  and when they separate they have to get back together again. What this figure shows is the percentage of the separations in which dolphins whistle  against the maximum distance. So when dolphins are separating by less than    meters  less than half the time they need to use whistles. Most of the time they can just find each other just by swimming around. But all of the time when they separate by more than     meters  they need to use these individually distinctive whistles to come back together again. Most of these distinctive signature whistles are quite stereotyped and stable through the life of a dolphin. But there are some exceptions. When a male dolphin leaves Mom  it will often join up with another male and form an alliance  which may last for decades. As these two animals form a social bond  their distinctive whistles actually converge and become very similar. This plot shows two members of a pair. As you can see at the top here  they share an up sweep  like  woop  woop  woop.  They both have that kind of up sweep. Whereas these members of a pair go  wo ot  wo ot  wo ot.  And what's happened is they've used this learning process to develop a new sign that identifies this new social group. It's a very interesting way that they can form a new identifier for the new social group that they've had. Let's now take a step back and see what this message can tell us about protecting dolphins from human disturbance. Anybody looking at this picture will know this dolphin is surrounded  and clearly his behavior is being disrupted. This is a bad situation. But it turns out that when just a single boat is approaching a group of dolphins at a couple hundred meters away  the dolphins will start whistling  they'll change what they're doing  they'll have a more cohesive group  wait for the boat to go by  and then they'll get back to normal business. Well  in a place like Sarasota  Florida  the average interval between times that a boat is passing within a hundred meters of a dolphin group is six minutes. So even in the situation that doesn't look as bad as this  it's still affecting the amount of time these animals have to do their normal work. And if we look at a very pristine environment like western Australia  Lars Bider has done work comparing dolphin behavior and distribution before there were dolphin watching boats. When there was one boat  not much of an impact. And two boats  When the second boat was added  what happened was that some of the dolphins left the area completely. Of the ones that stayed  their reproductive rate declined. So it could have a negative impact on the whole population. When we think of marine protected areas for animals like dolphins  this means that we have to be quite conscious about activities that we thought were benign. We may need to regulate the intensity of recreational boating and actual whale watching in order to prevent these kinds of problems. I'd also like to point out that sound doesn't obey boundaries. So you can draw a line to try to protect an area  but chemical pollution and noise pollution will continue to move through the area. And I'd like to switch now from this local  familiar  coastal environment to a much broader world of the baleen whales and the open ocean. This is a kind of map we've all been looking at. The world is mostly blue. But I'd also like to point out that the oceans are much more connected than we think. Notice how few barriers there are to movement across all of the oceans compared to land. To me  the most mind bending example of the interconnectedness of the ocean comes from an acoustic experiment where oceanographers took a ship to the southern Indian Ocean  deployed an underwater loudspeaker and played back a sound. That same sound traveled to the west  and could be heard in Bermuda  and traveled to the east  and could be heard in Monterey    the same sound. So we live in a world of satellite communication  are used to global communication  but it's still amazing to me. The ocean has properties that allow low frequency sound to basically move globally. The acoustic transit time for each of these paths is about three hours. It's nearly halfway around the globe. In the early '  s  Roger Payne and an ocean acoustician published a theoretical paper pointing out that it was possible that sound could transmit over these large areas  but very few biologists believed it. It actually turns out  though  even though we've only known of long range propagation for a few decades  the whales clearly have evolved  over tens of millions of years  a way to exploit this amazing property of the ocean. So blue whales and fin whales produce very low frequency sounds that can travel over very long ranges. The top plot here shows a complicated series of calls that are repeated by males. They form songs  and they appear to play a role in reproduction  sort of like that of song birds. Down below here  we see calls made by both males and females that also carry over very long ranges. The biologists continued to be skeptical of the long range communication issue well past the '  s  until the end of the Cold War. What happened was  during the Cold War  the U.S. Navy had a system that was secret at the time  that they used to track Russian submarines. It had deep underwater microphones  or hydrophones  cabled to shore  all wired back to a central place that could listen to sounds over the whole North Atlantic. And after the Berlin Wall fell  the Navy made these systems available to whale bio acousticians to see what they could hear. This is a plot from Christopher Clark who tracked one individual blue whale as it passed by Bermuda  went down to the latitude of Miami and came back again. It was tracked for    days  swimming       kilometers  or more than       miles. This shows us both that the calls are detectable over hundreds of miles and that whales routinely swim hundreds of miles. They're ocean based and scale animals who are communicating over much longer ranges than we had anticipated. Unlike fins and blues  which disperse into the temperate and tropical oceans  the humpbacked whales congregate in local traditional breeding grounds  so they can make a sound that's a little higher in frequency  broader band and more complicated. So you're listening to the complicated song produced by humpbacks here. Humpbacks  when they develop the ability to sing this song  they're listening to other whales and modifying what they sing based on what they're hearing  just like song birds or the dolphin whistles I described. This means that humpback song is a form of animal culture  just like music for humans would be. I think one of the most interesting examples of this comes from Australia. Biologists on the east coast of Australia were recording the songs of humpbacks in that area. And this orange line here marks the typical songs of east coast humpbacks. In '   they all sang the normal song. But in '   they heard a few weird songs  and it turned out that these strange songs were typical of west coast whales. The west coast calls became more and more popular  until by       none of the whales sang the east coast song  it was completely gone. They just sang the cool new west coast song. It's as if some new hit style had completely wiped out the old fashioned style before  and with no golden oldies stations. Nobody sang the old ones. I'd like to briefly just show what the ocean does to these calls. Now you are listening to a recording made by Chris Clark   .  miles away from a humpback. You can hear the full frequency range. It's quite loud. You sound very nearby. The next recording you're going to hear was made of the same humpback song    miles away. That's shown down here. You only hear the low frequencies. You hear the reverberation as the sound travels over long range in the ocean and is not quite as loud. Now after I play back these humpback calls  I'll play blue whale calls  but they have to be sped up because they're so low in frequency that you wouldn't be able to hear it otherwise. Here's a blue whale call at    miles  which was distant for the humpback. It's loud  clear    you can hear it very clearly. Here's the same call recorded from a hydrophone     miles away. There's a lot of noise  which is mostly other whales. But you can still hear that faint call. Let's now switch and think about a potential for human impacts. The most dominant sound that humans put into the ocean comes from shipping. This is the sound of a ship  and I'm having to talk a little louder to talk over it. Imagine that whale listening from     miles. There's a potential problem that maybe this kind of shipping noise would prevent whales from being able to hear each other. Now this is something that's been known for quite a while. This is a figure from a textbook on underwater sound. And on the y axis is the loudness of average ambient noise in the deep ocean by frequency. In the low frequencies  this line indicates sound that comes from seismic activity of the earth. Up high  these variable lines indicate increasing noise in this frequency range from higher wind and wave. But right in the middle here where there's a sweet spot  the noise is dominated by human ships. Now think about it. This is an amazing thing  That in this frequency range where whales communicate  the main source globally  on our planet  for the noise comes from human ships  thousands of human ships  distant  far away  just all aggregating. The next slide will show what the impact this may have on the range at which whales can communicate. So here we have the loudness of a call at the whale. And as we get farther away  the sound gets fainter and fainter. Now in the pre industrial ocean  as we were mentioning  this whale call could be easily detected. It's louder than noise at a range of a thousand kilometers. Let's now take that additional increase in noise that we saw comes from shipping. All of a sudden  the effective range of communication goes from a thousand kilometers to    kilometers. Now if this signal is used for males and females to find each other for mating and they're dispersed  imagine the impact this could have on the recovery of endangered populations. Whales also have contact calls like I described for the dolphins. I'll play the sound of a contact call used by right whales to stay in touch. And this is the kind of call that is used by  say  right whale mothers and calves as they separate to come back again. Now imagine    let's put the ship noise in the picture. What's a mother to do if the ship comes by and her calf isn't there  I'll describe a couple strategies. One strategy is if your call's down here  and the noise is in this band  you could shift the frequency of your call out of the noise band and communicate better. Susan Parks of Penn State has actually studied this. She's looked in the Atlantic. Here's data from the South Atlantic. Here's a typical South Atlantic contact call from the '  s. Look what happened by      to the average call. Same thing in the North Atlantic  in the '  s versus     . Over the last    years  as we've put more noise into the oceans  these whales have had to shift. It's as if the whole population had to shift from being basses to singing as a tenor. It's an amazing shift  induced by humans over this large scale  in both time and space. And we now know that whales can compensate for noise by calling louder  like I did when that ship was playing  by waiting for silence and by shifting their call out of the noise band. Now there's probably costs to calling louder or shifting the frequency away from where you want to be  and there's probably lost opportunities. If we also have to wait for silence  they may miss a critical opportunity to communicate. So we have to be very concerned about when the noise in habitats degrades the habitat enough that the animals either have to pay too much to be able to communicate  or are not able to perform critical functions. It's a really important problem. And I'm happy to say that there are several very promising developments in this area  looking at the impact of shipping on whales. In terms of the shipping noise  the International Maritime Organization of the United Nations has formed a group whose job is to establish guidelines for quieting ships  to tell the industry how you could quiet ships. And they've already found that by being more intelligent about better propeller design  you can reduce that noise by    percent. If you actually insulate and isolate the machinery of the ship from the hull  you can reduce that noise by    percent. So at this point  it's primarily an issue of cost and standards. If this group can establish standards  and if the shipbuilding industry adopts them for building new ships  we can now see a gradual decline in this potential problem. But there's also another problem from ships that I'm illustrating here  and that's the problem of collision. This is a whale that just squeaked by a rapidly moving container ship and avoided collision. But collision is a serious problem. Endangered whales are killed every year by ship collision  and it's very important to try to reduce this. I'll discuss two very promising approaches. The first case comes from the Bay of Fundy. These black lines mark shipping lanes in and out of the Bay of Fundy. The colorized area shows the risk of collision for endangered right whales because of the ships moving in this lane. It turns out that this lane here goes right through a major feeding area of right whales in the summer time  and it makes an area of a significant risk of collision. Well  biologists who couldn't take no for an answer went to the International Maritime Organization and petitioned them to say   Can't you move that lane  Those are just lines on the ground. Can't you move them over to a place where there's less of a risk   And the International Maritime Organization responded very strongly   These are the new lanes.  The shipping lanes have been moved. And as you can see  the risk of collision is much lower. So it's very promising  actually. We can be very creative about thinking of different ways to reduce these risks. Another action which was just taken independently by a shipping company itself was initiated because of concerns the shipping company had about greenhouse gas emissions with global warming. The Maersk Line looked at their competition and saw that everybody who is in shipping thinks time is money. They rush as fast as they can to get to their port. But then they often wait there. What Maersk did is they worked ways to slow down. They could slow down by about    percent. This reduced their fuel consumption by about    percent  which saved them money  and at the same time  it had a significant benefit for whales. It you slow down  you reduce the amount of noise you make and you reduce the risk of collision. So to conclude  I'd just like to point out  you know  the whales live in an amazing acoustic environment. They've evolved over tens of millions of years to take advantage of this. And we need to be very attentive and vigilant to thinking about where things that we do may unintentionally prevent them from being able to achieve their important activities. At the same time  we need to be really creative in thinking of solutions to be able to help reduce these problems. I hope these examples have shown some of the different directions we can take in addition to protected areas to be able to keep the ocean safe for whales to be able to continue to communicate. Thank you very much. I would be willing to bet that I'm the dumbest guy in the room because I couldn't get through school. I struggled with school. But what I knew at a very early age was that I loved money and I loved business and I loved this entrepreneurial thing  and I was raised to be an entrepreneur  and what I've been really passionate about ever since    and I've never spoken about this ever  until now    so this is the first time anyone's ever heard it  except my wife three days ago  because she said   What are you talking about   and I told her    is that I think we miss an opportunity to find these kids who have the entrepreneurial traits  and to groom them or show them that being an entrepreneur is actually a cool thing. It's not something that is a bad thing and is vilified  which is what happens in a lot of society. Kids  when we grow up  have dreams  and we have passions  and we have visions  and somehow we get those things crushed. We get told that we need to study harder or be more focused or get a tutor. My parents got me a tutor in French  and I still suck in French. Two years ago  I was the highest rated lecturer at MIT's entrepreneurial master's program. And it was a speaking event in front of groups of entrepreneurs from around the world. When I was in grade two  I won a city wide speaking competition  but nobody had ever said   Hey  this kid's a good speaker. He can't focus  but he loves walking around and getting people energized.  No one said   Get him a coach in speaking.  They said  get me a tutor in what I suck at. So as kids show these traits    and we need to start looking for them    I think we should be raising kids to be entrepreneurs instead of lawyers. Unfortunately the school system is grooming this world to say   Hey  let's be a lawyer or let's be a doctor   and we're missing that opportunity because no one ever says   Hey  be an entrepreneur.  Entrepreneurs are people    because we have a lot of them in this room    who have these ideas and these passions or see these needs in the world and we decide to stand up and do it. And we put everything on the line to make that stuff happen. We have the ability to get those groups of people around us that want to kind of build that dream with us  and I think if we could get kids to embrace the idea at a young age of being entrepreneurial  we could change everything in the world that is a problem today. Every problem that's out there  somebody has the idea for. And as a young kid  nobody can say it can't happen because you're too dumb to realize that you couldn't figure it out. I think we have an obligation as parents and a society to start teaching our kids to fish instead of giving them the fish    the old parable   If you give a man a fish  you feed him for a day. If you teach a man to fish  you feed him for a lifetime.  If we can teach our kids to become entrepreneurial    the ones that show those traits to be    like we teach the ones who have science gifts to go on in science  what if we saw the ones who had entrepreneurial traits and taught them to be entrepreneurs  We could actually have all these kids spreading businesses instead of waiting for government handouts. What we do is we sit and teach our kids all the things they shouldn't do  Don't hit  don't bite  don't swear. Right now we teach our kids to go after really good jobs  you know  and the school system teaches them to go after things like being a doctor and being a lawyer and being an accountant and a dentist and a teacher and a pilot. And the media says that it's really cool if we could go out and be a model or a singer or a sports hero like Luongo  Crosby. Our MBA programs do not teach kids to be entrepreneurs. The reason that I avoided an MBA program    other than the fact that I couldn't get into any because I had a    percent average out of high school and then    percent average at the only school in Canada that accepted me  Carlton    but our MBA programs don't teach kids to be entrepreneurs. They teach them to go work in corporations. So who's starting these companies  It's these random few people. Even in popular literature  the only book I've ever found    and this should be on all of your reading lists    the only book I've ever found that makes the entrepreneur into the hero is  Atlas Shrugged.  Everything else in the world tends to look at entrepreneurs and say that we're bad people. I look at even my family. Both my grandfathers were entrepreneurs. My dad was an entrepreneur. Both my brother and sister and I  all three of us own companies as well. And we all decided to start these things because it's really the only place we fit. We didn't fit in the normal work. We couldn't work for somebody else because we're too stubborn and we have all these other traits. But kids could be entrepreneurs as well. I'm a big part of a couple organizations globally called the Entrepreneurs' Organization and the Young Presidents' Organization. I just came back from speaking in Barcelona at the YPO global conference  and everyone that I met over there who's an entrepreneur struggled with school. I have    out of the    signs of attention deficit disorder diagnosed. So this thing right here is freaking me out. It's probably why I'm a little bit panicked right now    other than all the caffeine that I've had and the sugar    but this is really creepy for an entrepreneur. Attention deficit disorder  bipolar disorder. Do you know that bipolar disorder is nicknamed the CEO disease  Ted Turner's got it. Steve Jobs has it. All three of the founders of Netscape had it. I could go on and on. Kids    you can see these signs in kids. And what we're doing is we're giving them Ritalin and saying   Don't be an entrepreneurial type. Fit into this other system and try to become a student.  Sorry  entrepreneurs aren't students. We fast track. We figure out the game. I stole essays. I cheated on exams. I hired kids to do my accounting assignments in university for    consecutive assignments. But as an entrepreneur you don't do accounting  you hire accountants. So I just figured that out earlier. At least I can admit I cheated in university  most of you won't. I'm also quoted    and I told the person who wrote the textbook    I'm now quoted in that exact same university textbook in every Canadian university and college studies. In managerial accounting  I'm chapter eight. I open up chapter eight talking about budgeting. And I told the author  after they did my interview  that I cheated in that same course. And she thought it was too funny to not include it anyway. But kids  you can see these signs in them. The definition of an entrepreneur is  a person who organizes  operates and assumes the risk of a business venture.  That doesn't mean you have to go to an MBA program. It doesn't mean you have to get through school. It just means that those few things have to feel right in your gut. And we've heard those things about  is it nurture or is it nature   right  Is it thing one or thing two  What is it  Well  I don't think it's either. I think it can be both. I was groomed as an entrepreneur. When I was growing up as a young kid  I had no choice  because I was taught at a very early  young age    when my dad realized I wasn't going to fit into everything else that was being taught to me in school    that he could teach me to figure out business at an early age. He groomed us  the three of us  to hate the thought of having a job and to love the fact of creating companies that we could employ other people. My first little business venture  I was seven years old  I was in Winnipeg  and I was lying in my bedroom with one of those long extension cords. And I was calling all the dry cleaners in Winnipeg to find out how much would the dry cleaners pay me for coat hangers. And my mom came into the room and she said   Where are you going to get the coat hangers to sell to the dry cleaners   And I said   Let's go and look in the basement.  And we went down to the basement. And I opened up this cupboard. And there was about a thousand coat hangers that I'd collected. Because  when I told her I was going out to play with the kids  I was going door to door in the neighborhood to collect coat hangers to put in the basement to sell. Because I saw her a few weeks before that    you could get paid. They used to pay you two cents per coat hanger. So I was just like  well there's all kinds of coat hangers. And so I'll just go get them. And I knew she wouldn't want me to go get them  so I just did it anyway. And I learned that you could actually negotiate with people. This one person offered me three cents and I got him up to three and a half. I even knew at a seven year old age that I could actually get a fractional percent of a cent  and people would pay that because it multiplied up. At seven years old I figured it out. I got three and a half cents for a thousand coat hangers. I sold license plate protectors door to door. My dad actually made me go find someone who would sell me these things at wholesale. And at nine years old  I walked around in the city of Sudbury selling license plate protectors door to door to houses. And I remember this one customer so vividly because I also did some other stuff with these clients. I sold newspapers. And he wouldn't buy a newspaper from me ever. But I was convinced I was going to get him to buy a license plate protector. And he's like   Well  we don't need one.  And I said   But you've got two cars ...     I'm nine years old. I'm like   But you have two cars and they don't have license plate protectors.  And he said   I know.  And I said   This car here's got one license plate that's all crumpled up.  And he said   Yes  that's my wife's car.  And I said   Why don't we just test one on the front of your wife's car and see if it lasts longer.  So I knew there were two cars with two license plates on each. If I couldn't sell all four  I could at least get one. I learned that at a young age. I did comic book arbitrage. When I was about    years old  I sold comic books out of our cottage on Georgian Bay. And I would go biking up to the end of the beach and buy all the comics from the poor kids. And then I would go back to the other end of the beach and sell them to the rich kids. But it was obvious to me  right  Buy low  sell high. You've got this demand over here that has money. Don't try to sell to the poor kids  they don't have cash. The rich people do. Go get some. So that's obvious  right. It's like a recession. So  there's a recession. There's still    trillion dollars circulating in the U.S. economy. Go get some of that. And I learned that at a young age. I also learned  don't reveal your source  because I got beat up after about four weeks of doing this because one of the rich kids found out where I was buying my comics from  and he didn't like the fact that he was paying a lot more. I was forced to get a paper route at    years old. I didn't really want a paper route  but at     my dad said   That's going to be your next business.  So not only would he get me one  but I had to get two  and then he wanted me to hire someone to deliver half the papers  which I did  and then I realized that collecting tips was where you made all the money. So I would collect the tips and get payment. So I would go and collect for all the papers. He could just deliver them. Because then I realized I could make the money. By this point  I was definitely not going to be an employee. My dad owned an automotive and industrial repair shop. He had all these old automotive parts lying around. They had this old brass and copper. I asked him what he did with it  and he said he just throws it out. I said   But wouldn't somebody pay you for that   And he goes   Maybe.  Remember at    years old    so    years ago I saw opportunity in this stuff. I saw there was money in garbage. And I was actually collecting it from all the automotive shops in the area on my bicycle. And then my dad would drive me on Saturdays to a scrap metal recycler where I got paid. And I thought that was kind of cool. Strangely enough     years later  we're building       GOT JUNK  and making money off that too. I built these little pincushions when I was    years old in Cubs  and we made these pin cushions for our moms for Mother's Day. And you made these pincushions out of wooden clothespins    when we used to hang clothes on clotheslines outside. And you'd make these chairs. And I had these little pillows that I would sew up. And you could stuff pins in them. Because people used to sew and they needed a pin cushion. But what I realized was that you had to have options. So I actually spray painted a whole bunch of them brown. And then when I went to the door  it wasn't   Do you want to buy one   It was   Which color would you like   Like I'm    years old  you're not going to say no to me  especially if you have two options    you have the brown one or the clear one. So I learned that lesson at a young age. I learned that manual labor really sucks. Right  like cutting lawns is brutal. But because I had to cut lawns all summer for all of our neighbors and get paid to do that  I realized that recurring revenue from one client is amazing. That if I land this client once  and every week I get paid by that person  that's way better than trying to sell one clothespin thing to one person. Because you can't sell them more. So I love that recurring revenue model I started to learn at a young age. Remember  I was being groomed to do this. I was not allowed to have jobs. I would caddy  I would go to the golf course and caddy for people. But I realized that there was this one hill on our golf course  the   th hole that had this huge hill. And people could never get their bags up it. So I would sit there with a lawn chair and just carry up all the people who didn't have caddies. I would carry their golf bags up to the top  and they'd pay me a dollar. Meanwhile  my friends were working for five hours to haul some guy's bag around and get paid    bucks. I'm like   That's stupid because you have to work for five hours. That doesn't make any sense.  You just figure out a way to make more money faster. Every week  I would go to the corner store and buy all these pops. Then I would go up and deliver them to these    year old women playing bridge. And they'd give me their orders for the following week. And then I'd just deliver pop and I'd just charge twice. And I had this captured market. You didn't need contracts. You just needed to have a supply and demand and this audience who bought into you. These women weren't going to go to anybody else because they liked me  and I kind of figured it out. I went and got golf balls from golf courses. But everybody else was looking in the bush and looking in the ditches for golf balls. I'm like  screw that. They're all in the pond and nobody's going into the pond. So I would go into the ponds and crawl around and pick them up with my toes. You just pick them up with both feet. You can't do it on stage. You get the golf balls  and you just throw them in your bathing suit trunks and when you're done you've got a couple hundred of them. But the problem is that people all didn't want all the golf balls. So I just packaged them. I'm like     right  I packaged them up three ways. I had the Pinnacles and DDHs and the really cool ones back then. Those sold for two dollars each. And then I had all the good ones that didn't look crappy. They were    cents each. And then I'd sell    at a time of all the crappy ones. And they could use those for practice balls. I sold sunglasses  when I was in school  to all the kids in high school. This is what really kind of gets everybody hating you is because you're trying to extract money from all your friends all the time. But it paid the bills. So I sold lots and lots of sunglasses. Then when the school shut me down    the school actually called me into the office and told me I couldn't do it    so I went to the gas stations and I sold lots of them to the gas stations and had the gas stations sell them to their customers. That was cool because then I had retail outlets. And I think I was   . Then I paid my entire way through first year university at Carlton by selling wine skins door to door. You know that you can hold a    ounce bottle of rum and two bottles of coke in a wineskin  So what  right  Yeah  but you know what  You stuff that down your shorts  when you go into a football game you can get booze in for free  everybody bought them. Supply  demand  big opportunity. I also branded it  so I sold them for five times the normal cost. It had our university logo on it. You know we teach our kids and we buy them games  but why don't we get them games  if they're entrepreneurial kids  that kind of nurture the traits that you need to be entrepreneurs  Why don't you teach them not to waste money  I remember being told to walk out in the middle of a street in Banff  Alberta because I'd thrown a penny out in the street  and my dad said   Go pick it up.  He said   I work too damn hard for my money. I'm not going to see you ever waste a penny.  And I remember that lesson to this day. Allowances teach kids the wrong habits. Allowances  by nature  are teaching kids to think about a job. An entrepreneur doesn't expect a regular paycheck. Allowance is breeding kids at a young age to expect a regular paycheck. That's wrong  for me  if you want to raise entrepreneurs. What I do with my kids now    I've got two  nine and seven    is I teach them to walk around the house and the yard  looking for stuff that needs to get done. Come to me and tell me what it is. Or I'll come to them and say   Here's what I need done.  And then you know what we do  We negotiate. They go around looking for what it is. But then we negotiate on what they're going to get paid. And then they don't have a regular check  but they have more opportunities to find more stuff  and they learn the skill of negotiating  and they learn the skill of finding opportunities as well. You breed that kind of stuff. Each of my kids has two piggy banks. Fifty percent of all the money that they earn or get gifted     percent goes in their house account     percent goes in their toy account. Anything in their toy account they can spend on whatever they want. The    percent that goes in their house account  every six months  goes to the bank. They walk up with me. Every year all the money in the bank goes to their broker. Both my nine  and seven year olds have a stock broker already. But I'm teaching them to force that savings habit. It drives me crazy that    year olds are saying   Maybe I'll start contributing to my RSP now.  Shit  you've missed    years. You can teach those habits to young kids when they don't even feel the pain yet. Don't read them bedtime stories every night. Maybe four nights out of the week read them bedtime stories and three nights of the week have them tell stories. Why don't you sit down with kids and give them four items  a red shirt  a blue tie  a kangaroo and a laptop  and have them tell a story about those four things  My kids do that all the time. It teaches them to sell  it teaches them creativity  it teaches them to think on their feet. Just do that kind of stuff and have fun with it. Get kids to stand up in front of groups and talk  even if it's just stand up in front of their friends and do plays and have speeches. Those are entrepreneurial traits that you want to be nurturing. Show the kids what bad customers or bad employees look like. Show them the grumpy employees. When you see grumpy customer service  point that out to them. Say   By the way  that guy's a crappy employee.  And say   These ones are good ones.  If you go into a restaurant and you have bad customer service  show them what bad customer service looks like. We have all these lessons in front of us  but we don't take those opportunities  we teach kids to go get a tutor. Imagine if you actually took all the kids' junk that's in the house right now  all the toys that they've outgrown two years ago and said   Why don't we start selling some of this on Craigslist and Kijiji   And they can actually sell it and learn how to find scammers when they get email offers come in. They can come into your account or a sub account or whatever. But teach them how to fix the price  guess the price  pull up the photos. Teach them how to do that kind of stuff and make money. Then the money they get     percent goes in their house account     percent goes in their toy account. My kids love this stuff. Some of the entrepreneurial traits that you've got to nurture in kids  attainment  tenacity  leadership  introspection  interdependence  values. All these traits you can find in young kids  and you can help nurture them. Look for that kind of stuff. There's two traits that I want you to also look out for that we don't kind of get out of their system. Don't medicate kids for attention deficit disorder unless it is really  really freaking bad. The same with the whole things on mania and stress and depression  unless it is so clinically brutal  man. Bipolar disorder is nicknamed the CEO disease. When Steve Jurvetson and Jim Clark and Jim Barksdale have all got it  and they built Netscape    imagine if they were given Ritalin. We wouldn't have have that stuff  right  Al Gore really would have had to invented the Internet. These skills are the skills we should be teaching in the classroom as well as everything else. I'm not saying don't get kids to want to be lawyers. But how about getting entrepreneurship to be ranked right up there with the rest of them as well  Because there's huge opportunities in that. I want to close with a quick little video. It's a video that was done by one of the companies that I mentor. These guys  Grasshopper. It's about kids. It's about entrepreneurship. Hopefully this inspires you to take what you've heard from me and do something with it to change the world.  Kid ...  And you thought you could do anything     You still can.   Because a lot of what we consider impossible ...   ... is easy to overcome   Because in case you haven't noticed  we live in a place where   One individual can make a difference   Want proof    Just look at the people who built our country    Our parents  grandparents  our aunts  uncles ...   They were immigrants  newcomers ready to make their mark   Maybe they came with very little   Or perhaps they didn't own anything except for ...   ... a single brilliant idea   These people were thinkers  doers ...   ... innovators ...   ... until they came up with the name ...   ... entrepreneurs    They change the way we think about what is possible.   They have a clear vision of how life can be better   for all of us  even when times are tough.   Right now  it's hard to see ...   ... when our view is cluttered with obstacles.   But turbulence creates opportunities   for success  achievement  and pushes us ...   to discover new ways of doing things   So what opportunities will you go after and why    If you're an entrepreneur   you know that risk isn't the reward.   No. The rewards are driving innovation ...   ... changing people's lives. Creating jobs.   Fueling growth.   And making a better world.   Entrepreneurs are everywhere.   They run small businesses that support our economy    design tools to help you ...   ... stay connected with friends  family and colleagues around the world.   And they're finding new ways of helping to solve society's oldest problems.   Do you know an entrepreneur    Entrepreneurs can be anyone ...   Even ... you    So seize the opportunity to create the job you always wanted   Help heal the economy   Make a difference.   Take your business to new heights.   But most importantly    remember when you were a kid ...   when everything was within you reach    and then say to yourself quietly  but with determination     It still is.   Thank you very much for having me.  Sanskrit  This is an ode to the mother goddess  that most of us in India learn when we are children. I learned it when I was four at my mother's knee. That year she introduced me to dance  and thus began my tryst with classical dance. Since then    it's been four decades now    I've trained with the best in the field  performed across the globe  taught young and old alike  created  collaborated  choreographed  and wove a rich tapestry of artistry  achievement and awards. The crowning glory was in       when I received this country's fourth highest civilian award  the Padma Shri  for my contribution to art. But nothing  nothing prepared me for what I was to hear on the first of July     . I heard the word  carcinoma.  Yes  breast cancer. As I sat dumbstruck in my doctor's office  I heard other words   cancer    stage    grade.  Until then  Cancer was the zodiac sign of my friend  stage was what I performed on  and grades were what I got in school. That day  I realized I had an unwelcome  uninvited  new life partner. As a dancer  I know the nine rasas or the navarasas  anger  valor  disgust  humor and fear. I thought I knew what fear was. That day  I learned what fear was. Overcome with the enormity of it all and the complete feeling of loss of control  I shed copious tears and asked my dear husband  Jayant. I said   Is this it  Is this the end of the road  Is this the end of my dance   And he  the positive soul that he is  said   No  this is just a hiatus  a hiatus during the treatment  and you'll get back to doing what you do best.  I realized then that I  who thought I had complete control of my life  had control of only three things  My thought  my mind    the images that these thoughts created    and the action that derived from it. So here I was wallowing in a vortex of emotions and depression and what have you  with the enormity of the situation  wanting to go to a place of healing  health and happiness. I wanted to go from where I was to where I wanted to be  for which I needed something. I needed something that would pull me out of all this. So I dried my tears  and I declared to the world at large ... I said   Cancer's only one page in my life  and I will not allow this page to impact the rest of my life.  I also declared to the world at large that I would ride it out  and I would not allow cancer to ride me. But to go from where I was to where I wanted to be  I needed something. I needed an anchor  an image  a peg to peg this process on  so that I could go from there. And I found that in my dance  my dance  my strength  my energy  my passion  my very life breath. But it wasn't easy. Believe me  it definitely wasn't easy. How do you keep cheer when you go from beautiful to bald in three days  How do you not despair when  with the body ravaged by chemotherapy  climbing a mere flight of stairs was sheer torture  that to someone like me who could dance for three hours  How do you not get overwhelmed by the despair and the misery of it all  All I wanted to do was curl up and weep. But I kept telling myself fear and tears are options I did not have. So I would drag myself into my dance studio    body  mind and spirit    every day into my dance studio  and learn everything I learned when I was four  all over again  reworked  relearned  regrouped. It was excruciatingly painful  but I did it. Difficult. I focused on my mudras  on the imagery of my dance  on the poetry and the metaphor and the philosophy of the dance itself. And slowly  I moved out of that miserable state of mind. But I needed something else. I needed something to go that extra mile  and I found it in that metaphor which I had learned from my mother when I was four. The metaphor of Mahishasura Mardhini  of Durga. Durga  the mother goddess  the fearless one  created by the pantheon of Hindu gods. Durga  resplendent  bedecked  beautiful  her    arms ready for warfare  as she rode astride her lion into the battlefield to destroy Mahishasur. Durga  the epitome of creative feminine energy  or shakti. Durga  the fearless one. I made that image of Durga and her every attribute  her every nuance  my very own. Powered by the symbology of a myth and the passion of my training  I brought laser sharp focus into my dance  laser sharp focus to such an extent that I danced a few weeks after surgery. I danced through chemo and radiation cycles  much to the dismay of my oncologist. I danced between chemo and radiation cycles and badgered him to fit it to my performing dance schedule. What I had done is I had tuned out of cancer and tuned into my dance. Yes  cancer has just been one page in my life. My story is a story of overcoming setbacks  obstacles and challenges that life throws at you. My story is the power of thought. My story is the power of choice. It's the power of focus. It's the power of bringing ourselves to the attention of something that so animates you  so moves you  that something even like cancer becomes insignificant. My story is the power of a metaphor. It's the power of an image. Mine was that of Durga  Durga the fearless one. She was also called Simhanandini  the one who rode the lion. As I ride out  as I ride my own inner strength  my own inner resilience  armed as I am with what medication can provide and continue treatment  as I ride out into the battlefield of cancer  asking my rogue cells to behave  I want to be known not as a cancer survivor  but as a cancer conqueror. I present to you an excerpt of that work  Simhanandini.  I'm going to talk about the simple truth in leadership in the   st century. In the   st century  we need to actually look at    and what I'm actually going to encourage you to consider today    is to go back to our school days when we learned how to count. But I think it's time for us to think about what we count. Because what we actually count truly counts. Let me start by telling you a little story. This is Van Quach. She came to this country in      from Vietnam. She changed her name to Vivian because she wanted to fit in here in America. Her first job was at an inner city motel in San Francisco as a maid. I happened to buy that motel about three months after Vivian started working there. So Vivian and I have been working together for    years. With the youthful idealism of a    year old  in       I started my company and I called it Joie de Vivre  a very impractical name  because I actually was looking to create joy of life. And this first hotel that I bought  motel  was a pay by the hour  no tell motel in the inner city of San Francisco. As I spent time with Vivian  I saw that she had sort of a joie de vivre in how she did her work. It made me question and curious  How could someone actually find joy in cleaning toilets for a living  So I spent time with Vivian  and I saw that she didn't find joy in cleaning toilets. Her job  her goal and her calling was not to become the world's greatest toilet scrubber. What counts for Vivian was the emotional connection she created with her fellow employees and our guests. And what gave her inspiration and meaning was the fact that she was taking care of people who were far away from home. Because Vivian knew what it was like to be far away from home. That very human lesson  more than    years ago  served me well during the last economic downturn we had. In the wake of the dotcom crash and       San Francisco Bay Area hotels went through the largest percentage revenue drop in the history of American hotels. We were the largest operator of hotels in the Bay Area  so we were particularly vulnerable. But also back then  remember we stopped eating French fries in this country. Well  not exactly  of course not. We started eating  freedom fries   and we started boycotting anything that was French. Well  my name of my company  Joie de Vivre    so I started getting these letters from places like Alabama and Orange County saying to me that they were going to boycott my company because they thought we were a French company. And I'd write them back  and I'd say   What a minute. We're not French. We're an American company. We're based in San Francisco.  And I'd get a terse response   Oh  that's worse.  So one particular day when I was feeling a little depressed and not a lot of joie de vivre  I ended up in the local bookstore around the corner from our offices. And I initially ended up in the business section of the bookstore looking for a business solution. But given my befuddled state of mind  I ended up in the self help section very quickly. That's where I got reacquainted with Abraham Maslow's  hierarchy of needs.  I took one psychology class in college  and I learned about this guy  Abraham Maslow  as many of us are familiar with his hierarchy of needs. But as I sat there for four hours  the full afternoon  reading Maslow  I recognized something that is true of most leaders. One of the simplest facts in business is something that we often neglect  and that is that we're all human. Each of us  no matter what our role is in business  has some hierarchy of needs in the workplace. So as I started reading more Maslow  what I started to realize is that Maslow  later in his life  wanted to take this hierarchy for the individual and apply it to the collective  to organizations and specifically to business. But unfortunately  he died prematurely in       and so he wasn't really able to live that dream completely. So I realized in that dotcom crash that my role in life was to channel Abe Maslow. And that's what I did a few years ago when I took that five level hierarchy of needs pyramid and turned it into what I call the transformation pyramid  which is survival  success and transformation. It's not just fundamental in business  it's fundamental in life. And we started asking ourselves the questions about how we were actually addressing the higher needs  these transformational needs for our key employees in the company. These three levels of the hierarchy needs relate to the five levels of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. But as we started asking ourselves about how we were addressing the higher needs of our employees and our customers  I realized we had no metrics. We had nothing that actually could tell us whether we were actually getting it right. So we started asking ourselves  What kind of less obvious metrics could we use to actually evaluate our employees' sense of meaning  or our customers' sense of emotional connection with us  For example  we actually started asking our employees  do they understand the mission of our company  and do they feel like they believe in it  can they actually influence it  and do they feel that their work actually has an impact on it  We started asking our customers  did they feel an emotional connection with us  in one of seven different kinds of ways. Miraculously  as we asked these questions and started giving attention higher up the pyramid  what we found is we created more loyalty. Our customer loyalty skyrocketed. Our employee turnover dropped to one third of the industry average  and during that five year dotcom bust  we tripled in size. As I went out and started spending time with other leaders out there and asking them how they were getting through that time  what they told me over and over again was that they just manage what they can measure. What we can measure is that tangible stuff at the bottom of the pyramid. They didn't even see the intangible stuff higher up the pyramid. So I started asking myself the question  How can we get leaders to start valuing the intangible  If we're taught as leaders to just manage what we can measure  and all we can measure is the tangible in life  we're missing a whole lot of things at the top of the pyramid. So I went out and studied a bunch of things  and I found a survey that showed that    percent of business leaders worldwide believe that the intangibles are important in their business  things like intellectual property  their corporate culture  their brand loyalty  and yet  only five percent of those same leaders actually had a means of measuring the intangibles in their business. So as leaders  we understand that intangibles are important  but we don't have a clue how to measure them. So here's another Einstein quote   Not everything that can be counted counts  and not everything that counts can be counted.  I hate to argue with Einstein  but if that which is most valuable in our life and our business actually can't be counted or valued  aren't we going to spend our lives just mired in measuring the mundane  It was that sort of heady question about what counts that led me to take my CEO hat off for a week and fly off to the Himalayan peaks. I flew off to a place that's been shrouded in mystery for centuries  a place some folks call Shangri La. It's actually moved from the survival base of the pyramid to becoming a transformational role model for the world. I went to Bhutan. The teenage king of Bhutan was also a curious man  but this was back in       when he ascended to the throne two days after his father passed away. At age     he started asking the kinds of questions that you'd expect of someone with a beginner's mind. On a trip through India  early in his reign as king  he was asked by an Indian journalist about the Bhutanese GDP  the size of the Bhutanese GDP. The king responded in a fashion that actually has transformed us four decades later. He said the following  he said   Why are we so obsessed and focused with gross domestic product  Why don't we care more about gross national happiness   Now  in essence  the king was asking us to consider an alternative definition of success  what has come to be known as GNH  or gross national happiness. Most world leaders didn't take notice  and those that did thought this was just  Buddhist economics.  But the king was serious. This was a notable moment  because this was the first time a world leader in almost     years had suggested that intangible of happiness    that leader     years ago  Thomas Jefferson with the Declaration of Independence        years later  this king was suggesting that intangible of happiness is something that we should measure  and it's something we should actually value as government officials. For the next three dozen years as king  this king actually started measuring and managing around happiness in Bhutan    including  just recently  taking his country from being an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy with no bloodshed  no coup. Bhutan  for those of you who don't know it  is the newest democracy in the world  just two years ago. So as I spent time with leaders in the GNH movement  I got to really understand what they're doing. And I got to spend some time with the prime minister. Over dinner  I asked him an impertinent question. I asked him   How can you create and measure something which evaporates    in other words  happiness   And he's a very wise man  and he said   Listen  Bhutan's goal is not to create happiness. We create the conditions for happiness to occur. In other words  we create a habitat of happiness.  Wow  that's interesting. He said that they have a science behind that art  and they've actually created four essential pillars  nine key indicators and    different metrics that help them to measure their GNH. One of those key indicators is  How do the Bhutanese feel about how they spend their time each day  It's a good question. How do you feel about how you spend your time each day  Time is one of the scarcest resources in the modern world. And yet  of course  that little intangible piece of data doesn't factor into our GDP calculations. As I spent my week up in the Himalayas  I started to imagine what I call an emotional equation. And it focuses on something I read long ago from a guy named Rabbi Hyman Schachtel. How many know him  Anybody        he wrote a book called  The Real Enjoyment of Living   and he suggested that happiness is not about having what you want  instead  it's about wanting what you have. Or in other words  I think the Bhutanese believe happiness equals wanting what you have    imagine gratitude    divided by having what you want    gratification. The Bhutanese aren't on some aspirational treadmill  constantly focused on what they don't have. Their religion  their isolation  their deep respect for their culture and now the principles of their GNH movement all have fostered a sense of gratitude about what they do have. How many of us here  as TEDsters in the audience  spend more of our time in the bottom half of this equation  in the denominator  We are a bottom heavy culture in more ways than one. The reality is  in Western countries  quite often we do focus on the pursuit of happiness as if happiness is something that we have to go out    an object that we're supposed to get  or maybe many objects. Actually  in fact  if you look in the dictionary  many dictionaries define pursuit as to  chase with hostility.  Do we pursue happiness with hostility  Good question. But back to Bhutan. Bhutan's bordered on its north and south by    percent of the world's population. Could this little country  like a startup in a mature industry  be the spark plug that influences a   st century of middle class in China and India  Bhutan's created the ultimate export  a new global currency of well being  and there are    countries around the world today that are studying their own GNH. You may have heard  this last fall Nicolas Sarkozy in France announcing the results of an    month study by two Nobel economists  focusing on happiness and wellness in France. Sarkozy suggested that world leaders should stop myopically focusing on GDP and consider a new index  what some French are calling a  joie de vivre index.  I like it. Co branding opportunities. Just three days ago  three days ago here at TED  we had a simulcast of David Cameron  potentially the next prime minister of the UK  quoting one of my favorite speeches of all time  Robert Kennedy's poetic speech from      when he suggested that we're myopically focused on the wrong thing and that GDP is a misplaced metric. So it suggests that the momentum is shifting. I've taken that Robert Kennedy quote  and I've turned it into a new balance sheet for just a moment here. This is a collection of things that Robert Kennedy said in that quote. GDP counts everything from air pollution to the destruction of our redwoods. But it doesn't count the health of our children or the integrity of our public officials. As you look at these two columns here  doesn't it make you feel like it's time for us to start figuring out a new way to count  a new way to imagine what's important to us in life  Certainly Robert Kennedy suggested at the end of the speech exactly that. He said GDP  measures everything in short  except that which makes life worthwhile.  Wow. So how do we do that  Let me say one thing we can just start doing ten years from now  at least in this country. Why in the heck in America are we doing a census in       We're spending    billion dollars on the census. We're asking    simple questions    it is simplicity. But all of those questions are tangible. They're about demographics. They're about where you live  how many people you live with  and whether you own your home or not. That's about it. We're not asking meaningful metrics. We're not asking important questions. We're not asking anything that's intangible. Abe Maslow said long ago something you've heard before  but you didn't realize it was him. He said   If the only tool you have is a hammer  everything starts to look like a nail.  We've been fooled by our tool. Excuse that expression. We've been fooled by our tool. GDP has been our hammer. And our nail has been a   th  and   th century industrial era model of success. And yet     percent of the world's GDP today is in that intangible industry we call service  the service industry  the industry I'm in. And only    percent is in the tangible industries of manufacturing and agriculture. So maybe it's time that we get a bigger toolbox  right  Maybe it's time we get a toolbox that doesn't just count what's easily counted  the tangible in life  but actually counts what we most value  the things that are intangible. I guess I'm sort of a curious CEO. I was also a curious economics major as an undergrad. I learned that economists measure everything in tangible units of production and consumption as if each of those tangible units is exactly the same. They aren't the same. In fact  as leaders  what we need to learn is that we can influence the quality of that unit of production by creating the conditions for our employees to live their calling. In Vivian's case  her unit of production isn't the tangible hours she works  it's the intangible difference she makes during that one hour of work. This is Dave Arringdale who's actually been a longtime guest at Vivian's motel. He stayed there a hundred times in the last    years  and he's loyal to the property because of the relationship that Vivian and her fellow employees have created with him. They've created a habitat of happiness for Dave. He tells me that he can always count on Vivian and the staff there to make him feel at home. Why is it that business leaders and investors quite often don't see the connection between creating the intangible of employee happiness with creating the tangible of financial profits in their business  We don't have to choose between inspired employees and sizable profits  we can have both. In fact  inspired employees quite often help make sizable profits  right  So what the world needs now  in my opinion  is business leaders and political leaders who know what to count. We count numbers. We count on people. What really counts is when we actually use our numbers to truly take into account our people. I learned that from a maid in a motel and a king of a country. What can you start counting today  What one thing can you start counting today that actually would be meaningful in your life  whether it's your work life or your business life  Thank you very much. I'm going to begin by reciting a poem.  Oh beloved dentist  Your rubber fingers in my mouth ... your voice so soft and muffled ... Lower the mask  dear dentist  lower the mask.  Okay  in this presentation  I'm going to be putting the right side of your brains through a fairly serious workout. You're going to see a lot of imagery  and it's not always connected to what I'm talking about  so I need you to kind of split your brains in half and let the images flow over one side and listen to me on the other. So I am one of those people with a transformative personal story. Six years ago  after    years in graphic design and typography  I changed the way I was working and the way most graphic designers work to pursue a more personal approach to my work  with only the humble attempt to simply make a living doing something that I loved. But something weird happened. I became bizarrely popular. My current work seems to resonate with people in a way that has so taken me by surprise that I still frequently wonder what in the hell is going on. And I'm slowly coming to understand that the appeal of what I do may be connected to why I do it. These days  I call myself a graphic artist. So where my work as a graphic designer was to follow strategy  my work now follows my heart and my interests with the guidance of my ego to create work that is mutually beneficial to myself and a client. Now  this is heresy in the design world. The ego is not supposed to be involved in graphic design. But I find that for myself  without exception  the more I deal with the work as something of my own  as something that is personal  the more successful it is as something that's compelling  interesting and sustaining. So I exist somewhat outside of the mainstream of design thinking. Where others might look at measurable results  I tend to be interested in more ethereal qualities  like  Does it bring joy    Is there a sense of wonder   and  Does it invoke curiosity   This is a scientific diagram  by the way. I don't have time to explain it  but it has to do with DNA and RNA. So I have a particular imaginative approach to visual work. The things that interest me when I'm working are visual structure  surprise and anything that requires figuring things out. So for this reason  I'm particularly drawn to systems and patterns. I'm going to give you a couple of examples of how my brain works. This is a piece that I did for The Guardian newspaper in the U.K. They have a magazine that they call G . And this is for their puzzle special in     . And puzzling it is. I started by creating a series of tiling units. And these tiling units  I designed specifically so that they would contain parts of letterforms within their shapes so that I could then join those pieces together to create letters and then words within the abstract patterning. But then as well  I was able to just flip them  rotate them and combine them in different ways to create either regular patterns or abstract patterns. So here's the word puzzle again. And here it is with the abstract surrounding. And as you can see  it's extremely difficult to read. But all I have to do is fill certain areas of those letterforms and I can bring those words out of the background pattern. But maybe that's a little too obvious. So then I can add some color in with the background and add a bit more color in with the words themselves  and this way  working with the art director  I'm able to bring it to just the right point that it's puzzling for the audience    they can figure out that there's something they have to read    but it's not impossible for them to read. I'm also interested in working with unusual materials and common materials in unusual ways. So this requires figuring out how to get the most out of something's innate properties and also how to bend it to my will. So ultimately  my goal is to create something unexpected. To this end  I have worked in sugar for Stefan Sagmeister  three time TED speaker. And this project began essentially on my kitchen table. I've been eating cereal for breakfast all of my life. And for that same amount of time  I've been spilling sugar on the table and just kind of playing with it with my fingers. And eventually I used this technique to create a piece of artwork. And then I used it again to create six pieces for Stefan's book   Things in My Life I've Learned So Far.  And these were created without sketches  just freehand  by putting the sugar down on a white surface and then manipulating it to get the words and designs out of it. Recently  I've also made some rather highbrow baroque borders out of lowbrow pasta. And this is for a chapter that I'm doing in a book  and the chapter is on honor. So it's a little bit unexpected  but  in a way  it refers to the macaroni art that children make for their parents or they make in school and give to their parents  which is in itself a form of honor. This is what you can do with some household tinfoil. Okay  well  it's what I can do with some household tinfoil. I'm very interested in wonder  in design as an impetus to inquiring. To say I wonder is to say I question  I ask. And to experience wonder is to experience awe. So I'm currently working on a book  which plays with both senses of the word  as I explore some of my own ideas and inquiries in a visual display of rather peacock like grandeur. The world is full of wonder. But the world of graphic design  for the most part  is not. So I'm using my own writings as a kind of testing ground for a book that has an interdependency between word and image as a kind of seductive force. I think that one of the things that religions got right was the use of visual wonder to deliver a message. I think this true marriage of art and information is woefully underused in adult literature  and I'm mystified as to why visual wealth is not more commonly used to enhance intellectual wealth. When we look at works like this  we tend to associate them with children's literature. There's an implication that ornamental graphics detract from the seriousness of the content. But I really hope to have the opportunity to change that perception. This book is taking rather a long time  but I'm nearly done. For some reason  I thought it would be a good idea to put an intermission in my talk. And this is it    just to give you and me a moment to catch up. So I do these valentines. I've been sending out valentines on a fairly large scale since     . These are my valentines from      and     . And I started by doing just a single image like this and sending them out to each person. But in       I got the cockamamie idea to hand draw each valentine for everyone on my mailing list. I reduced my mailing list to     people. And I drew each person their own unique valentine and put their name on it and numbered it and signed it and sent it out. Believe it or not  I devised this as a timesaving method. I was very busy in the beginning of that year  and I didn't know when I was going to find time to design and print a single valentine. And I thought that I could kind of do this piecemeal as I was traveling. It didn't exactly work out that way. There's a longer story to this  but I did get them all done in time  and they were extremely well received. I got an almost     percent response rate. And those who didn't respond will never receive anything from me ever again. Last year  I took a more conceptual approach to the valentine. I had this idea that I wanted people to receive a kind of mysterious love letter  like a found fragment in their mailbox. I wanted it to be something that was not addressed to them or signed by me  something that caused them to wonder what on Earth this thing was. And I specifically wrote four pages that don't connect. There were four different versions of this. And I wrote them so that they begin in the middle of a sentence  end in the middle of a sentence. And they're on the one hand  universal  so I avoid specific names or places  but on the other hand  they're personal. So I wanted people to really get the sense that they had received something that could have been a love letter to them. And I'm just going to read one of them to you.  You've never really been sure of this  but I can assure you that this quirk you're so self conscious of is intensely endearing. Just please accept that this piece of you escapes with your smile  and those of us who notice are happy to catch it in passing. Time spent with you is like chasing and catching small birds  but without the scratches and bird shit.   That is to say  your thoughts and words flit and dart  disconcertedly elusive at times  but when caught and examined    ahh  such a wonder  such a delightful reward. There's no passing time with you  only collecting    the collecting of moments with the hope for preservation and at the same time release. Impossible  I don't think so. I know this makes you embarrassed. I'm certain I can see you blushing. But I just have to tell you because sometimes I hear your self doubt  and it's so crushing to think that you may not know how truly wonderful you are  how inspiring and delightful and really  truly the most completely ...  So Valentine's Day is coming up in a couple of days  and these are currently arriving in mailboxes all around the world. This year  I got  what I really have to say is a rather brilliant idea  to laser cut my valentines out of used Christmas cards. So I solicited friends to send me their used Christmas cards  and I made     of these. Each one of them is completely different. I'm just really  really thrilled with them. I don't have that much else to say  but they turned out really well. I do spend a lot of time on my work. And one of the things that I've been thinking about recently is what is worth while. What is it that's worth spending my time on and my life on in this way  Working in the commercial world  this is something that I do have to struggle with at times. And yes  sometimes I'm swayed by money. But ultimately  I don't consider that a worthy goal. What makes something worthwhile for me is the people I work for or with  the conditions I work under and the audience that I'm able to reach. So I might ask   Who is it for    What does it say   and  What does it do   You know  I have to tell you  it's really difficult for someone like me to come up on stage at this conference with these unbelievably brilliant minds  who are thinking these really big picture  world changing  life changing ideas and technologies. And it's very  very common for designers and people in the visual arts to feel that we're not contributing enough  or worse  that all we're doing is contributing to landfill. Here I am  I'm showing you some pretty visuals and talking about aesthetics. But I've come to believe that truly imaginative visual work is extremely important in society. Just in the way that I'm inspired by books and magazines of all kinds  conversations I have  movies  so I also think  when I put visual work out there into the mass media  work that is interesting  unusual  intriguing  work that maybe opens up that sense of inquiry in the mind  that I'm seeding the imagination of the populace. And you just never know who is going to take something from that and turn it into something else  because inspiration is cross pollinating. So a piece of mine may inspire a playwright or a novelist or a scientist  and that in turn may be the seed that inspires a doctor or a philanthropist or a babysitter. And this isn't something that you can quantify or track or measure  and we tend to undervalue things in society that we can't measure. But I really believe that a fully operating  rich society needs these seeds coming from all directions and all disciplines in order to keep the gears of inspiration and imagination flowing and cycling and growing. So that's why I do what I do  and why I spend so much time and effort on it  and why I work in the commercial  public sphere  as opposed to the isolated  private sphere of fine art  because I want as many people as possible to see my work  notice it  be drawn into it  and be able to take something from it. And I actually really feel that it's worthwhile to spend my valuable and limited time on this Earth in this way. And I thank you for allowing me to show it to you. It's a great pleasure to be here. It's a great pleasure to speak after Brian Cox from CERN. I think CERN is the home of the Large Hadron Collider. What ever happened to the Small Hadron Collider  Where is the Small Hadron Collider  Because the Small Hadron Collider once was the big thing. Now  the Small Hadron Collider is in a cupboard  overlooked and neglected. You know when the Large Hadron Collider started  and it didn't work  and people tried to work out why  it was the Small Hadron Collider team who sabotaged it because they were so jealous. The whole Hadron Collider family needs unlocking. The lesson of Brian's presentation  in a way    all those fantastic pictures    is this really  that vantage point determines everything that you see. What Brian was saying was science has opened up successively different vantage points from which we can see ourselves  and that's why it's so valuable. So the vantage point you take determines virtually everything that you will see. The question that you will ask will determine much of the answer that you get. And so if you ask this question  Where would you look to see the future of education  The answer that we've traditionally given to that is very straightforward  at least in the last    years  You go to Finland. Finland is the best place in the world to see school systems. The Finns may be a bit boring and depressive and there's a very high suicide rate  but by golly  they are qualified. And they have absolutely amazing education systems. So we all troop off to Finland  and we wonder at the social democratic miracle of Finland and its cultural homogeneity and all the rest of it  and then we struggle to imagine how we might bring lessons back. Well  so  for this last year  with the help of Cisco who sponsored me  for some balmy reason  to do this  I've been looking somewhere else. Because actually radical innovation does sometimes come from the very best  but it often comes from places where you have huge need    unmet  latent demand    and not enough resources for traditional solutions to work    traditional  high cost solutions  which depend on professionals  which is what schools and hospitals are. So I ended up in places like this. This is a place called Monkey Hill. It's one of the hundreds of favelas in Rio. Most of the population growth of the next    years will be in cities. We'll grow by six cities of    million people a year for the next    years. Almost all of that growth will be in the developed world. Almost all of that growth will be in places like Monkey Hill. This is where you'll find the fastest growing young populations of the world. So if you want recipes to work    for virtually anything    health  education  government politics and education    you have to go to these places. And if you go to these places  you meet people like this. This is a guy called Juanderson. At the age of     in common with many    year olds in the Brazilian education system  he dropped out of school. It was boring. And Juanderson  instead  went into what provided kind of opportunity and hope in the place that he lived  which was the drugs trade. And by the age of     with rapid promotion  he was running the drugs trade in    favelas. He was turning over         dollars a week. He employed     people. He was going to be dead by the age of   . And luckily  he met this guy  who is Rodrigo Baggio  the owner of the first laptop to ever appear in Brazil.       Rodrigo started something called CDI  which took computers donated by corporations  put them into community centers in favelas and created places like this. What turned Juanderson around was technology for learning that made learning fun and accessible. Or you can go to places like this. This is Kibera  which is the largest slum in East Africa. Millions of people living here  stretched over many kilometers. And there I met these two  Azra on the left  Maureen on the right. They just finished their Kenyan certificate of secondary education. That name should tell you that the Kenyan education system borrows almost everything from Britain  circa       but has managed to make it even worse. So there are schools in slums like this. They're places like this. That's where Maureen went to school. They're private schools. There are no state schools in slums. And the education they got was pitiful. It was in places like this. This a school set up by some nuns in another slum called Nakuru. Half the children in this classroom have no parents because they've died through AIDS. The other half have one parent because the other parent has died through AIDS. So the challenges of education in this kind of place are not to learn the kings and queens of Kenya or Britain. They are to stay alive  to earn a living  to not become HIV positive. The one technology that spans rich and poor in places like this is not anything to do with industrial technology. It's not to do with electricity or water. It's the mobile phone. If you want to design from scratch virtually any service in Africa  you would start now with the mobile phone. Or you could go to places like this. This is a place called the Madangiri Settlement Colony  which is a very developed slum about    minutes outside New Delhi  where I met these characters who showed me around for the day. The remarkable thing about these girls  and the sign of the kind of social revolution sweeping through the developing world is that these girls are not married. Ten years ago  they certainly would have been married. Now they're not married  and they want to go on to study further  to have a career. They've been brought up by mothers who are illiterate  who have never ever done homework. All across the developing world there are millions of parents    tens  hundreds of millions    who for the first time are with children doing homework and exams. And the reason they carry on studying is not because they went to a school like this. This is a private school. This is a fee pay school. This is a good school. This is the best you can get in Hyderabad in Indian education. The reason they went on studying was this. This is a computer installed in the entrance to their slum by a revolutionary social entrepreneur called Sugata Mitra who has conducted the most radical experiments  showing that children  in the right conditions  can learn on their own with the help of computers. Those girls have never touched Google. They know nothing about Wikipedia. Imagine what their lives would be like if you could get that to them. So if you look  as I did  through this tour  and by looking at about a hundred case studies of different social entrepreneurs working in these very extreme conditions  look at the recipes that they come up with for learning  they look nothing like school. What do they look like  Well  education is a global religion. And education  plus technology  is a great source of hope. You can go to places like this. This is a school three hours outside of Sao Paulo. Most of the children there have parents who are illiterate. Many of them don't have electricity at home. But they find it completely obvious to use computers  websites  make videos  so on and so forth. When you go to places like this what you see is that education in these settings works by pull  not push. Most of our education system is push. I was literally pushed to school. When you get to school  things are pushed at you  knowledge  exams  systems  timetables. If you want to attract people like Juanderson who could  for instance  buy guns  wear jewelry  ride motorbikes and get girls through the drugs trade  and you want to attract him into education  having a compulsory curriculum doesn't really make sense. That isn't really going to attract him. You need to pull him. And so education needs to work by pull  not push. And so the idea of a curriculum is completely irrelevant in a setting like this. You need to start education from things that make a difference to them in their settings. What does that  Well  the key is motivation  and there are two aspects to it. One is to deliver extrinsic motivation  that education has a payoff. Our education systems all work on the principle that there is a payoff  but you have to wait quite a long time. That's too long if you're poor. Waiting    years for the payoff from education is too long when you need to meet daily needs  when you've got siblings to look after or a business to help with. So you need education to be relevant and help people to make a living there and then  often. And you also need to make it intrinsically interesting. So time and again  I found people like this. This is an amazing guy  Sebastiao Rocha  in Belo Horizonte  in the third largest city in Brazil. He's invented more than     games to teach virtually any subject under the sun. In the schools and communities that Taio works in  the day always starts in a circle and always starts from a question. Imagine an education system that started from questions  not from knowledge to be imparted  or started from a game  not from a lesson  or started from the premise that you have to engage people first before you can possibly teach them. Our education systems  you do all that stuff afterward  if you're lucky  sport  drama  music. These things  they teach through. They attract people to learning because it's really a dance project or a circus project or  the best example of all    El Sistema in Venezuela    it's a music project. And so you attract people through that into learning  not adding that on after all the learning has been done and you've eaten your cognitive greens. So El Sistema in Venezuela uses a violin as a technology of learning. Taio Rocha uses making soap as a technology of learning. And what you find when you go to these schemes is that they use people and places in incredibly creative ways. Masses of peer learning. How do you get learning to people when there are no teachers  when teachers won't come  when you can't afford them  and even if you do get teachers  what they teach isn't relevant to the communities that they serve  Well  you create your own teachers. You create peer to peer learning  or you create para teachers  or you bring in specialist skills. But you find ways to get learning that's relevant to people through technology  people and places that are different. So this is a school in a bus on a building site in Pune  the fastest growing city in Asia. Pune has       building sites. It has        children on those building sites. That's one city. Imagine that urban explosion that's going to take place across the developing world and how many thousands of children will spend their school years on building sites. Well  this is a very simple scheme to get the learning to them through a bus. And they all treat learning  not as some sort of academic  analytical activity  but as that's something that's productive  something you make  something that you can do  perhaps earn a living from. So I met this character  Steven. He'd spent three years in Nairobi living on the streets because his parents had died of AIDS. And he was finally brought back into school  not by the offer of GCSEs  but by the offer of learning how to become a carpenter  a practical making skill. So the trendiest schools in the world  High Tech High and others  they espouse a philosophy of learning as productive activity. Here  there isn't really an option. Learning has to be productive in order for it to make sense. And finally  they have a different model of scale  and it's a Chinese restaurant model of how to scale. And I learned it from this guy  who is an amazing character. He's probably the most remarkable social entrepreneur in education in the world. His name is Madhav Chavan  and he created something called Pratham. And Pratham runs preschool play groups for  now     million children in India. It's the largest NGO in education in the world. And it also supports working class kids going into Indian schools. He's a complete revolutionary. He's actually a trade union organizer by background  and that's how he learned the skills to build his organization. When they got to a certain stage  Pratham got big enough to attract some pro bono support from McKinsey. McKinsey came along and looked at his model and said   You know what you should do with this  Madhav  You should turn it into McDonald's. And what you do when you go to any new site is you kind of roll out a franchise. And it's the same wherever you go. It's reliable and people know exactly where they are. And there will be no mistakes.  And Madhav said   Why do we have to do it that way  Why can't we do it more like the Chinese restaurants   There are Chinese restaurants everywhere  but there is no Chinese restaurant chain. Yet  everyone knows what is a Chinese restaurant. They know what to expect  even though it'll be subtly different and the colors will be different and the name will be different. You know a Chinese restaurant when you see it. These people work with the Chinese restaurant model    same principles  different applications and different settings    not the McDonald's model. The McDonald's model scales. The Chinese restaurant model spreads. So mass education started with social entrepreneurship in the   th century. And that's desperately what we need again on a global scale. And what can we learn from all of that  Well  we can learn a lot because our education systems are failing desperately in many ways. They fail to reach the people they most need to serve. They often hit their target but miss the point. Improvement is increasingly difficult to organize  our faith in these systems  incredibly fraught. And this is just a very simple way of understanding what kind of innovation  what kind of different design we need. There are two basic types of innovation. There's sustaining innovation  which will sustain an existing institution or an organization  and disruptive innovation that will break it apart  create some different way of doing it. There are formal settings    schools  colleges  hospitals    in which innovation can take place  and informal settings    communities  families  social networks. Almost all our effort goes in this box  sustaining innovation in formal settings  getting a better version of the essentially Bismarckian school system that developed in the   th century. And as I said  the trouble with this is that  in the developing world there just aren't teachers to make this model work. You'd need millions and millions of teachers in China  India  Nigeria and the rest of developing world to meet need. And in our system  we know that simply doing more of this won't eat into deep educational inequalities  especially in inner cities and former industrial areas. So that's why we need three more kinds of innovation. We need more reinvention. And all around the world now you see more and more schools reinventing themselves. They're recognizably schools  but they look different. There are Big Picture schools in the U.S. and Australia. There are Kunskapsskolan schools in Sweden. Of    of them  only two of them are in schools. Most of them are in other buildings not designed as schools. There is an amazing school in Northen Queensland called Jaringan. And they all have the same kind of features  highly collaborative  very personalized  often pervasive technology  learning that starts from questions and problems and projects  not from knowledge and curriculum. So we certainly need more of that. But because so many of the issues in education aren't just in school  they're in family and community  what you also need  definitely  is more on the right hand side. You need efforts to supplement schools. The most famous of these is Reggio Emilia in Italy  the family based learning system to support and encourage people in schools. The most exciting is the Harlem Children's Zone  which over    years  led by Geoffrey Canada  has  through a mixture of schooling and family and community projects  attempted to transform not just education in schools  but the entire culture and aspiration of about        families in Harlem. We need more of that completely new and radical thinking. You can go to places an hour away  less  from this room  just down the road  which need that  which need radicalism of a kind that we haven't imagined. And finally  you need transformational innovation that could imagine getting learning to people in completely new and different ways. So we are on the verge        of an amazing achievement  the schoolification of the world. Every child up to the age of    who wants a place in school will be able to have one in     . It's an amazing thing. But it is  unlike cars  which have developed so rapidly and orderly  actually the school system is recognizably an inheritance from the   th century  from a Bismarkian model of German schooling that got taken up by English reformers  and often by religious missionaries  taken up in the United States as a force of social cohesion  and then in Japan and South Korea as they developed. It's recognizably   th century in its roots. And of course it's a huge achievement. And of course it will bring great things. It will bring skills and learning and reading. But it will also lay waste to imagination. It will lay waste to appetite. It will lay waste to social confidence. It will stratify society as much as it liberates it. And we are bequeathing to the developing world school systems that they will now spend a century trying to reform. That is why we need really radical thinking  and why radical thinking is now more possible and more needed than ever in how we learn. Thank you.  Applause  When I was    years old  a cousin of mine took me on a tour of his medical school. And as a special treat  he took me to the pathology lab and took a real human brain out of the jar and placed it in my hands. And there it was  the seat of human consciousness  the powerhouse of the human body  sitting in my hands. And that day I knew that when I grew up  I was going to become a brain doctor  scientist  something or the other. Years later  when I finally grew up  my dream came true. And it was while I was doing my Ph.D. on the neurological causes of dyslexia in children that I encountered a startling fact that I'd like to share with you all today. It is estimated that one in six children  that's one in six children  suffer from some developmental disorder. This is a disorder that retards mental development in the child and causes permanent mental impairments. Which means that each and every one of you here today knows at least one child that is suffering from a developmental disorder. But here's what really perplexed me. Despite the fact that each and every one of these disorders originates in the brain  most of these disorders are diagnosed solely on the basis of observable behavior. But diagnosing a brain disorder without actually looking at the brain is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem based on their physical symptoms  without even doing an ECG or a chest X ray to look at the heart. It seemed so intuitive to me. To diagnose and treat a brain disorder accurately  it would be necessary to look at the brain directly. Looking at behavior alone can miss a vital piece of the puzzle and provide an incomplete  or even a misleading  picture of the child's problems. Yet  despite all the advances in medical technology  the diagnosis of brain disorders in one in six children still remained so limited. And then I came across a team at Harvard University that had taken one such advanced medical technology and finally applied it  instead of in brain research  towards diagnosing brain disorders in children. Their groundbreaking technology records the EEG  or the electrical activity of the brain  in real time  allowing us to watch the brain as it performs various functions and then detect even the slightest abnormality in any of these functions  vision  attention  language  audition. A program called Brain Electrical Activity Mapping then triangulates the source of that abnormality in the brain. And another program called Statistical Probability Mapping then performs mathematical calculations to determine whether any of these abnormalities are clinically significant  allowing us to provide a much more accurate neurological diagnosis of the child's symptoms. And so I became the head of neurophysiology for the clinical arm of this team  and we're finally able to use this technology towards actually helping children with brain disorders. And I'm happy to say that I'm now in the process of setting up this technology here in India. I'd like to tell you about one such child  whose story was also covered by ABC News. Seven year old Justin Senigar came to our clinic with this diagnosis of very severe autism. Like many autistic children  his mind was locked inside his body. There were moments when he would actually space out for seconds at a time. And the doctors told his parents he was never going to be able to communicate or interact socially  and he would probably never have too much language. When we used this groundbreaking EEG technology to actually look at Justin's brain  the results were startling. It turned out that Justin was almost certainly not autistic. He was suffering from brain seizures that were impossible to see with the naked eye  but that were actually causing symptoms that mimicked those of autism. After Justin was given anti seizure medication  the change in him was amazing. Within a period of    days  his vocabulary went from two to three words to     words. And his communication and social interaction were improved so dramatically that he was enrolled into a regular school and even became a karate super champ. Research shows that    percent of children  almost    percent of children diagnosed with autism are actually suffering from hidden brain seizures. These are the faces of the children that I have tested with stories just like Justin. All these children came to our clinic with a diagnosis of autism  attention deficit disorder  mental retardation  language problems. Instead  our EEG scans revealed very specific problems hidden within their brains that couldn't possibly have been detected by their behavioral assessments. So these EEG scans enabled us to provide these children with a much more accurate neurological diagnosis and much more targeted treatment. For too long now  children with developmental disorders have suffered from misdiagnosis while their real problems have gone undetected and left to worsen. And for too long  these children and their parents have suffered undue frustration and desperation. But we are now in a new era of neuroscience  one in which we can finally look directly at brain function in real time with no risks and no side effects  non invasively  and find the true source of so many disabilities in children. So if I could inspire even a fraction of you in the audience today to share this pioneering diagnostic approach with even one parent whose child is suffering from a developmental disorder  then perhaps one more puzzle in one more brain will be solved. One more mind will be unlocked. And one more child who has been misdiagnosed or even undiagnosed by the system will finally realize his or her true potential while there's still time for his or her brain to recover. And all this by simply watching the child's brainwaves. Thank you. So  these are the Dark Ages. And the Dark Ages are the time between when you put away the Lego for the last time as a kid  and you decide as an adult that it is okay to play with a kid's toy. Started out with my then four year old   Oh  should buy the kid some Lego. That stuff's cool.  Walked into the Lego store. Bought him this. It's totally appropriate for a four year old. I think the box says    let's see here       to     on it. I turn to my wife and said   Who are we buying this for   She's like   Oh  us.  I'm like   Okay. All right. That's cool.  Pretty soon it got a little bit out of control. The dining room looked like this. You walk there  and it hurts. So we took a room downstairs in the basement that had been used as sort of an Abu Ghraib annex. Torture  very funny. Wow  you guys are great. And we put down those little floor tiles  and then I went onto eBay and bought     pounds of Lego    which is insane. My daughter    the day we got it  I was tucking her in    and I said   Honey  you're my treasure.  And she said   No  the Lego is the treasure.  And then she said   Dad  we're Lego rich.  I was like   Yeah. I suppose we are.  So then once you do that you're like   Oh  crap. Where am I going to put all this   So you go to The Container Store and spend an enormous amount of money  and then you start this crazy sorting process that never    it's just nuts. Whatever. So then you realize there are these conventions. And you go to one of these conventions  and some dude built the Titanic. And you're like   Holy shit  He had to come in like a truck  a semi  with this thing.  And then someone built this    this is the Smith Tower in Seattle. Just beautiful. And there's a dude selling these aftermarket weapons for Lego  because Lego    the Danish    no  they're not into guns. But the Americans  Oh  we'll make some guns for Lego  no problem. And at a certain point  you look around  you're like   Whoa  this is a really nerdy crowd.  And I mean like this is a nerdy crowd  but that's like a couple of levels above furries. The nerds here  they get laid    except for the lady with the condoms in her pocket    and you say to yourself at some point   Am I part of this group  Like  am I into this   And I was just like   Yeah  I guess I am. I'm coming out. I'm kind of into this stuff  and I'm going to stop being embarrassed.  So then you really get into it  and you're like   Well  the Lego people in Denmark  they've got all this software to let you build your own virtually.  And so this is like this CAD program where you build it. And then whatever you design virtually  you click the button and it shows up at your doorstep a week later. And then some of the designs that people do they actually sell in the store. The Lego guys don't give you any royalties  strangely  but some user made this and then it sold. And it's pretty amazing actually. Then you notice that if that Lego provided CAD program isn't enough  there's an entire open source  third party  independent Lego CAD program that lets you do  D modeling and  D rendering and make  in fact  movies out of Lego   D films of which there are thousands on YouTube  and some of them sort of mimicking famous films and some totally original content    just beautiful    and people recreating all sorts of things. I have to take a moment. I love the guy who's like running away with his clasps  his hooks. Okay. Anyway. There's a whole programming language and robotics tool  so if you want to teach someone how to program  kid  adult  whatever it is. And the guy that made this  he made a slot machine out of Lego. And I don't mean he made Lego that looked like a slot machine  I mean he made a slot machine out of Lego. The insides were Lego. There's people getting drunk building Lego  and you've got to finish the thing before you puke. There's a whole gray market for Lego  thousands of home based businesses. And some people will fund their entire Lego habit by selling the little guy  but then you have no guys in your ships. And then  just some examples. This stuff really is sculpture. This is amazing what you can do. And don't kid yourself  some architectural details  incredible organic shapes and just  even  nature out of  again  little blocks. This is my house. And this is my house. I was afraid a car was going to come smash it as I was taking a picture for you guys. Anyway  I'm out of time. But just very quickly    we'll just see if I can do this quick. Because there aren't enough TED logos around here. Let's see here. Okay. Ta da. The story starts in Kenya in December of       when there was a disputed presidential election  and in the immediate aftermath of that election  there was an outbreak of ethnic violence. And there was a lawyer in Nairobi  Ory Okolloh    who some of you may know from her TEDTalk    who began blogging about it on her site  Kenyan Pundit. And shortly after the election and the outbreak of violence  the government suddenly imposed a significant media blackout. And so weblogs went from being commentary as part of the media landscape to being a critical part of the media landscape in trying to understand where the violence was. And Okolloh solicited from her commenters more information about what was going on. The comments began pouring in  and Okolloh would collate them. She would post them. And she quickly said   It's too much. I could do this all day every day and I can't keep up. There is more information about what's going on in Kenya right now than any one person can manage. If only there was a way to automate this.  And two programmers who read her blog held their hands up and said   We could do that   and in    hours  they launched Ushahidi. Ushahidi    the name means  witness  or  testimony  in Swahili    is a very simple way of taking reports from the field  whether it's from the web or  critically  via mobile phones and SMS  aggregating it and putting it on a map. That's all it is  but that's all that's needed because what it does is it takes the tacit information available to the whole population    everybody knows where the violence is  but no one person knows what everyone knows    and it takes that tacit information and it aggregates it  and it maps it and it makes it public. And that  that maneuver called  crisis mapping   was kicked off in Kenya in January of     . And enough people looked at it and found it valuable enough that the programmers who created Ushahidi decided they were going to make it open source and turn it into a platform. It's since been deployed in Mexico to track electoral fraud. It's been deployed in Washington D.C. to track snow cleanup. And it's been used most famously in Haiti in the aftermath of the earthquake. And when you look at the map now posted on the Ushahidi front page  you can see that the number of deployments in Ushahidi has gone worldwide  all right  This went from a single idea and a single implementation in East Africa in the beginning of      to a global deployment in less than three years. Now what Okolloh did would not have been possible without digital technology. What Okolloh did would not have been possible without human generosity. And the interesting moment now  the number of environments where the social design challenge relies on both of those things being true. That is the resource that I'm talking about. I call it cognitive surplus. And it represents the ability of the world's population to volunteer and to contribute and collaborate on large  sometimes global  projects. Cognitive surplus is made up of two things. The first  obviously  is the world's free time and talents. The world has over a trillion hours a year of free time to commit to shared projects. Now  that free time existed in the   th century  but we didn't get Ushahidi in the   th century. That's the second half of cognitive surplus. The media landscape in the   th century was very good at helping people consume  and we got  as a result  very good at consuming. But now that we've been given media tools    the Internet  mobile phones    that let us do more than consume  what we're seeing is that people weren't couch potatoes because we liked to be. We were couch potatoes because that was the only opportunity given to us. We still like to consume  of course. But it turns out we also like to create  and we like to share. And it's those two things together    ancient human motivation and the modern tools to allow that motivation to be joined up in large scale efforts    that are the new design resource. And using cognitive surplus  we're starting to see truly incredible experiments in scientific  literary  artistic  political efforts. Designing. We're also getting  of course  a lot of LOLcats. LOLcats are cute pictures of cats made cuter with the addition of cute captions. And they are also part of the abundant media landscape we're getting now. This is one of the participatory    one of the participatory models we see coming out of that  along with Ushahidi. Now I want to stipulate  as the lawyers say  that LOLcats are the stupidest possible creative act. There are other candidates of course  but LOLcats will do as a general case. But here's the thing  The stupidest possible creative act is still a creative act. Someone who has done something like this  however mediocre and throwaway  has tried something  has put something forward in public. And once they've done it  they can do it again  and they could work on getting it better. There is a spectrum between mediocre work and good work  and as anybody who's worked as an artist or a creator knows  it's a spectrum you're constantly struggling to get on top of. The gap is between doing anything and doing nothing. And someone who makes a LOLcat has already crossed over that gap. Now it's tempting to want to get the Ushahidis without the LOLcats  right  to get the serious stuff without the throwaway stuff. But media abundance never works that way. Freedom to experiment means freedom to experiment with anything. Even with the sacred printing press  we got erotic novels     years before we got scientific journals. So before I talk about what is  I think  the critical difference between LOLcats and Ushahidi  I want to talk about their shared source. And that source is design for generosity. It is one of the curiosities of our historical era that even as cognitive surplus is becoming a resource we can design around  social sciences are also starting to explain how important our intrinsic motivations are to us  how much we do things because we like to do them rather than because our boss told us to do them  or because we're being paid to do them. This is a graph from a paper by Uri Gneezy and Aldo Rustichini  who set out to test  at the beginning of this decade  what they called  deterrence theory.  And deterrence theory is a very simple theory of human behavior  If you want somebody to do less of something  add a punishment and they'll do less of it. Simple  straightforward  commonsensical    also  largely untested. And so they went and studied    daycare centers in Haifa  Israel. They studied those daycare centers at the time of highest tension  which is pick up time. At pick up time the teachers  who have been with your children all day  would like you to be there at the appointed hour to take your children back. Meanwhile  the parents    perhaps a little busy at work  running late  running errands    want a little slack to pick the kids up late. So Gneezy and Rustichini said   How many instances of late pick ups are there at these    daycare centers   Now they saw    and this is what the graph is  these are the number of weeks and these are the number of late arrivals    that there were between six and    instances of late pick ups on average in these    daycare centers. So they divided the daycare centers into two groups. The white group there is the control group  they change nothing. But the group of daycare centers represented by the black line  they said   We are changing this bargain as of right now. If you pick your kid up more than    minutes late  we're going to add a    shekel fine to your bill. Boom. No ifs  ands or buts.  And the minute they did that  the behavior in those daycare centers changed. Late pick ups went up every week for the next four weeks until they topped out at triple the pre fine average  and then they fluctuated at between double and triple the pre fine average for the life of the fine. And you can see immediately what happened  right  The fine broke the culture of the daycare center. By adding a fine  what they did was communicate to the parents that their entire debt to the teachers had been discharged with the payment of    shekels  and that there was no residue of guilt or social concern that the parents owed the teachers. And so the parents  quite sensibly  said      shekels to pick my kid up late  What could be bad   The explanation of human behavior that we inherited in the   th century was that we are all rational  self maximizing actors  and in that explanation    the daycare center had no contract    should have been operating without any constraints. But that's not right. They were operating with social constraints rather than contractual ones. And critically  the social constraints created a culture that was more generous than the contractual constraints did. So Gneezy and Rustichini run this experiment for a dozen weeks    run the fine for a dozen weeks    and then they say   Okay  that's it. All done  fine.  And then a really interesting thing happens  Nothing changes. The culture that got broken by the fine stayed broken when the fine was removed. Not only are economic motivations and intrinsic motivations incompatible  that incompatibility can persist over long periods. So the trick in designing these kinds of situations is to understand where you're relying on the economic part of the bargain    as with the parents paying the teachers    and when you're relying on the social part of the bargain  when you're really designing for generosity. This brings me back to the LOLcats and to Ushahidi. This is  I think  the range that matters. Both of these rely on cognitive surplus. Both of these design for the assumption that people like to create and we want to share. Here is the critical difference between these  LOLcats is communal value. It's value created by the participants for each other. Communal value on the networks we have is everywhere    every time you see a large aggregate of shared  publicly available data  whether it's photos on Flickr or videos on Youtube or whatever. This is good. I like LOLcats as much as the next guy  maybe a little more even  but this is also a largely solved problem. I have a hard time envisioning a future in which someone is saying   Where  oh where  can I find a picture of a cute cat   Ushahidi  by contrast  is civic value. It's value created by the participants but enjoyed by society as a whole. The goals set out by Ushahidi are not just to make life better for the participants  but to make life better for everyone in the society in which Ushahidi is operating. And that kind of civic value is not just a side effect of opening up to human motivation. It really is going to be a side effect of what we  collectively  make of these kinds of efforts. There are a trillion hours a year of participatory value up for grabs. That will be true year in and year out. The number of people who are going to be able to participate in these kinds of projects is going to grow  and we can see that organizations designed around a culture of generosity can achieve incredible effects without an enormous amount of contractual overhead    a very different model than our default model for large scale group action in the   th century. What's going to make the difference here is what Dean Kamen said  the inventor and entrepreneur. Kamen said   Free cultures get what they celebrate.  We've got a choice before us. We've got this trillion hours a year. We can use it to crack each other up  and we're going to do that. That  we get for free. But we can also celebrate and support and reward the people trying to use cognitive surplus to create civic value. And to the degree we're going to do that  to the degree we're able to do that  we'll be able to change society. Thank you very much. In the last    years  we've been building the suburbs with a lot of unintended consequences. And I'm going to talk about some of those consequences and just present a whole bunch of really interesting projects that I think give us tremendous reasons to be really optimistic that the big design and development project of the next    years is going to be retrofitting suburbia. So whether it's redeveloping dying malls or re inhabiting dead big box stores or reconstructing wetlands out of parking lots  I think the fact is the growing number of empty and under performing  especially retail  sites throughout suburbia gives us actually a tremendous opportunity to take our least sustainable landscapes right now and convert them into more sustainable places. And in the process  what that allows us to do is to redirect a lot more of our growth back into existing communities that could use a boost  and have the infrastructure in place  instead of continuing to tear down trees and to tear up the green space out at the edges. So why is this important  I think there are any number of reasons  and I'm just going to not get into detail but mention a few. Just from the perspective of climate change  the average urban dweller in the U.S. has about one third the carbon footprint of the average suburban dweller  mostly because suburbanites drive a lot more  and living in detached buildings  you have that much more exterior surface to leak energy out of. So strictly from a climate change perspective  the cities are already relatively green. The big opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is actually in urbanizing the suburbs. All that driving that we've been doing out in the suburbs  we have doubled the amount of miles we drive. It's increased our dependence on foreign oil despite the gains in fuel efficiency. We're just driving so much more  we haven't been able to keep up technologically. Public health is another reason to consider retrofitting. Researchers at the CDC and other places have increasingly been linking suburban development patterns with sedentary lifestyles. And those have been linked then with the rather alarming  growing rates of obesity  shown in these maps here  and that obesity has also been triggering great increases in heart disease and diabetes to the point where a child born today has a one in three chance of developing diabetes. And that rate has been escalating at the same rate as children not walking to school anymore  again  because of our development patterns. And then there's finally    there's the affordability question. I mean  how affordable is it to continue to live in suburbia with rising gas prices  Suburban expansion to cheap land  for the last    years    you know the cheap land out on the edge    has helped generations of families enjoy the American dream. But increasingly  the savings promised by drive till you qualify affordability    which is basically our model    those savings are wiped out when you consider the transportation costs. For instance  here in Atlanta  about half of households make between         and         a year  and they are spending    percent of their income on housing and    percent on transportation. I mean  that's      figures. That's before we got up to the four bucks a gallon. You know  none of us really tend to do the math on our transportation costs  and they're not going down any time soon. Whether you love suburbia's leafy privacy or you hate its soulless commercial strips  there are reasons why it's important to retrofit. But is it practical  I think it is. June Williamson and I have been researching this topic for over a decade  and we've found over    varied projects. But that they're really all market driven  and what's driving the market in particular    number one    is major demographic shifts. We all tend to think of suburbia as this very family focused place  but that's really not the case anymore. Since       already two thirds of households in suburbia did not have kids in them. We just haven't caught up with the actual realities of this. The reasons for this have a lot to with the dominance of the two big demographic groups right now  the Baby Boomers retiring    and then there's a gap  Generation X  which is a small generation. They're still having kids    but Generation Y hasn't even started hitting child rearing age. They're the other big generation. So as a result of that  demographers predict that through          to    percent of new households will not have kids in them. And the market research  consumer research  asking the Boomers and Gen Y what it is they would like  what they would like to live in  tells us there is going to be a huge demand    and we're already seeing it    for more urban lifestyles within suburbia. That basically  the Boomers want to be able to age in place  and Gen Y would like to live an urban lifestyle  but most of their jobs will continue to be out in suburbia. The other big dynamic of change is the sheer performance of underperforming asphalt. Now I keep thinking this would be a great name for an indie rock band  but developers generally use it to refer to underused parking lots    and suburbia is full of them. When the postwar suburbs were first built out on the cheap land away from downtown  it made sense to just build surface parking lots. But those sites have now been leapfrogged and leapfrogged again  as we've just continued to sprawl  and they now have a relatively central location. It no longer just makes sense. That land is more valuable than just surface parking lots. It now makes sense to go back in  build a deck and build up on those sites. So what do you do with a dead mall  dead office park  It turns out  all sorts of things. In a slow economy like ours  re inhabitation is one of the more popular strategies. So this happens to be a dead mall in St. Louis that's been re inhabited as art space. It's now home to artist studios  theater groups  dance troupes. It's not pulling in as much tax revenue as it once was  but it's serving its community. It's keeping the lights on. It's becoming  I think  a really great institution. Other malls have been re inhabited as nursing homes  as universities  and as all variety of office space. We also found a lot of examples of dead big box stores that have been converted into all sorts of community serving uses as well    lots of schools  lots of churches and lots of libraries like this one. This was a little grocery store  a Food Lion grocery store  that is now a public library. In addition to  I think  doing a beautiful adaptive reuse  they tore up some of the parking spaces  put in bioswales to collect and clean the runoff  put in a lot more sidewalks to connect to the neighborhoods. And they've made this  what was just a store along a commercial strip  into a community gathering space. This one is a little L shaped strip shopping center in Phoenix  Arizona. Really all they did was they gave it a fresh coat of bright paint  a gourmet grocery  and they put up a restaurant in the old post office. Never underestimate the power of food to turn a place around and make it a destination. It's been so successful  they've now taken over the strip across the street. The real estate ads in the neighborhood all very proudly proclaim   Walking distance to Le Grande Orange   because it provided its neighborhood with what sociologists like to call  a third place.  If home is the first place and work is the second place  the third place is where you go to hang out and build community. And especially as suburbia is becoming less centered on the family  the family households  there's a real hunger for more third places. So the most dramatic retrofits are really those in the next category  the next strategy  redevelopment. Now  during the boom  there were several really dramatic redevelopment projects where the original building was scraped to the ground and then the whole site was rebuilt at significantly greater density  a sort of compact  walkable urban neighborhoods. But some of them have been much more incremental. This is Mashpee Commons  the oldest retrofit that we've found. And it's just incrementally  over the last    years  built urbanism on top of its parking lots. So the black and white photo shows the simple   's strip shopping center. And then the maps above that show its gradual transformation into a compact  mixed use New England village  and it has plans now that have been approved for it to connect to new residential neighborhoods across the arterials and over to the other side. So  you know  sometimes it's incremental. Sometimes  it's all at once. This is another infill project on the parking lots  this one of an office park outside of Washington D.C. When Metrorail expanded transit into the suburbs and opened a station nearby to this site  the owners decided to build a new parking deck and then insert on top of their surface lots a new Main Street  several apartments and condo buildings  while keeping the existing office buildings. Here is the site in       It was just a little farm in the village of Hyattsville. By       it had been subdivided into a big mall on one side and the office park on the other and then some buffer sites for a library and a church to the far right. Today  the transit  the Main Street and the new housing have all been built. Eventually  I expect that the streets will probably extend through a redevelopment of the mall. Plans have already been announced for a lot of those garden apartments above the mall to be redeveloped. Transit is a big driver of retrofits. So here's what it looks like. You can sort of see the funky new condo buildings in between the office buildings and the public space and the new Main Street. This one is one of my favorites  Belmar. I think they really built an attractive place here and have just employed all green construction. There's massive P.V. arrays on the roofs as well as wind turbines. This was a very large mall on a hundred acre superblock. It's now    walkable urban blocks with public streets  two public parks  eight bus lines and a range of housing types  and so it's really given Lakewood  Colorado the downtown that this particular suburb never had. Here was the mall in its heyday. They had their prom in the mall. They loved their mall. So here's the site in      with the mall. By       the mall has died. The department store has been kept    and we found this was true in many cases. The department stores are multistory  they're better built. They're easy to be re adapted. But the one story stuff ... that's really history. So here it is at projected build out. This project  I think  has great connectivity to the existing neighborhoods. It's providing       households with the option of a more urban lifestyle. It's about two thirds built out right now. Here's what the new Main Street looks like. It's very successful  and it's helped to prompt    eight of the    regional malls in Denver have now  or have announced plans to be  retrofitted. But it's important to note that all of this retrofitting is not occurring    just bulldozers are coming and just plowing down the whole city. No  it's pockets of walkability on the sites of under performing properties. And so it's giving people more choices  but it's not taking away choices. But it's also not really enough to just create pockets of walkability. You want to also try to get more systemic transformation. We need to also retrofit the corridors themselves. So this is one that has been retrofitted in California. They took the commercial strip shown on the black and white images below  and they built a boulevard that has become the Main Street for their town. And it's transformed from being an ugly  unsafe  undesirable address  to becoming a beautiful  attractive  dignified sort of good address. I mean now we're hoping we start to see it  they've already built City Hall  attracted two hotels. I could imagine beautiful housing going up along there without tearing down another tree. So there's a lot of great things  but I'd love to see more corridors getting retrofitting. But densification is not going to work everywhere. Sometimes re greening is really the better answer. There's a lot to learn from successful landbanking programs in cities like Flint  Michigan. There's also a burgeoning suburban farming movement    sort of victory gardens meets the Internet. But perhaps one of the most important re greening aspects is the opportunity to restore the local ecology  as in this example outside of Minneapolis. When the shopping center died  the city restored the site's original wetlands  creating lakefront property  which then attracted private investment  the first private investment to this very low income neighborhood in over    years. So they've managed to both restore the local ecology and the local economy at the same time. This is another re greening example. It also makes sense in very strong markets. This one in Seattle is on the site of a mall parking lot adjacent to a new transit stop. And the wavy line is a path alongside a creek that has now been daylit. The creek had been culverted under the parking lot. But daylighting our creeks really improves their water quality and contributions to habitat. So I've shown you some of the first generation of retrofits. What's next  I think we have three challenges for the future. The first is to plan retrofitting much more systemically at the metropolitan scale. We need to be able to target which areas really should be re greened. Where should we be redeveloping  And where should we be encouraging re inhabitation  These slides just show two images from a larger project that looked at trying to do that for Atlanta. I led a team that was asked to imagine Atlanta     years from now. And we chose to try to reverse sprawl through three simple moves    expensive  but simple. One  in a hundred years  transit on all major rail and road corridors. Two  in a hundred years  thousand foot buffers on all stream corridors. It's a little extreme  but we've got a little water problem. In a hundred years  subdivisions that simply end up too close to water or too far from transit won't be viable. And so we've created the eco acre transfer to transfer development rights to the transit corridors and allow the re greening of those former subdivisions for food and energy production. So the second challenge is to improve the architectural design quality of the retrofits. And I close with this image of democracy in action  This is a protest that's happening on a retrofit in Silver Spring  Maryland on an Astroturf town green. Now  retrofits are often accused of being examples of faux downtowns and instant urbanism  and not without reason  you don't get much more phony than an Astroturf town green. I have to say  these are very hybrid places. They are new but trying to look old. They have urban streetscapes  but suburban parking ratios. Their populations are more diverse than typical suburbia  but they're less diverse than cities. And they are public places  but that are managed by private companies. And just the surface appearance are often    like the Astroturf here    they make me wince. So  you know  I mean I'm glad that the urbanism is doing its job. The fact that a protest is happening really does mean that the layout of the blocks  the streets and blocks  the putting in of public space  compromised as it may be  is still a really great thing. But we've got to get the architecture better. The final challenge is for all of you. I want you to join the protest and start demanding more sustainable suburban places    more sustainable places  period. But culturally  we tend to think that downtowns should be dynamic  and we expect that. But we seem to have an expectation that the suburbs should forever remain frozen in whatever adolescent form they were first given birth to. It's time to let them grow up  so I want you to all support the zoning changes  the road diets  the infrastructure improvements and the retrofits that are coming soon to a neighborhood near you. Thank you. It can be a very complicated thing  the ocean. And it can be a very complicated thing  what human health is. And bringing those two together might seem a very daunting task  but what I'm going to try to say is that even in that complexity  there's some simple themes that I think  if we understand  we can really move forward. And those simple themes aren't really themes about the complex science of what's going on  but things that we all pretty well know. And I'm going to start with this one  If momma ain't happy  ain't nobody happy. We know that  right  We've experienced that. And if we just take that and we build from there  then we can go to the next step  which is that if the ocean ain't happy  ain't nobody happy. That's the theme of my talk. And we're making the ocean pretty unhappy in a lot of different ways. This is a shot of Cannery Row in     . Cannery Row  at the time  had the biggest industrial canning operation on the west coast. We piled enormous amounts of pollution into the air and into the water. Rolf Bolin  who was a professor at the Hopkin's Marine Station where I work  wrote in the     s that  The fumes from the scum floating on the inlets of the bay were so bad they turned lead based paints black.  People working in these canneries could barely stay there all day because of the smell  but you know what they came out saying  They say   You know what you smell  You smell money.  That pollution was money to that community  and those people dealt with the pollution and absorbed it into their skin and into their bodies because they needed the money. We made the ocean unhappy  we made people very unhappy  and we made them unhealthy. The connection between ocean health and human health is actually based upon another couple simple adages  and I want to call that  pinch a minnow  hurt a whale.  The pyramid of ocean life ... Now  when an ecologist looks at the ocean    I have to tell you    we look at the ocean in a very different way  and we see different things than when a regular person looks at the ocean because when an ecologist looks at the ocean  we see all those interconnections. We see the base of the food chain  the plankton  the small things  and we see how those animals are food to animals in the middle of the pyramid  and on so up this diagram. And that flow  that flow of life  from the very base up to the very top  is the flow that ecologists see. And that's what we're trying to preserve when we say   Save the ocean. Heal the ocean.  It's that pyramid. Now why does that matter for human health  Because when we jam things in the bottom of that pyramid that shouldn't be there  some very frightening things happen. Pollutants  some pollutants have been created by us  molecules like PCBs that can't be broken down by our bodies. And they go in the base of that pyramid  and they drift up  they're passed up that way  on to predators and on to the top predators  and in so doing  they accumulate. Now  to bring that home  I thought I'd invent a little game. We don't really have to play it  we can just think about it here. It's the Styrofoam and chocolate game. Imagine that when we got on this boat  we were all given two Styrofoam peanuts. Can't do much with them  Put them in your pocket. Suppose the rules are  every time you offer somebody a drink  you give them the drink  and you give them your Styrofoam peanuts too. What'll happen is that the Styrofoam peanuts will start moving through our society here  and they will accumulate in the drunkest  stingiest people. There's no mechanism in this game for them to go anywhere but into a bigger and bigger pile of indigestible Styrofoam peanuts. And that's exactly what happens with PDBs in this food pyramid  They accumulate into the top of it. Now suppose  instead of Styrofoam peanuts  we take these lovely little chocolates that we get and we had those instead. Well  some of us would be eating those chocolates instead of passing them around  and instead of accumulating  they will just pass into our group here and not accumulate in any one group because they're absorbed by us. And that's the difference between a PCB and  say  something natural like an omega    something we want out of the marine food chain. PCBs accumulate. We have great examples of that  unfortunately. PCBs accumulate in dolphins in Sarasota Bay  in Texas  in North Carolina. They get into the food chain. The dolphins eat the fish that have PCBs from the plankton  and those PCBs  being fat soluble  accumulate in these dolphins. Now  a dolphin  mother dolphin  any dolphin    there's only one way that a PCB can get out of a dolphin. And what's that  In mother's milk. Here's a diagram of the PCB load of dolphins in Sarasota Bay. Adult males  a huge load. Juveniles  a huge load. Females after their first calf is already weaned  a lower load. Those females  they're not trying to. Those females are passing the PCBs in the fat of their own mother's milk into their offspring  and their offspring don't survive. The death rate in these dolphins  for the first calf born of every female dolphin  is    to    percent. These mothers pump their first offspring full of this pollutant  and most of them die. Now  the mother then can go and reproduce  but what a terrible price to pay for the accumulation of this pollutant in these animals    the death of the first born calf. There's another top predator in the ocean  it turns out. That top predator  of course  is us. And we also are eating meat that comes from some of these same places. This is whale meat that I photographed in a grocery store in Tokyo    or is it  In fact  what we did a few years ago was learn how to smuggle a molecular biology lab into Tokyo and use it to genetically test the DNA out of whale meat samples and identify what they really were. And some of those whale meat samples were whale meat. Some of them were illegal whale meat  by the way. That's another story. But some of them were not whale meat at all. Even though they were labeled whale meat  they were dolphin meat. Some of them were dolphin liver. Some of them were dolphin blubber. And those dolphin parts had a huge load of PCBs  dioxins and heavy metals. And that huge load was passing into the people that ate this meat. It turns out that a lot of dolphins are being sold as meat in the whale meat market around the world. That's a tragedy for those populations  but it's also a tragedy for the people eating them because they don't know that that's toxic meat. We had these data a few years ago. I remember sitting at my desk being about the only person in the world who knew that whale meat being sold in these markets was really dolphin meat  and it was toxic. It had two to three to     times the toxic loads ever allowed by the EPA. And I remember there sitting at my desk thinking   Well  I know this. This is a great scientific discovery   but it was so awful. And for the very first time in my scientific career  I broke scientific protocol  which is that you take the data and publish them in scientific journals and then begin to talk about them. We sent a very polite letter to the Minister of Health in Japan and simply pointed out that this is an intolerable situation  not for us  but for the people of Japan because mothers who may be breastfeeding  who may have young children  would be buying something that they thought was healthy  but it was really toxic. That led to a whole series of other campaigns in Japan  and I'm really proud to say that at this point  it's very difficult to buy anything in Japan that's labeled incorrectly  even though they're still selling whale meat  which I believe they shouldn't. But at least it's labeled correctly  and you're no longer going to be buying toxic dolphin meat instead. It isn't just there that this happens  but in a natural diet of some communities in the Canadian arctic and in the United States and in the European arctic  a natural diet of seals and whales leads to an accumulation of PCBs that have gathered up from all parts of the world and ended up in these women. These women have toxic breast milk. They cannot feed their offspring  their children  their breast milk because of the accumulation of these toxins in their food chain  in their part of the world's ocean pyramid. That means their immune systems are compromised. It means that their children's development can be compromised. And the world's attention on this over the last decade has reduced the problem for these women  not by changing the pyramid  but by changing what they particularly eat out of it. We've taken them out of their natural pyramid in order to solve this problem. That's a good thing for this particular acute problem  but it does nothing to solve the pyramid problem. There's other ways of breaking the pyramid. The pyramid  if we jam things in the bottom  can get backed up like a sewer line that's clogged. And if we jam nutrients  sewage  fertilizer in the base of that food pyramid  it can back up all through it. We end up with things we've heard about before  red tides  for example  which are blooms of toxic algae floating through the oceans causing neurological damage. We can also see blooms of bacteria  blooms of viruses in the ocean. These are two shots of a red tide coming on shore here and a bacteria in the genus vibrio  which includes the genus that has cholera in it. How many people have seen a  beach closed  sign  Why does that happen  It happens because we have jammed so much into the base of the natural ocean pyramid that these bacteria clog it up and overfill onto our beaches. Often what jams us up is sewage. Now how many of you have ever gone to a state park or a national park where you had a big sign at the front saying   Closed because human sewage is so far over this park that you can't use it   Not very often. We wouldn't tolerate that. We wouldn't tolerate our parks being swamped by human sewage  but beaches are closed a lot in our country. They're closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason  and I believe we shouldn't tolerate that either. It's not just a question of cleanliness  it's also a question of how those organisms then turn into human disease. These vibrios  these bacteria  can actually infect people. They can go into your skin and create skin infections. This is a graph from NOAA's ocean and human health initiative  showing the rise of the infections by vibrio in people over the last few years. Surfers  for example  know this incredibly. And if you can see on some surfing sites  in fact  not only do you see what the waves are like or what the weather's like  but on some surf rider sites  you see a little flashing poo alert. That means that the beach might have great waves  but it's a dangerous place for surfers to be because they can carry with them  even after a great day of surfing  this legacy of an infection that might take a very long time to solve. Some of these infections are actually carrying antibiotic resistance genes now  and that makes them even more difficult. These same infections create harmful algal blooms. Those blooms are generating other kinds of chemicals. This is just a simple list of some of the types of poisons that come out of these harmful algal blooms  shellfish poisoning fish ciguatera  diarrheic shellfish poisoning    you don't want to know about that    neurotoxic shellfish poisoning  paralytic shellfish poisoning. These are things that are getting into our food chain because of these blooms. Rita Calwell very famously traced a very interesting story of cholera into human communities  brought there  not by a normal human vector  but by a marine vector  this copepod. Copepods are small crustaceans. They're a tiny fraction of an inch long  and they can carry on their little legs some of the cholera bacteria that then leads to human disease. That has sparked cholera epidemics in ports along the world and has led to increased concentration on trying to make sure shipping doesn't move these vectors of cholera around the world. So what do you do  We have major problems in disrupted ecosystem flow that the pyramid may not be working so well  that the flow from the base up into it is being blocked and clogged. What do you do when you have this sort of disrupted flow  Well  there's a bunch of things you could do. You could call Joe the Plumber  for example. And he could come in and fix the flow. But in fact  if you look around the world  not only are there hope spots for where we may be able to fix problems  there have been places where problems have been fixed  where people have come to grips with these issues and begun to turn them around. Monterey is one of those. I started out showing how much we had distressed the Monterey Bay ecosystem with pollution and the canning industry and all of the attendant problems. In       that's the picture. In       the picture is dramatically different. The canneries are gone. The pollution has abated. But there's a greater sense here that what the individual communities need is working ecosystems. They need a functioning pyramid from the base all the way to the top. And that pyramid in Monterey  right now  because of the efforts of a lot of different people  is functioning better than it's ever functioned for the last     years. It didn't happen accidentally. It happened because many people put their time and effort and their pioneering spirit into this. On the left there  Julia Platt  the mayor of my little hometown in Pacific Grove. At    years old  became mayor because something had to be done to protect the ocean. In       she produced California's first community based marine protected area  right next to the biggest polluting cannery  because Julia knew that when the canneries eventually were gone  the ocean needed a place to grow from  that the ocean needed a place to spark a seed  and she wanted to provide that seed. Other people  like David Packard and Julie Packard  who were instrumental in producing the Monterey Bay aquarium to lock into people's notion that the ocean and the health of the ocean ecosystem were just as important to the economy of this area as eating the ecosystem would be. That change in thinking has led to a dramatic shift  not only in the fortunes of Monterey Bay  but other places around the world. Well  I want to leave you with the thought that what we're really trying to do here is protect this ocean pyramid  and that ocean pyramid connects to our own pyramid of life. It's an ocean planet  and we think of ourselves as a terrestrial species  but the pyramid of life in the ocean and our own lives on land are intricately connected. And it's only through having the ocean being healthy that we can remain healthy ourselves. Thank you very much. It's a great honor today to share with you The Digital Universe  which was created for humanity to really see where we are in the universe. And so I think we can roll the video that we have.  The Himalayas.  The flat horizon that we've evolved with has been a metaphor for the infinite  unbounded resources and unlimited capacity for disposal of waste. It wasn't until we really left Earth  got above the atmosphere and had seen the horizon bend back on itself  that we could understand our planet as a limited condition. The Digital Universe Atlas has been built at the American Museum of Natural History over the past    years. We maintain that  put that together as a project to really chart the universe across all scales. What we see here are satellites around the Earth and the Earth in proper registration against the universe  as we see. NASA supported this work    years ago as part of the rebuilding of the Hayden Planetarium so that we would share this with the world. The Digital Universe is the basis of our space show productions that we do    our main space shows in the dome. But what you see here is the result of  actually  internships that we hosted with Linkoping University in Sweden. I've had    students work on this for their graduate work  and the result has been this software called Uniview and a company called SCISS in Sweden. This software allows interactive use  so this actual flight path and movie that we see here was actually flown live. I captured this live from my laptop in a cafe called Earth Matters on the Lower East Side of Manhattan  where I live  and it was done as a collaborative project with the Rubin Museum of Himalayan Art for an exhibit on comparative cosmology. And so as we move out  we see continuously from our planet all the way out into the realm of galaxies  as we see here  light travel time  giving you a sense of how far away we are. As we move out  the light from these distant galaxies have taken so long  we're essentially backing up into the past. We back so far up we're finally seeing a containment around us    the afterglow of the Big Bang. This is the WMAP microwave background that we see. We'll fly outside it here  just to see this sort of containment. If we were outside this  it would almost be meaningless  in the sense as before time. But this our containment of the visible universe. We know the universe is bigger than that which we can see. Coming back quickly  we see here the radio sphere that we jumped out of in the beginning  but these are positions  the latest positions of exoplanets that we've mapped  and our sun here  obviously  with our own solar system. What you're going to see    we're going to have to jump in here pretty quickly between several orders of magnitude to get down to where we see the solar system    these are the paths of Voyager    Voyager    Pioneer    and Pioneer     the first four spacecraft to have left the solar system. Coming in closer  picking up Earth  orbit of the Moon  and we see the Earth. This map can be updated  and we can add in new data. I know Dr. Carolyn Porco is the camera P.I. for the Cassini mission. But here we see the complex trajectory of the Cassini mission color coded for different mission phases  ingeniously developed so that    encounters with the largest moon  Titan  which is larger that the planet Mercury  diverts the orbit into different parts of mission phase. This software allows us to come close and look at parts of this. This software can also be networked between domes. We have a growing user base of this  and we network domes. And we can network between domes and classrooms. We're actually sharing tours of the universe with the first sub Saharan planetarium in Ghana as well as new libraries that have been built in the ghettos in Columbia and a high school in Cambodia. And the Cambodians have actually controlled the Hayden Planetarium from their high school. This is an image from Saturday  photographed by the Aqua satellite  but through the Uniview software. So you're seeing the edge of the Earth. This is Nepal. This is  in fact  right here is the valley of Lhasa  right here in Tibet. But we can see the haze from fires and so forth in the Ganges valley down below in India. This is Nepal and Tibet. And just in closing  I'd just like to say this beautiful world that we live on    here we see a bit of the snow that some of you may have had to brave in coming out    so I'd like to just say that what the world needs now is a sense of being able to look at ourselves in this much larger condition now and a much larger sense of what home is. Because our home is the universe  and we are the universe  essentially. We carry that in us. And to be able to see our context in this larger sense at all scales helps us all  I think  in understanding where we are and who we are in the universe. Thank you. Why grow homes  Because we can. Right now  America is in an unremitting state of trauma. And there's a cause for that  all right. We've got McPeople  McCars  McHouses. As an architect  I have to confront something like this. So what's a technology that will allow us to make ginormous houses  Well  it's been around for       years. It's called pleaching  or grafting trees together  or grafting inosculate matter into one contiguous  vascular system. And we do something different than what we did in the past  we add kind of a modicum of intelligence to that. We use CNC to make scaffolding to train semi epithetic matter  plants  into a specific geometry that makes a home that we call a Fab Tree Hab. It fits into the environment. It is the environment. It is the landscape  right  And you can have a hundred million of these homes  and it's great because they suck carbon. They're perfect. You can have     million families  or take things out of the suburbs  because these are homes that are a part of the environment. Imagine pre growing a village    it takes about seven to    years    and everything is green. So not only do we do the veggie house  we also do the in vitro meat habitat  or homes that we're doing research on now in Brooklyn  where  as an architecture office  we're for the first of its kind to put in a molecular cell biology lab and start experimenting with regenerative medicine and tissue engineering and start thinking about what the future would be if architecture and biology became one. So we've been doing this for a couple of years  and that's our lab. And what we do is we grow extracellular matrix from pigs. We use a modified inkjet printer  and we print geometry. We print geometry where we can make industrial design objects like  you know  shoes  leather belts  handbags  etc.  where no sentient creature is harmed. It's victimless. It's meat from a test tube. So our theory is that eventually we should be doing this with homes. So here is a typical stud wall  an architectural construction  and this is a section of our proposal for a meat house  where you can see we use fatty cells as insulation  cilia for dealing with wind loads and sphincter muscles for the doors and windows. And we know it's incredibly ugly. It could have been an English Tudor or Spanish Colonial  but we kind of chose this shape. And there it is kind of grown  at least one particular section of it. We had a big show in Prague  and we decided to put it in front of the cathedral so religion can confront the house of meat. That's why we grow homes. Thanks very much. Thank you very much. Please excuse me for sitting  I'm very old. Well  the topic I'm going to discuss is one which is  in a certain sense  very peculiar because it's very old. Roughness is part of human life forever and forever  and ancient authors have written about it. It was very much uncontrollable  and in a certain sense  it seemed to be the extreme of complexity  just a mess  a mess and a mess. There are many different kinds of mess. Now  in fact  by a complete fluke  I got involved many years ago in a study of this form of complexity  and to my utter amazement  I found traces    very strong traces  I must say    of order in that roughness. And so today  I would like to present to you a few examples of what this represents. I prefer the word roughness to the word irregularity because irregularity    to someone who had Latin in my long past youth    means the contrary of regularity. But it is not so. Regularity is the contrary of roughness because the basic aspect of the world is very rough. So let me show you a few objects. Some of them are artificial. Others of them are very real  in a certain sense. Now this is the real. It's a cauliflower. Now why do I show a cauliflower  a very ordinary and ancient vegetable  Because old and ancient as it may be  it's very complicated and it's very simple  both at the same time. If you try to weigh it    of course it's very easy to weigh it  and when you eat it  the weight matters    but suppose you try to measure its surface. Well  it's very interesting. If you cut  with a sharp knife  one of the florets of a cauliflower and look at it separately  you think of a whole cauliflower  but smaller. And then you cut again  again  again  again  again  again  again  again  again  and you still get small cauliflowers. So the experience of humanity has always been that there are some shapes which have this peculiar property  that each part is like the whole  but smaller. Now  what did humanity do with that  Very  very little. So what I did actually is to study this problem  and I found something quite surprising. That one can measure roughness by a number  a number   .    .  and sometimes much more. One day  a friend of mine  to bug me  brought a picture and said   What is the roughness of this curve   I said   Well  just short of  . .  It was  .  . Now  it didn't take me any time. I've been looking at these things for so long. So these numbers are the numbers which denote the roughness of these surfaces. I hasten to say that these surfaces are completely artificial. They were done on a computer  and the only input is a number  and that number is roughness. So on the left  I took the roughness copied from many landscapes. To the right  I took a higher roughness. So the eye  after a while  can distinguish these two very well. Humanity had to learn about measuring roughness. This is very rough  and this is sort of smooth  and this perfectly smooth. Very few things are very smooth. So then if you try to ask questions   What's the surface of a cauliflower   Well  you measure and measure and measure. Each time you're closer  it gets bigger  down to very  very small distances. What's the length of the coastline of these lakes  The closer you measure  the longer it is. The concept of length of coastline  which seems to be so natural because it's given in many cases  is  in fact  complete fallacy  there's no such thing. You must do it differently. What good is that  to know these things  Well  surprisingly enough  it's good in many ways. To begin with  artificial landscapes  which I invented sort of  are used in cinema all the time. We see mountains in the distance. They may be mountains  but they may be just formulae  just cranked on. Now it's very easy to do. It used to be very time consuming  but now it's nothing. Now look at that. That's a real lung. Now a lung is something very strange. If you take this thing  you know very well it weighs very little. The volume of a lung is very small  but what about the area of the lung  Anatomists were arguing very much about that. Some say that a normal male's lung has an area of the inside of a basketball  court . And the others say  no  five basketball  courts . Enormous disagreements. Why so  Because  in fact  the area of the lung is something very ill defined. The bronchi branch  branch  branch and they stop branching  not because of any matter of principle  but because of physical considerations  the mucus  which is in the lung. So what happens is that in a way you have a much bigger lung  but it branches and branches down to distances about the same for a whale  for a man and for a little rodent. Now  what good is it to have that  Well  surprisingly enough  amazingly enough  the anatomists had a very poor idea of the structure of the lung until very recently. And I think that my mathematics  surprisingly enough  has been of great help to the surgeons studying lung illnesses and also kidney illnesses  all these branching systems  for which there was no geometry. So I found myself  in other words  constructing a geometry  a geometry of things which had no geometry. And a surprising aspect of it is that very often  the rules of this geometry are extremely short. You have formulas that long. And you crank it several times. Sometimes repeatedly  again  again  again  the same repetition. And at the end  you get things like that. This cloud is completely      percent artificial. Well    . . And the only part which is natural is a number  the roughness of the cloud  which is taken from nature. Something so complicated like a cloud  so unstable  so varying  should have a simple rule behind it. Now this simple rule is not an explanation of clouds. The seer of clouds had to take account of it. I don't know how much advanced these pictures are. They're old. I was very much involved in it  but then turned my attention to other phenomena. Now  here is another thing which is rather interesting. One of the shattering events in the history of mathematics  which is not appreciated by many people  occurred about     years ago      years ago. Mathematicians began to create shapes that didn't exist. Mathematicians got into self praise to an extent which was absolutely amazing  that man can invent things that nature did not know. In particular  it could invent things like a curve which fills the plane. A curve's a curve  a plane's a plane  and the two won't mix. Well  they do mix. A man named Peano did define such curves  and it became an object of extraordinary interest. It was very important  but mostly interesting because a kind of break  a separation between the mathematics coming from reality  on the one hand  and new mathematics coming from pure man's mind. Well  I was very sorry to point out that the pure man's mind has  in fact  seen at long last what had been seen for a long time. And so here I introduce something  the set of rivers of a plane filling curve. And well  it's a story unto itself. So it was in      to       an extraordinary period in which mathematics prepared itself to break out from the world. And the objects which were used as examples  when I was a child and a student  as examples of the break between mathematics and visible reality    those objects  I turned them completely around. I used them for describing some of the aspects of the complexity of nature. Well  a man named Hausdorff in      introduced a number which was just a mathematical joke  and I found that this number was a good measurement of roughness. When I first told it to my friends in mathematics they said   Don't be silly. It's just something  silly .  Well actually  I was not silly. The great painter Hokusai knew it very well. The things on the ground are algae. He did not know the mathematics  it didn't yet exist. And he was Japanese who had no contact with the West. But painting for a long time had a fractal side. I could speak of that for a long time. The Eiffel Tower has a fractal aspect. I read the book that Mr. Eiffel wrote about his tower  and indeed it was astonishing how much he understood. This is a mess  mess  mess  Brownian loop. One day I decided    halfway through my career  I was held by so many things in my work    I decided to test myself. Could I just look at something which everybody had been looking at for a long time and find something dramatically new  Well  so I looked at these things called Brownian motion    just goes around. I played with it for a while  and I made it return to the origin. Then I was telling my assistant   I don't see anything. Can you paint it   So he painted it  which means he put inside everything. He said   Well  this thing came out ...  And I said   Stop  Stop  Stop  I see  it's an island.  And amazing. So Brownian motion  which happens to have a roughness number of two  goes around. I measured it   .  . Again  again  again. Long measurements  big Brownian motions   .  . Mathematical problem  how to prove it  It took my friends    years. Three of them were having incomplete proofs. They got together  and together they had the proof. So they got the big  Fields  medal in mathematics  one of the three medals that people have received for proving things which I've seen without being able to prove them. Now everybody asks me at one point or another   How did it all start  What got you in that strange business   What got you to be  at the same time  a mechanical engineer  a geographer and a mathematician and so on  a physicist  Well actually I started  oddly enough  studying stock market prices. And so here I had this theory  and I wrote books about it    financial prices increments. To the left you see data over a long period. To the right  on top  you see a theory which is very  very fashionable. It was very easy  and you can write many books very fast about it. There are thousands of books on that. Now compare that with real price increments. Where are real price increments  Well  these other lines include some real price increments and some forgery which I did. So the idea there was that one must be able to    how do you say     model price variation. And it went really well    years ago. For    years  people were sort of pooh poohing me because they could do it much  much easier. But I tell you  at this point  people listened to me. These two curves are averages  Standard   Poor  the blue one  and the red one is Standard   Poor's from which the five biggest discontinuities are taken out. Now discontinuities are a nuisance  so in many studies of prices  one puts them aside.  Well  acts of God. And you have the little nonsense which is left. Acts of God.  In this picture  five acts of God are as important as everything else. In other words  it is not acts of God that we should put aside. That is the meat  the problem. If you master these  you master price  and if you don't master these  you can master the little noise as well as you can  but it's not important. Well  here are the curves for it. Now  I get to the final thing  which is the set of which my name is attached. In a way  it's the story of my life. My adolescence was spent during the German occupation of France. Since I thought that I might vanish within a day or a week  I had very big dreams. And after the war  I saw an uncle again. My uncle was a very prominent mathematician  and he told me   Look  there's a problem which I could not solve    years ago  and which nobody can solve. This is a construction of a man named  Gaston  Julia and  Pierre  Fatou. If you could find something new  anything  you will get your career made.  Very simple. So I looked  and like the thousands of people that had tried before  I found nothing. But then the computer came  and I decided to apply the computer  not to new problems in mathematics    like this wiggle wiggle  that's a new problem    but to old problems. And I went from what's called real numbers  which are points on a line  to imaginary  complex numbers  which are points on a plane  which is what one should do there  and this shape came out. This shape is of an extraordinary complication. The equation is hidden there  z goes into z squared  plus c. It's so simple  so dry. It's so uninteresting. Now you turn the crank once  twice  twice  marvels come out. I mean this comes out. I don't want to explain these things. This comes out. This comes out. Shapes which are of such complication  such harmony and such beauty. This comes out repeatedly  again  again  again. And that was one of my major discoveries  to find that these islands were the same as the whole big thing  more or less. And then you get these extraordinary baroque decorations all over the place. All that from this little formula  which has whatever  five symbols in it. And then this one. The color was added for two reasons. First of all  because these shapes are so complicated that one couldn't make any sense of the numbers. And if you plot them  you must choose some system. And so my principle has been to always present the shapes with different colorings because some colorings emphasize that  and others it is that or that. It's so complicated. In       I was in Cambridge  U.K. to receive a prize from the university  and three days later  a pilot was flying over the landscape and found this thing. So where did this come from  Obviously  from extraterrestrials. Well  so the newspaper in Cambridge published an article about that  discovery  and received the next day       letters from people saying   But that's simply a Mandelbrot set very big.  Well  let me finish. This shape here just came out of an exercise in pure mathematics. Bottomless wonders spring from simple rules  which are repeated without end. Thank you very much. I'm Ellen  and I'm totally obsessed with food. But I didn't start out obsessed with food. I started out obsessed with global security policy because I lived in New York during       and it was obviously a very relevant thing. And I got from global security policy to food because I realized when I'm hungry  I'm really pissed off  and I'm assuming that the rest of the world is too. Especially if you're hungry and your kids are hungry and your neighbor's kids are hungry and your whole neighborhood is hungry  you're pretty angry. And actually  lo and behold  it looks pretty much like the areas of the world that are hungry are also the areas of the world that are pretty insecure. So I took a job at the United Nations World Food Programme as a way to try to address these security issues through food security issues. And while I was there  I came across what I think is the most brilliant of their programs. It's called School Feeding  and it's a really simple idea to sort of get in the middle of the cycle of poverty and hunger that continues for a lot of people around the world  and stop it. By giving kids a free school meal  it gets them into school  which is obviously education  the first step out of poverty  but it also gives them the micronutrients and the macronutrients they need to really develop both mentally and physically. While I was working at the U.N.  I met this girl. Her name is Lauren Bush. And she had this really awesome idea to sell the bag called the  Feed Bag     which is really beautifully ironic because you can strap on the Feed Bag. But each bag we'd sell would provide a year's worth of school meals for one kid. It's so simple  and we thought  you know  okay  it costs between    and    bucks to provide school feeding for a year. We could sell these bags and raise a ton of money and a ton of awareness for the World Food Programme. But of course  you know at the U.N.  sometimes things move slowly  and they basically said no. And we thought  God  this is such a good idea and it's going to raise so much money. So we said screw it  we'll just start our own company  which we did three years ago. So that was kind of my first dream  was to start this company called FEED  and here's a screenshot of our website. We did this bag for Haiti  and we launched it just a month after the earthquake to provide school meals for kids in Haiti. So FEED's doing great. We've so far provided    million meals to kids around the world by selling now         bags  a ton of bags  a lot of bags. All this time you're    when you think about hunger  it's a hard thing to think about  because what we think about is eating. I think about eating a lot  and I really love it. And the thing that's a little strange about international hunger and talking about international issues is that most people kind of want to know   What are you doing in America    What are you doing for America's kids   There's definitely hunger in America     million people and almost   .  million children. I mean that's pretty dramatic for our own country. Hunger definitely means something a little bit different in America than it does internationally  but it's incredibly important to address hunger in our own country. But obviously the bigger problem that we all know about is obesity  and it's dramatic. The other thing that's dramatic is that both hunger and obesity have really risen in the last    years. Unfortunately  obesity's not only an American problem. It's actually been spreading all around the world and mainly through our kind of food systems that we're exporting. The numbers are pretty crazy. There's a billion people obese or overweight and a billion people hungry. So those seem like two bifurcated problems  but I kind of started to think about  you know  what is obesity and hunger  What are both those things about  Well  they're both about food. And when you think about food  the underpinning of food in both cases is potentially problematic agriculture. And agriculture is where food comes from. Well  agriculture in America's very interesting. It's very consolidated  and the foods that are produced lead to the foods that we eat. Well  the foods that are produced are  more or less  corn  soy and wheat. And as you can see  that's three quarters of the food that we're eating for the most part  processed foods and fast foods. Unfortunately  in our agricultural system  we haven't done a good job in the last three decades of exporting those technologies around the world. So African agriculture  which is the place of most hunger in the world  has actually fallen precipitously as hunger has risen. So somehow we're not making the connect between exporting a good agricultural system that will help feed people all around the world. Who is farming them  That's what I was wondering. So I went and stood on a big grain bin in the Midwest  and that really didn't help me understand farming  but I think it's a really cool picture. And you know  the reality is that between farmers in America  who actually  quite frankly  when I spend time in the Midwest  are pretty large in general. And their farms are also large. But farmers in the rest of the world are actually quite skinny  and that's because they're starving. Most hungry people in the world are subsistence farmers. And most of those people are women    which is a totally other topic that I won't get on right now  but I'd love to do the feminist thing at some point. I think it's really interesting to look at agriculture from these two sides. There's this large  consolidated farming that's led to what we eat in America  and it's really been since around       after the oil crisis  when  you know  mass consolidation  mass exodus of small farmers in this country. And then in the same time period  you know  we've kind of left Africa's farmers to do their own thing. Unfortunately  what is farmed ends up as what we eat. And in America  a lot of what we eat has led to obesity and has led to a real change in sort of what our diet is in the last    years. It's crazy. A fifth of kids under two drinks soda. Hello. You don't put soda in bottles. But people do because it's so cheap  and so our whole food system in the last    years has really shifted. I think  you know  it's not just in our own country  but really we're exporting the system around the world  and when you look at the data of least developed countries    especially in cities  which are growing really rapidly    people are eating American processed foods. And in one generation  they're going from hunger  and all of the detrimental health effects of hunger  to obesity and things like diabetes and heart disease in one generation. So the problematic food system is affecting both hunger and obesity. Not to beat a dead horse  but this is a global food system where there's a billion people hungry and billion people obese. I think that's the only way to look at it. And instead of taking these two things as bifurcated problems that are very separate  it's really important to look at them as one system. We get a lot of our food from all around the world  and people from all around the world are importing our food system  so it's incredibly relevant to start a new way of looking at it. The thing is  I've learned    and the technology people that are here  which I'm totally not one of them    but apparently  it really takes    years for a lot of technologies to become really endemic to us  like the mouse and the Internet and Windows. You know  there's    year cycles. I think      can be a really interesting year because it is the end of the    year cycle  and it's the birthday of the global food system. So that's the first birthday I want to talk about. You know  I think if we really think that this is something that's happened in the last    years  there's hope in that. It's the thirtieth anniversary of GMO crops and the Big Gulp  Chicken McNuggets  high fructose corn syrup  the farm crisis in America and the change in how we've addressed agriculture internationally. So there's a lot of reasons to take this    year time period as sort of the creation of this new food system. I'm not the only one who's obsessed with this whole    year thing. The icons like Michael Pollan and Jamie Oliver in his TED Prize wish both addressed this last three decade time period as incredibly relevant for food system change. Well  I really care about      because it's also the thirtieth anniversary of me this year. And so in my lifetime  a lot of what's happened in the world    and being a person obsessed with food    a lot of this has really changed. So my second dream is that I think we can look to the next    years as a time to change the food system again. And we know what's happened in the past  so if we start now  and we look at technologies and improvements to the food system long term  we might be able to recreate the food system so when I give my next talk and I'm    years old  I'll be able to say that it's been a success. So I'm announcing today the start of a new organization  or a new fund within the FEED Foundation  called the    Project. And the    Project is really focused on these long term ideas for food system change. And I think by aligning international advocates that are addressing hunger and domestic advocates that are addressing obesity  we might actually look for long term solutions that will make the food system better for everyone. We all tend to think that these systems are quite different  and people argue whether or not organic can feed the world  but if we take a    year view  there's more hope in collaborative ideas. So I'm hoping that by connecting really disparate organizations like the ONE campaign and Slow Food  which don't seem right now to have much in common  we can talk about holistic  long term  systemic solutions that will improve food for everyone. Some ideas I've had is like  look  the reality is    kids in the South Bronx need apples and carrots and so do kids in Botswana. And how are we going to get those kids those nutritious foods  Another thing that's become incredibly global is production of meat and fish. Understanding how to produce protein in a way that's healthy for the environment and healthy for people will be incredibly important to address things like climate change and how we use petrochemical fertilizers. And you know  these are really relevant topics that are long term and important for both people in Africa who are small farmers and people in America who are farmers and eaters. And I also think that thinking about processed foods in a new way  where we actually price the negative externalities like petrochemicals and like fertilizer runoff into the price of a bag of chips. Well  if that bag of chips then becomes inherently more expensive than an apple  then maybe it's time for a different sense of personal responsibility in food choice because the choices are actually choices instead of three quarters of the products being made just from corn  soy and wheat. The   Project.org is launched  and I've gathered a coalition of a few organizations to start. And it'll be growing over the next few months. But I really hope that you will all think of ways that you can look long term at things like the food system and make change. Trees epitomize stasis. Trees are rooted in the ground in one place for many human generations  but if we shift our perspective from the trunk to the twigs  trees become very dynamic entities  moving and growing. And I decided to explore this movement by turning trees into artists. I simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig. I waited for the wind to come up and held up a canvas  and that produced art. The piece of art you see on your left is painted by a western red cedar and that on your right by a Douglas fir  and what I learned was that different species have different signatures  like a Picasso versus a Monet. But I was also interested in the movement of trees and how this art might let me capture that and quantify it  so to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree    which produced this painting    moved in a single year  I simply measured and summed each of those lines. I multiplied them by the number of twigs per branch and the number of branches per tree and then divided that by the number of minutes per year. And so I was able to calculate how far a single tree moved in a single year. You might have a guess. The answer is actually         miles  or seven times around the globe. And so simply by shifting our perspective from a single trunk to the many dynamic twigs  we are able to see that trees are not simply static entities  but rather extremely dynamic. And I began to think about ways that we might consider this lesson of trees  to consider other entities that are also static and stuck  but which cry for change and dynamicism  and one of those entities is our prisons. Prisons  of course  are where people who break our laws are stuck  confined behind bars. And our prison system itself is stuck. The United States has over  .  million incarcerated men and women. That number is rising. Of the     incarcerated people that are released     will return to prison. Funds for education  for training and for rehabilitation are declining  so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues. I decided to ask whether the lesson I had learned from trees as artists could be applied to a static institution such as our prisons  and I think the answer is yes. In the year       I started a partnership with the Washington State Department of Corrections. Working with four prisons  we began bringing science and scientists  sustainability and conservation projects to four state prisons. We give science lectures  and the men here are choosing to come to our science lectures instead of watching television or weightlifting. That  I think  is movement. We partnered with the Nature Conservancy for inmates at Stafford Creek Correctional Center to grow endangered prairie plants for restoration of relic prairie areas in Washington state. That  I think  is movement. We worked with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife to grow endangered frogs    the Oregon spotted frog    for later release into protected wetlands. That  I think  is movement. And just recently  we've begun to work with those men who are segregated in what we call Supermax facilities. They've incurred violent infractions by becoming violent with guards and with other prisoners. They're kept in bare cells like this for    hours a day. When they have meetings with their review boards or mental health professionals  they're placed in immobile booths like this. For one hour a day they're brought to these bleak and bland exercise yards. Although we can't bring trees and prairie plants and frogs into these environments  we are bringing images of nature into these exercise yards  putting them on the walls  so at least they get contact with visual images of nature. This is Mr. Lopez  who has been in solitary confinement for    months  and he's providing input on the types of images that he believes would make him and his fellow inmates more serene  more calm  less apt to violence. And so what we see  I think  is that small  collective movements of change can perhaps move an entity such as our own prison system in a direction of hope. We know that trees are static entities when we look at their trunks. But if trees can create art  if they can encircle the globe seven times in one year  if prisoners can grow plants and raise frogs  then perhaps there are other static entities that we hold inside ourselves  like grief  like addictions  like racism  that can also change. Thank you very much. I still remember the day in school when our teacher told us that the world population had become three billion people  and that was in     . I'm going to talk now about how world population has changed from that year and into the future  but I will not use digital technology  as I've done during my first five TEDTalks. Instead  I have progressed  and I am  today  launching a brand new analog teaching technology that I picked up from IKEA  this box. This box contains one billion people. And our teacher told us that the industrialized world        had one billion people. In the developing world  she said  they had two billion people. And they lived away then. There was a big gap between the one billion in the industrialized world and the two billion in the developing world. In the industrialized world  people were healthy  educated  rich  and they had small families. And their aspiration was to buy a car. And in       all Swedes were saving to try to buy a Volvo like this. This was the economic level at which Sweden was. But in contrast to this  in the developing world  far away  the aspiration of the average family there was to have food for the day. They were saving to be able to buy a pair of shoes. There was an enormous gap in the world when I grew up. And this gap between the West and the rest has created a mindset of the world  which we still use linguistically when we talk about  the West  and  the Developing World.  But the world has changed  and it's overdue to upgrade that mindset and that taxonomy of the world  and to understand it. And that's what I'm going to show you  because since      what has happened in the world up to      is that a staggering four billion people have been added to the world population. Just look how many. The world population has doubled since I went to school. And of course  there's been economic growth in the West. A lot of companies have happened to grow the economy  so the Western population moved over to here. And now their aspiration is not only to have a car. Now they want to have a holiday on a very remote destination and they want to fly. So this is where they are today. And the most successful of the developing countries  they have moved on  you know  and they have become emerging economies  we call them. They are now buying cars. And what happened a month ago was that the Chinese company  Geely  they acquired the Volvo company  and then finally the Swedes understood that something big had happened in the world. So there they are. And the tragedy is that the two billion over here that is struggling for food and shoes  they are still almost as poor as they were    years ago. The new thing is that we have the biggest pile of billions  the three billions here  which are also becoming emerging economies  because they are quite healthy  relatively well educated  and they already also have two to three children per woman  as those  richer also  have. And their aspiration now is  of course  to buy a bicycle  and then later on they would like to have a motorbike also. But this is the world we have today  no longer any gap. But the distance from the poorest here  the very poorest  to the very richest over here is wider than ever. But there is a continuous world from walking  biking  driving  flying    there are people on all levels  and most people tend to be somewhere in the middle. This is the new world we have today in     . And what will happen in the future  Well  I'm going to project into     . I was in Shanghai recently  and I listened to what's happening in China  and it's pretty sure that they will catch up  just as Japan did. All the projections  say that  this one  billion  will  only  grow with one to two or three percent.  But this second  grows with seven  eight percent  and then they will end up here. They will start flying. And these lower or middle income countries  the emerging income countries  they will also forge forwards economically. And if  but only if  we invest in the right green technology    so that we can avoid severe climate change  and energy can still be relatively cheap    then they will move all the way up here. And they will start to buy electric cars. This is what we will find there. So what about the poorest two billion  What about the poorest two billion here  Will they move on  Well  here population  growth  comes in because there  among emerging economies  we already have two to three children per woman  family planning is widely used  and population growth is coming to an end. Here  among the poorest   population is growing. So these  poorest  two billion will  in the next decades  increase to three billion  and they will thereafter increase to four billion. There is nothing    but a nuclear war of a kind we've never seen    that can stop this  growth  from happening. Because we already have this  growth  in process. But if  and only if   the poorest  get out of poverty  they get education  they get improved child survival  they can buy a bicycle and a cell phone and come  to live  here  then population growth will stop in     . We cannot have people on this level looking for food and shoes because then we get continued population growth. And let me show you why by converting back to the old time digital technology. Here I have on the screen my country bubbles. Every bubble is a country. The size is population. The colors show the continent. The yellow on there is the Americas  dark blue is Africa  brown is Europe  green is the Middle East and this light blue is South Asia. That's India and this is China. Size is population. Here I have children per woman  two children  four children  six children  eight children    big families  small families. The year is     . And down here  child survival  the percentage of children surviving childhood up to starting school     percent     percent     percent      and almost     percent  as we have today in the wealthiest and healthiest countries. But look  this is the world my teacher talked about in       one billion Western world here    high child survival  small families    and all the rest  the rainbow of developing countries  with very large families and poor child survival. What has happened  I start the world. Here we go. Can you see  as the years pass by  child survival is increasing  They get soap  hygiene  education  vaccination  penicillin and then family planning. Family size is decreasing.  When  they get up to    percent child survival  then families decrease  and most of the Arab countries in the Middle East is falling down there  to small families . Look  Bangladesh catching up with India. The whole emerging world joins the Western world with good child survival and small family size  but we still have the poorest billion. Can you see the poorest billion  those  two  boxes I had over here  They are still up here. And they still have a child survival of only    to    percent  meaning that if you have six children born  there will be at least four who survive to the next generation. And the population will double in one generation. So the only way of really getting world population  growth  to stop is to continue to improve child survival to    percent. That's why investments by Gates Foundation  UNICEF and aid organizations  together with national government in the poorest countries  are so good  because they are actually helping us to reach a sustainable population size of the world. We can stop at nine billion if we do the right things. Child survival is the new green. It's only by child survival that we will stop population growth. And will it happen  Well  I'm not an optimist  neither am I a pessimist. I'm a very serious  possibilist.  It's a new category where we take emotion apart  and we just work analytically with the world. It can be done. We can have a much more just world. With green technology and with investments to alleviate poverty  and global governance  the world can become like this. And look at the position of the old West. Remember when this blue box was all alone  leading the world  living its own life. This will not happen  again . The role of the old West in the new world is to become the foundation of the modern world    nothing more  nothing less. But it's a very important role. Do it well and get used to it. Thank you very much. This is the ocean as I used to know it. And I find that since I've been in the Gulf a couple of times  I really kind of am traumatized because whenever I look at the ocean now  no matter where I am  even where I know none of the oil has gone  I sort of see slicks  and I'm finding that I'm very much haunted by it. But what I want to talk to you about today is a lot of things that try to put all of this in context  not just about the oil eruption  but what it means and why it has happened. First  just a little bit about me. I'm basically just a guy that likes to go fishing ever since I was a little kid  and because I did  I wound up studying sea birds to try to stay in the coastal habitats that I so loved. And now I mainly write books about how the ocean is changing  and the ocean is certainly changing very rapidly. Now we saw this kind of graphic earlier on  that we really live on a hard marble that has just a slight bit of wetness to it. It's like you dipped a marble in water. And the same thing with the atmosphere  If you took all the atmosphere and rolled it up in a ball  you would get that little sphere of gas on the right. So we live on the most fragile  little soap bubble you can imagine  a very sacred soap bubble  but one that is very  very easy to affect. And all the burning of oil and coal and gas  all the fossil fuels  have changed the atmosphere greatly. Carbon dioxide level has gone up and up and up. We're warming the climate. So the blowout in the Gulf is just a little piece of a much larger problem that we have with the energy that we use to run civilization. Beyond warming  we have the problem of the oceans getting more acidified    and already measurably so  and already affecting animals. Now in the laboratory  if you take a clam and you put it in the pH that is    not  .   which is the normal pH of seawater    but  .   it dissolves in about three days. If you take a sea urchin larva from  .   put it in a pH of  .     not a huge change    it becomes deformed and dies. And already  commercial oyster larvae are dying at large scales in some places. Coral reefs are growing slower in some places because of this problem. So this really matters. Now  let's take a little tour around the Gulf a little bit. One of the things that really impresses me about the people in the Gulf  They are really  really aquatic people. And they can handle water. They can handle a hurricane that comes and goes. When the water goes down  they know what to do. But when it's something other than water  and their water habitat changes  they don't have many options. In fact  those entire communities really don't have many options. They don't have another thing they can do. They can't go and work in the local hotel business because there isn't one in their community. If you go to the Gulf and you look around  you do see a lot of oil. You see a lot of oil on the ocean. You see a lot of oil on the shoreline. If you go to the site of the blowout  it looks pretty unbelievable. It looks like you just emptied the oil pan in your car  and you just dumped it in the ocean. And one of the really most incredible things  I think  is that there's nobody out there trying to collect it at the site where it is densest. Parts of the ocean there look just absolutely apocalyptic. You go in along the shore  you can find it everywhere. It's really messy. If you go to the places where it's just arriving  like the eastern part of the Gulf  in Alabama  there's still people using the beach while there are people cleaning up the beach. And they have a very strange way of cleaning up the beach. They're not allowed to put more than    pounds of sand in a    gallon plastic bag. They have thousands and thousands of plastic bags. I don't know what they're going to do with all that stuff. Meanwhile  there are still people trying to use the beach. They don't see the little  tiny sign that says   Stay out of the water.  Their kids are in the water  they're getting tar all over their clothes and their sandals. It's a mess. If you go to the place where the oil has been a while  it's an even bigger mess. And there's basically nobody there anymore  a few people trying to keep using it. You see people who are really shell shocked. They are very hardworking people. All they know about life is they get up in the morning  and if their engine starts  they go to work. They always felt that they could rely on the assurances that nature brought them through the ecosystem of the Gulf. They're finding that their world is really collapsing. And so you can see  literally  signs of their shock  signs of their outrage  signs of their anger  and signs of their grief. These are the things that you can see. There's a lot you can't see  also  underwater. What's going on underwater  Well  some people say there are oil plumes. Some people say there are not oil plumes. And Congressman Markey asks  you know   Is it going to take a submarine ride to see if there are really oil plumes   But I couldn't take a submarine ride    especially between the time I knew I was coming here and today    so I had to do a little experiment myself to see if there was oil in the Gulf of Mexico. So this is the Gulf of Mexico  sparkling place full of fish. I created a little oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. And I learned    in fact  I confirmed    the hypothesis that oil and water don't mix until you add a dispersant  and then they start mixing. And you add a little energy from the wind and the waves  and you get a big mess  a big mess that you can't possibly clean  you can't touch  you can't extract and  I think most importantly    this is what I think    you can't see it. I think it's being hidden on purpose. Now this is such a catastrophe and such a mess  that lots of stuff is leaking out on the edges of the information stream. But as many people have said  there's a large attempt to suppress what's going on. Personally  I think that the dispersants are a major strategy to hide the body  because we put the murderer in charge of the crime scene. But you can see it. You can see where the oil is concentrated at the surface  and then it is attacked  because they don't want the evidence  in my opinion. Okay. We heard that bacteria eat oil  So do sea turtles. When it breaks up  it has a long way to go before it gets down to bacteria. Turtles eat it. It gets in the gills of fish. These guys have to swim around through it. I heard the most incredible story today when I was on the train coming here. A writer named Ted Williams called me  and he was asking me a couple of questions about what I saw  because he's writing an article for Audubon magazine. He said that he had been in the Gulf a little while ago    like about a week ago    and a guy who had been a recreational fishing guide took him out to show him what's going on. That guide's entire calendar year is canceled bookings. He has no bookings left. Everybody wanted their deposit back. Everybody is fleeing. That's the story of thousands of people. But he told Ted that on the last day he went out  a bottlenose dolphin suddenly appeared next to the boat  and it was splattering oil out its blowhole. And he moved away because it was his last fishing trip  and he knew that the dolphins scare fish. So he moved away from it  turned around a few minutes later  it was right next to the side of the boat again. He said that in    years of fishing he had never seen a dolphin do that. And he felt that    he felt that it was coming to ask for help. Sorry. Now  in the Exxon Valdez spill  about    percent of the killer whales died in the first few months. Their numbers have never recovered. So the recovery rate of all this stuff is going to be variable. It's going to take longer for some things. And some things  I think  will probably come back a little faster. The other thing about the Gulf that is important is that there are a lot of animals that concentrate in the Gulf at certain parts of the year. So the Gulf is a really important piece of water    more important than a similar volume of water in the open Atlantic Ocean. These tuna swim the entire ocean. They get in the Gulf Stream. They go all the way to Europe. When it comes time to spawn  they come inside  and these two tuna that were tagged  you can see them on the spawning grounds very much right in the area of the slick. They're probably having  at the very least  a catastrophic spawning season this year. I'm hoping that maybe the adults are avoiding that dirty water. They don't usually like to go into water that is very cloudy anyway. But these are really high performance athletic animals. I don't know what this kind of stuff will do in their gills. I don't know if it'll affect the adults. If it's not  it's certainly affecting their eggs and larvae  I would certainly think. But if you look at that graph that goes down and down and down  that's what we've done to this species through overfishing over many decades. So while the oil spill  the leak  the eruption  is a catastrophe  I think it's important to keep in mind that we've done a lot to affect what's in the ocean for a very  very long time. It's not like we're starting with something that's been okay. We're starting with something that's had a lot of stresses and a lot of problems to begin with. If you look around at the birds  there are a lot of birds in the Gulf that concentrate in the Gulf at certain times of the year  but then leave. And they populate much larger areas. So for instance  most of the birds in this picture are migratory birds. They were all on the Gulf in May  while oil was starting to come ashore in certain places. Down on the lower left there are Ruddy Turnstones and Sanderlings. They breed in the high arctic  and they winter down in southern South America. But they concentrate in the Gulf and then fan out all across the arctic. I saw birds that breed in Greenland in the Gulf  so this is a hemispheric issue. The economic effects go at least nationally in many ways. The biological effects are certainly hemispheric. I think that this is one of the most absolutely mind boggling examples of total unpreparedness that I can even think of. Even when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor  at least they shot back. And we just seem to be unable to figure out what to do. There was nothing ready  and  you know  as we can see by what they're doing. Mainly what they're doing is booms and dispersants. The booms are absolutely not made for open water. They don't even attempt to corral the oil where it is most concentrated. They get near shore. Look at these two boats. That one on the right is called Fishing Fool. And I think  you know  that's a great name for boats that think that they're going to do anything to make a dent in this by dragging a boom between them when there are literally hundreds of thousands of square miles in the Gulf right now with oil at the surface. The dispersants make the oil go right under the booms. The booms are only about    inches in diameter. So it's just absolutely crazy. Here are shrimp boats employed. There are hundreds of shrimp boats employed to drag booms instead of nets. Here they are working. You can see easily that all the oily water just goes over the back of the boom. All they're doing is stirring it. It's just ridiculous. Also  for all the shoreline that has booms    hundreds and hundreds of miles of shoreline    all of the shoreline that has booms  there's adjacent shoreline that doesn't have any booms. There is ample opportunity for oil and dirty water to get in behind them. And that lower photo  that's a bird colony that has been boomed. Everybody's trying to protect the bird colonies there. Well  as an ornithologist  I can tell you that birds fly  and that    and that booming a bird colony doesn't do it  it doesn't do it. These birds make a living by diving into the water. In fact  really what I think they should do  if anything    they're trying so hard to protect those nests    actually  if they destroyed every single nest some of the birds would leave  and that would be better for them this year. As far as cleaning them  I don't mean to cast any aspersion on people cleaning birds. It's really  really important that we express our compassion. I think that's the most important thing that people have  is compassion. It's really important to get those images and to show it. But really  where are those birds going to get released to  It's like taking somebody out of a burning building  treating them for smoke inhalation and sending them back into the building  because the oil is still gushing. I refuse to acknowledge this as anything like an accident. I think that this is the result of gross negligence. Not just B.P. B.P. operated very sloppily and very recklessly because they could. And they were allowed to do so because of the absolute failure of oversight of the government that's supposed to be our government  protecting us. It turns out that    you see this sign on almost every commercial vessel in the United States    you know  if you spilled a couple of gallons of oil  you would be in big trouble. And you have to really wonder who are the laws made for  and who has gotten above the laws. Now there are things that we can do in the future. We could have the kinds of equipment that we would really need. It would not take an awful lot to anticipate that after making        holes in the sea floor of the Gulf of Mexico looking for oil  oil might start coming out of one of them. And you'd have some idea of what to do. That's certainly one of the things we need to do. But I think we have to understand where this leak really started from. It really started from the destruction of the idea that the government is there because it's our government  meant to protect the larger public interest. So I think that the oil blowout  the bank bailout  the mortgage crisis and all these things are absolutely symptoms of the same cause. We still seem to understand that at least we need the police to protect us from a few bad people. And even though the police can be a little annoying at times    giving us tickets and stuff like that    nobody says that we should just get rid of them. But in the entire rest of government right now and for the last at least    years  there has been a culture of deregulation that is caused directly by the people who we need to be protected from  buying the government out from under us. Now this has been a problem for a very  very long time. You can see that corporations were illegal at the founding of America  and even Thomas Jefferson complained that they were already bidding defiance to the laws of our country. Okay  people who say they're conservative  if they really wanted to be really conservative and really patriotic  they would tell these corporations to go to hell. That's what it would really mean to be conservative. So what we really need to do is regain the idea that it's our government safeguarding our interests and regain a sense of unity and common cause in our country that really has been lost. I think there are signs of hope. We seem to be waking up a little bit. The Glass Steagall Act    which was really to protect us from the kind of thing that caused the recession to happen  and the bank meltdown and all that stuff that required the bailouts    that was put in effect in       was systematically destroyed. Now there's a mood to put some of that stuff back in place  but the lobbyists are already there trying to weaken the regulations after the legislation has just passed. So it's a continued fight. It's a historic moment right now. We're either going to have an absolutely unmitigated catastrophe of this oil leak in the Gulf  or we will make the moment we need out of this  as many people have noted today. There's certainly a common theme about needing to make the moment out of this. We've been through this before with other ways of offshore drilling. The first offshore wells were called whales. The first offshore drills were called harpoons. We emptied the ocean of the whales at that time. Now are we stuck with this  Ever since we lived in caves  every time we wanted any energy  we lit something on fire  and that is still what we're doing. We're still lighting something on fire every time we want energy. And people say we can't have clean energy because it's too expensive. Who says it's too expensive  People who sell us fossil fuels. We've been here before with energy  and people saying the economy cannot withstand a switch  because the cheapest energy was slavery. Energy is always a moral issue. It's an issue that is moral right now. It's a matter of right and wrong. Thank you very much. When I was a student here in Oxford in the     s  the future of the world was bleak. The population explosion was unstoppable. Global famine was inevitable. A cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment was going to shorten our lives. The acid rain was falling on the forests. The desert was advancing by a mile or two a year. The oil was running out  and a nuclear winter would finish us off. None of those things happened  and astonishingly  if you look at what actually happened in my lifetime  the average per capita income of the average person on the planet  in real terms  adjusted for inflation  has tripled. Lifespan is up by    percent in my lifetime. Child mortality is down by two thirds. Per capita food production is up by a third. And all this at a time when the population has doubled. How did we achieve that  whether you think it's a good thing or not  How did we achieve that  How did we become the only species that becomes more prosperous as it becomes more populous  The size of the blob in this graph represents the size of the population  and the level of the graph represents GDP per capita. I think to answer that question you need to understand how human beings bring together their brains and enable their ideas to combine and recombine  to meet and  indeed  to mate. In other words  you need to understand how ideas have sex. I want you to imagine how we got from making objects like this to making objects like this. These are both real objects. One is an Acheulean hand axe from half a million years ago of the kind made by Homo erectus. The other is obviously a computer mouse. They're both exactly the same size and shape to an uncanny degree. I've tried to work out which is bigger  and it's almost impossible. And that's because they're both designed to fit the human hand. They're both technologies. In the end  their similarity is not that interesting. It just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand. The differences are what interest me  because the one on the left was made to a pretty unvarying design for about a million years    from one and a half million years ago to half a million years ago. Homo erectus made the same tool for        generations. Of course there were a few changes  but tools changed slower than skeletons in those days. There was no progress  no innovation. It's an extraordinary phenomenon  but it's true. Whereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years. And there's another difference too  which is the object on the left is made from one substance. The object on the right is made from a confection of different substances  from silicon and metal and plastic and so on. And more than that  it's a confection of different ideas  the idea of plastic  the idea of a laser  the idea of transistors. They've all been combined together in this technology. And it's this combination  this cumulative technology  that intrigues me  because I think it's the secret to understanding what's happening in the world. My body's an accumulation of ideas too  the idea of skin cells  the idea of brain cells  the idea of liver cells. They've come together. How does evolution do cumulative  combinatorial things  Well  it uses sexual reproduction. In an asexual species  if you get two different mutations in different creatures  a green one and a red one  then one has to be better than the other. One goes extinct for the other to survive. But if you have a sexual species  then it's possible for an individual to inherit both mutations from different lineages. So what sex does is it enables the individual to draw upon the genetic innovations of the whole species. It's not confined to its own lineage. What's the process that's having the same effect in cultural evolution as sex is having in biological evolution  And I think the answer is exchange  the habit of exchanging one thing for another. It's a unique human feature. No other animal does it. You can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange    and indeed there's reciprocity in other animals    But the exchange of one object for another never happens. As Adam Smith said   No man ever saw a dog make a fair exchange of a bone with another dog.  You can have culture without exchange. You can have  as it were  asexual culture. Chimpanzees  killer whales  these kinds of creatures  they have culture. They teach each other traditions which are handed down from parent to offspring. In this case  chimpanzees teaching each other how to crack nuts with rocks. But the difference is that these cultures never expand  never grow  never accumulate  never become combinatorial  and the reason is because there is no sex  as it were  there is no exchange of ideas. Chimpanzee troops have different cultures in different troops. There's no exchange of ideas between them. And why does exchange raise living standards  Well  the answer came from David Ricardo in     . And here is a Stone Age version of his story  although he told it in terms of trade between countries. Adam takes four hours to make a spear and three hours to make an axe. Oz takes one hour to make a spear and two hours to make an axe. So Oz is better at both spears and axes than Adam. He doesn't need Adam. He can make his own spears and axes. Well no  because if you think about it  if Oz makes two spears and Adam make two axes  and then they trade  then they will each have saved an hour of work. And the more they do this  the more true it's going to be  because the more they do this  the better Adam is going to get at making axes and the better Oz is going to get at making spears. So the gains from trade are only going to grow. And this is one of the beauties of exchange  is it actually creates the momentum for more specialization  which creates the momentum for more exchange and so on. Adam and Oz both saved an hour of time. That is prosperity  the saving of time in satisfying your needs. Ask yourself how long you would have to work to provide for yourself an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by. If you had to start from scratch  let's say you go out into the countryside. You find a sheep. You kill it. You get the fat out of it. You render it down. You make a candle  etc. etc. How long is it going to take you  Quite a long time. How long do you actually have to work to earn an hour of reading light if you're on the average wage in Britain today  And the answer is about half a second. Back in       you would have had to work for eight seconds on the average wage to acquire that much light. And that's seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you've gained since       as it were  because that's seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else  or you can acquire another good or service. And back in       it would have been    minutes to earn that amount of light on the average wage. Back in       you'd have had to work six hours to earn a candle that could burn for an hour. In other words  the average person on the average wage could not afford a candle in     . Go back to this image of the axe and the mouse  and ask yourself   Who made them and for who   The stone axe was made by someone for himself. It was self sufficiency. We call that poverty these days. But the object on the right was made for me by other people. How many other people  Tens  Hundreds  Thousands  You know  I think it's probably millions. Because you've got to include the man who grew the coffee  which was brewed for the man who was on the oil rig  who was drilling for oil  which was going to be made into the plastic  etc. They were all working for me  to make a mouse for me. And that's the way society works. That's what we've achieved as a species. In the old days  if you were rich  you literally had people working for you. That's how you got to be rich  you employed them. Louis XIV had a lot of people working for him. They made his silly outfits  like this  and they did his silly hairstyles  or whatever. He had     people to prepare his dinner every night. But a modern tourist going around the palace of Versailles and looking at Louis XIV's pictures  he has     people doing his dinner tonight too. They're in bistros and cafes and restaurants and shops all over Paris  and they're all ready to serve you at an hour's notice with an excellent meal that's probably got higher quality than Louis XIV even had. And that's what we've done  because we're all working for each other. We're able to draw upon specialization and exchange to raise each other's living standards. Now  you do get other animals working for each other too. Ants are a classic example  workers work for queens and queens work for workers. But there's a big difference  which is that it only happens within the colony. There's no working for each other across the colonies. And the reason for that is because there's a reproductive division of labor. That is to say  they specialize with respect to reproduction. The queen does it all. In our species  we don't like doing that. It's the one thing we insist on doing for ourselves  is reproduction. Even in England  we don't leave reproduction to the Queen. So when did this habit start  And how long has it been going on  And what does it mean  Well  I think  probably  the oldest version of this is probably the sexual division of labor. But I've got no evidence for that. It just looks like the first thing we did was work male for female and female for male. In all hunter gatherer societies today  there's a foraging division of labor between  on the whole  hunting males and gathering females. It isn't always quite that simple  but there's a distinction between specialized roles for males and females. And the beauty of this system is that it benefits both sides. The woman knows that  in the Hadzas' case here    digging roots to share with men in exchange for meat    she knows that all she has to do to get access to protein is to dig some extra roots and trade them for meat. And she doesn't have to go on an exhausting hunt and try and kill a warthog. And the man knows that he doesn't have to do any digging to get roots. All he has to do is make sure that when he kills a warthog it's big enough to share some. And so both sides raise each other's standards of living through the sexual division of labor. When did this happen  We don't know  but it's possible that Neanderthals didn't do this. They were a highly cooperative species. They were a highly intelligent species. Their brains on average  by the end  were bigger than yours and mine in this room today. They were imaginative. They buried their dead. They had language  probably  because we know they had the FOXP  gene of the same kind as us  which was discovered here in Oxford. And so it looks like they probably had linguistic skills. They were brilliant people. I'm not dissing the Neanderthals. But there's no evidence of a sexual division of labor. There's no evidence of gathering behavior by females. It looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men. And the other thing there's no evidence for is exchange between groups  because the objects that you find in Neanderthal remains  the tools they made  are always made from local materials. For example  in the Caucasus there's a site where you find local Neanderthal tools. They're always made from local chert. In the same valley there are modern human remains from about the same date         years ago  and some of those are from local chert  but more    but many of them are made from obsidian from a long way away. And when human beings began moving objects around like this  it was evidence that they were exchanging between groups. Trade is    times as old as farming. People forget that. People think of trade as a modern thing. Exchange between groups has been going on for a hundred thousand years. And the earliest evidence for it crops up somewhere between    and         years ago in Africa  when you see obsidian and jasper and other things moving long distances in Ethiopia. You also see seashells    as discovered by a team here in Oxford    moving     miles inland from the Mediterranean in Algeria. And that's evidence that people have started exchanging between groups. And that will have led to specialization. How do you know that long distance movement means trade rather than migration  Well  you look at modern hunter gatherers like aboriginals  who quarried for stone axes at a place called Mount Isa  which was a quarry owned by the Kalkadoon tribe. They traded them with their neighbors for things like stingray barbs  and the consequence was that stone axes ended up over a large part of Australia. So long distance movement of tools is a sign of trade  not migration. What happens when you cut people off from exchange  from the ability to exchange and specialize  And the answer is that not only do you slow down technological progress  you can actually throw it into reverse. An example is Tasmania. When the sea level rose and Tasmania became an island        years ago  the people on it not only experienced slower progress than people on the mainland  they actually experienced regress. They gave up the ability to make stone tools and fishing equipment and clothing because the population of about       people was simply not large enough to maintain the specialized skills necessary to keep the technology they had. It's as if the people in this room were plonked on a desert island. How many of the things in our pockets could we continue to make after        years  It didn't happen in Tierra del Fuego    similar island  similar people. The reason  because Tierra del Fuego is separated from South America by a much narrower straight  and there was trading contact across that straight throughout        years. The Tasmanians were isolated. Go back to this image again and ask yourself  not only who made it and for who  but who knew how to make it. In the case of the stone axe  the man who made it knew how to make it. But who knows how to make a computer mouse  Nobody  literally nobody. There is nobody on the planet who knows how to make a computer mouse. I mean this quite seriously. The president of the computer mouse company doesn't know. He just knows how to run a company. The person on the assembly line doesn't know because he doesn't know how to drill an oil well to get oil out to make plastic  and so on. We all know little bits  but none of us knows the whole. I am of course quoting from a famous essay by Leonard Read  the economist in the     s  called  I  Pencil  in which he wrote about how a pencil came to be made  and how nobody knows even how to make a pencil  because the people who assemble it don't know how to mine graphite  and they don't know how to fell trees and that kind of thing. And what we've done in human society  through exchange and specialization  is we've created the ability to do things that we don't even understand. It's not the same with language. With language we have to transfer ideas that we understand with each other. But with technology  we can actually do things that are beyond our capabilities. We've gone beyond the capacity of the human mind to an extraordinary degree. And by the way  that's one of the reasons that I'm not interested in the debate about I.Q.  about whether some groups have higher I.Q.s than other groups. It's completely irrelevant. What's relevant to a society is how well people are communicating their ideas  and how well they're cooperating  not how clever the individuals are. So we've created something called the collective brain. We're just the nodes in the network. We're the neurons in this brain. It's the interchange of ideas  the meeting and mating of ideas between them  that is causing technological progress  incrementally  bit by bit. However  bad things happen. And in the future  as we go forward  we will  of course  experience terrible things. There will be wars  there will be depressions  there will be natural disasters. Awful things will happen in this century  I'm absolutely sure. But I'm also sure that  because of the connections people are making  and the ability of ideas to meet and to mate as never before  I'm also sure that technology will advance  and therefore living standards will advance. Because through the cloud  through crowd sourcing  through the bottom up world that we've created  where not just the elites but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them meet and mate  we are surely accelerating the rate of innovation. Thank you. I'm an American  which means  generally  I ignore football unless it involves guys my size or Bruno's size running into each other at extremely high speeds. That said  it's been really hard to ignore football for the last couple of weeks. I go onto Twitter  there are all these strange words that I've never heard before  FIFA  vuvuzela  weird jokes about octopi. But the one that's really been sort of stressing me out  that I haven't been able to figure out  is this phrase  Cala a boca  Galvao.  If you've gone onto Twitter in the last couple of weeks  you've probably seen this. It's been a major trending topic. Being a monolingual American  I obviously don't know what the phrase means. So I went onto Twitter  and I asked some people if they could explain to me  Cala a boca  Galvao.  And fortunately  my Brazilian friends were more than ready to help. They explained that the Galvao bird is a rare and endangered parrot that's in terrible  terrible danger. In fact  I'll let them tell you a bit more about it. Narrator  A word about Galvao  a very rare kind of bird native to Brazil. Every year  more than         Galvao birds are killed during Carnival parades. Ethan Zuckerman  Obviously  this is a tragic situation  and it actually gets worse. It turns out that  not only is the Galvao parrot very attractive  useful for headdresses  it evidently has certain hallucinogenic properties  which means that there's a terrible problem with Galvao abuse. Some sick and twisted people have found themselves snorting Galvao. And it's terribly endangered. The good news about this is that the global community    again  my Brazilian friends tell me    is pitching in to help out. It turns out that Lady Gaga has released a new single    actually five or six new singles  as near as I can tell    titled  Cala a boca  Galvao.  And my Brazilian friends tell me that if I just tweet the phrase  Cala a boca  Galvao      cents will be given to a global campaign to save this rare and beautiful bird. Now  most of you have figured out that this was a prank  and actually a very  very good one.  Cala a boca  Galvao  actually means something very different. In Portugese  it means  Shut your mouth  Galvao.  And it specifically refers to this guy  Galvao Bueno  who's the lead soccer commentator for Rede Globo. And what I understand from my Brazilian friends is that this guy is just a cliche machine. He can ruin the most interesting match by just spouting cliche again and again and again. So Brazilians went to that first match against North Korea  put up this banner  started a Twitter campaign and tried to convince the rest of us to tweet the phrase   Cala a boca  Galvao.  And in fact  were so successful at this that it topped Twitter for two weeks. Now there's a couple    there's a couple of lessons that you can take from this. And the first lesson  which I think is a worthwhile one  is that you cannot go wrong asking people to be active online  so long as activism just means retweeting a phrase. So as long as activism is that simple  it's pretty easy to get away with. The other thing you can take from this  by the way  is that there are a lot of Brazilians on Twitter. There's more than five million of them. As far as national representation     percent of Brazilian internet users are on Twitter. That's a much higher number than in the U.S. or U.K. Next to Japan  it's the second most represented by population. Now if you're using Twitter or other social networks  and you didn't realize this was a space with a lot of Brazilians in it  you're like most of us. Because what happens on a social network is you interact with the people that you have chosen to interact with. And if you are like me  a big  geeky  white  American guy  you tend to interact with a lot of other geeky  white  American guys. And you don't necessarily have the sense that Twitter is in fact a very heavily Brazilian space. It's also extremely surprising to many Americans  a heavily African American space. Twitter recently did some research. They looked at their local population. They believe that    percent of American Twitter users are African American. That's about twice as high as African Americans are represented in the population. And again  that was very shocking to many Twitter users  but it shouldn't be. And the reason it shouldn't be is that on any day you can go into Trending Topics. And you tend to find topics that are almost entirely African American conversations. This was a visualization done by Fernando Viegas and Martin Wattenberg  two amazing visualization designers  who looked at a weekend's worth of Twitter traffic and essentially found that a lot of these trending topics were basically segregated conversations    and in ways that you wouldn't expect. It turns out that oil spill is a mostly white conversation  that cookout is a mostly black conversation. And what's crazy about this is that if you wanted to mix up who you were seeing on Twitter  it's literally a quick click away. You click on that cookout tag  there an entirely different conversation with different people participating in it. But generally speaking  most of us don't. We end up within these filter bubbles  as my friend Eli Pariser calls them  where we see the people we already know and the people who are similar to the people we already know. And we tend not to see that wider picture. Now for me  I'm surprised by this  because this wasn't how the internet was supposed to be. If you go back into the early days of the internet  when cyber utopians like Nick Negroponte were writing big books like  Being Digital   the prediction was that the internet was going to be an incredibly powerful force to smooth out cultural differences  to put us all on a common field of one fashion or another. Negroponte started his book with a story about how hard it is to build connections in the world of atoms. He's at a technology conference in Florida. And he's looking at something really  truly absurd  which is bottles of Evian water on the table. And Negroponte says this is crazy. This is the old economy. It's the economy of moving these heavy  slow atoms over long distances that's very difficult to do. We're heading to the future of bits  where everything is speedy  it's weightless. It can be anywhere in the world at any time. And it's going to change the world as we know it. Now  Negroponte has been right about a lot of things. He's totally wrong about this one. It turns out that in many cases atoms are much more mobile than bits. If I walk into a store in the United States  it's very  very easy for me to buy water that's bottled in Fiji  shipped at great expense to the United States. It's actually surprisingly hard for me to see a Fijian feature film. It's really difficult for me to listen to Fijian music. It's extremely difficult for me to get Fijian news  which is strange  because actually there's an enormous amount going on in Fiji. There's a coup government. There's a military government. There's crackdowns on the press. It's actually a place that we probably should be paying attention to at the moment. Here's what I think is going on. I think that we tend to look a lot at the infrastructure of globalization. We look at the framework that makes it possible to live in this connected world. And that's a framework that includes things like airline routes. It includes things like the Internet cables. We look at a map like this one  and it looks like the entire world is flat because everything is a hop or two away. You can get on a flight in London  you can end up in Bangalore later today. Two hops  you're in Suva  the capitol of Fiji. It's all right there. When you start looking at what actually flows on top of these networks  you get a very different picture. You start looking at how the global plane flights move  and you suddenly discover that the world isn't even close to flat. It's extremely lumpy. There are parts of the world that are very  very well connected. There's basically a giant pathway in the sky between London and New York. but look at this map  and you can watch this for  you know  two or three minutes. You won't see very many planes go from South America to Africa. And you'll discover that there are parts of the globe that are systematically cut off. When we stop looking at the infrastructure that makes connection possible  and we look at what actually happens  we start realizing that the world doesn't work quite the same way that we think it does. So here's the problem that I've been interested in in the last decade or so. The world is  in fact  getting more global. It's getting more connected. More of problems are global in scale. More of our economics is global in scale. And our media is less global by the day. If you watched a television broadcast in the United States in the     s     to    percent of it would have been international news on a nightly new broadcast. That's down to about    to    percent. And this tends to give us a very distorted view of the world. Here's a slide that Alisa Miller showed at a previous TED Talk. Alisa's the president of Public Radio International. And she made a cartogram  which is basically a distorted map based on what American television news casts looked at for a month. And you see that when you distort a map based on attention  the world within American television news is basically reduced to this giant bloated U.S. and a couple of other countries which we've invaded. And that's basically what our media is about. And before you conclude that this is just a function of American TV news    which is dreadful  and I agree that it's dreadful    I've been mapping elite media like the New York Times  and I get the same thing. When you look at the New York Times  you look at other elite media  what you largely get are pictures of very wealthy nations and the nations we've invaded. It turns out that new media isn't necessarily helping us all that much. Here's a map made by Mark Graham who's down the street at the Oxford Internet Institute. A this is a map of articles in Wikipedia that have been geo coded. And you'll notice that there's a very heavy bias towards North America and Western Europe. Even within Wikipedias  where we're creating their own content online  there's a heavy bias towards the place where a lot of the Wikipedia authors are based  rather than to the rest of the world. In the U.K.  you can get up  you can pick up your computer when you get out of this session  you could read a newspaper from India or from Australia  from Canada  God forbid from the U.S. You probably won't. If you look at online media consumption    in this case  in the top    users of the internet    more than    percent of the news readership is on domestic news sites. It's one of these rare cases where the U.S. is actually slightly better than  the U.K.   because we actually like reading your media  rather than vice versa. So all of this starts leading me to think that we're in a state that I refer to as imaginary cosmopolitanism. We look at the internet. We think we're getting this wide view of the globe. We occasionally stumble onto a page in Chinese  and we decide that we do in fact have the greatest technology ever built to connect us to the rest of the world. And we forget that most of the time we're checking Boston Red Sox scores. So this is a real problem    not just because the Red Sox are having a bad year    but it's a real problem because  as we're discussing here at TED  the real problems in the world the interesting problems to solve are global in scale and scope  they require global conversations to get to global solutions. This is a problem we have to solve. So here's the good news. For six years  I've been hanging out with these guys. This is a group called Global Voices. This is a team of bloggers from around the world. Our mission was to fix the world's media. We started in     . You might have noticed  we haven't done all that well so far. Nor do I think we are by ourselves  actually going to solve the problem. But the more that I think about it  the more that I think that a few things that we have learned along the way are interesting lessons for how we would rewire if we we wanted to use the web to have a wider world. The first thing you have to consider is that there are parts of the world that are dark spots in terms of attention. In this case    the map of the world at night by NASA    they're dark literally because of lack of electricity. And I used to think that a dark spot on this map basically meant you're not going to get media from there because there are more basic needs. What I'm starting to realize is that you can get media  it's just an enormous amount of work  and you need an enormous amount of encouragement. One of those dark spots is Madagascar  a country which is generally better known for the Dreamworks film than it is actually known for the lovely people who live there. And so the people who founded Foko Club in Madagascar weren't actually concerned with trying to change the image of their country. They were doing something much simpler. It was a club to learn English and to learn computers and the internet. but what happened was that Madagascar went through a violent coup. Most independent media was shut down. And the high school students who were learning to blog through Foko Club suddenly found themselves talking to an international audience about the demonstrations  the violence  everything that was going on within this country. So a very  very small program designed to get people in front of computers  publishing their own thoughts  publishing independent media  ended up having a huge impact on what we know about this country. Now the trick with this is that I'm guessing most people here don't speak Malagasy. I'm also guessing that most of you don't even speak Chinese    which is sort of sad if you think about it  as it's now the most represented language on the internet. Fortunately people are trying to figure out how to fix this. If you're using Google Chrome and you go to a Chinese language site  you notice this really cute box at the top  which automatically detects that the page is in Chinese and very quickly at a mouse click will give you a translation of the page. Unfortunately  it's a machine translation of the page. And while Google is very  very good with some languages  it's actually pretty dreadful with Chinese. And the results can be pretty funny. What you really want    what I really want  is eventually the ability to push a button and have this queued so a human being can translate this. And if you think this is absurd  it's not. There's a group right now in China called Yeeyan. And Yeeyan is a group of         volunteers who get online every day. They look for the most interesting content in the English language. They translate roughly     articles a day from major newspapers  major websites. They put it online for free. It's the project of a guy named Zhang Lei  who was living in the United States during the Lhasa riots and who couldn't believe how biased American media coverage was. And he said   If there's one thing I can do  I can start translating  so that people between these countries start understanding each other a little bit better.  And my question to you is  if Yeeyan can line up         people to translate the English internet into Chinese  where's the English language Yeeyan  Who's going after Chinese  which now has     million internet users out there  My guess is at least one of them has something interesting to say. So even if we can find a way to translate from Chinese  there's no guarantee that we're going to find it. When we look for information online  we basically have two strategies. We use a lot of search. And search is terrific if you know what you're looking for. But if what you're looking for is serendipity  if you want to stumble onto something that you didn't know you needed  our main philosophy is to look to our social networks  to look for our friends. What are they looking at  Maybe we should be looking at it. The problem with this is that essentially what you end up getting after a while is the wisdom of the flock. You end up flocking with a lot of people who are probably similar to you  who have similar interests. And it's very  very hard to get information from the other flocks  from the other parts of the world where people getting together and talking about their own interests. To do this  at a certain point  you need someone to bump you out of your flock and into another flock. You need a guide. So this is Amira Al Hussaini. She is the Middle East editor for Global Voices. She has one of the hardest jobs in the world. Not only does she have to keep our Israeli and Palestinian contributors from killing each other  she has to figure out what is going to interest you about the Middle East. And in that sense of trying to get you out of your normal orbit  and to try to get you to pay attention to a story about someone who's given up smoking for the month of Ramadan  she has to know something about a global audience. She has to know something about what stories are available. Basically  she's a deejay. She's a skilled human curator who knows what material is available to her  who's able to listen to the audience  and who's able to make a selection and push people forward in one fashion or another. I don't think this is necessarily an algorithmic process. I think what's great about the internet is that it actually makes it much easier for deejays to reach a wider audience. I know Amira. I can ask her what to read. But with the internet  she's in a position where she can tell a lot of people what to read. And you can listen to her as well  if this is a way that you're interested in having your web widened. So once you start widening like this  once you start lighting up voices in the dark spots  once you start translating  once you start curating  you end up in some really weird places. This is an image from pretty much my favorite blog  which is AfriGadget. And AfriGadget is a blog that looks at technology in an Africa context. And specifically  it's looking at a blacksmith in Kibera in Nairobi  who is turning the shaft of a Landrover into a cold chisel. And when you look at this image  you might find yourself going   Why would I conceivably care about this   And the truth is  this guy can probably explain this to you. This is Erik Hersman. You guys may have seen him around the conference. He goes by the moniker White African. He's both a very well known American geek  but he's also Kenyan  he was born in Sudan  grew up in Kenya. He is a bridge figure. He is someone who literally has feet in both worlds    one in the world of the African technology community  one in the world of the American technology community. And so he's able to tell a story about this blacksmith in Kibera and turn it into a story about repurposing technology  about innovating from constraint  about looking for inspiration based on reusing materials. He knows one world  and he's finding a way to communicate it to another world  both of which he has deep connections to. These bridge figures  I'm pretty well convinced  are the future of how we try to make the world wider through using the web. But the trick with bridges is  ultimately  you need someone to cross them. And that's where we start talking about xenophiles. So if I found myself in the NFL  I suspect I would spend my off season nursing my wounds  enjoying my house  so on and so forth    possibly recording a hip hop album. Dhani Jones  who is the middle linebacker for the Cincinnati Bengals  has a slightly different approach to the off season. Dhani has a television show. It's called  Dhani Tackles the Globe.  And every week on this television show  Dhani travels to a different nation of the world. He finds a local sporting team. He trains with them for a week  and he plays a match with them. And his reason for this is not just that he wants to master Muay Thai boxing. It's because  for him  sport is the language that allows him to encounter the full width and wonder of the world. For some of us it might be music. For some of us it might be food. For a lot of us it might be literature or writing. But there are all these different techniques that allow you to go out and look at the world and find your place within it. The goal of my Talk here is not to persuade the people in this room to embrace your xenophilia. My guess    given that you're at a conference called TEDGlobal    is that most of you are xenophiles  whether or not you use that term. My challenge instead is this. It's not enough to make the personal decision that you want a wider world. We have to figure out how to rewire the systems that we have. We have to fix our media. We have to fix the internet. We have to fix our education. We have to fix our immigration policy. We need to look at ways of creating serendipity  of making translation pervasive  and we need to find ways to embrace and celebrate these bridge figures. And we need to figure out how to cultivate xenophiles. That's what I'm trying to do. I need your help. I'm a storyteller. That's what I do in life    telling stories  writing novels    and today I would like to tell you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also some supernatural creatures called the djinni. But before I go there  please allow me to share with you glimpses of my personal story. I will do so with the help of words  of course  but also a geometrical shape  the circle  so throughout my talk  you will come across several circles. I was born in Strasbourg  France to Turkish parents. Shortly after  my parents got separated  and I came to Turkey with my mom. From then on  I was raised as a single child by a single mother. Now in the early     s  in Ankara  that was a bit unusual. Our neighborhood was full of large families  where fathers were the heads of households  so I grew up seeing my mother as a divorcee in a patriarchal environment. In fact  I grew up observing two different kinds of womanhood. On the one hand was my mother  a well educated  secular  modern  westernized  Turkish woman. On the other hand was my grandmother  who also took care of me and was more spiritual  less educated and definitely less rational. This was a woman who read coffee grounds to see the future and melted lead into mysterious shapes to fend off the evil eye. Many people visited my grandmother  people with severe acne on their faces or warts on their hands. Each time  my grandmother would utter some words in Arabic  take a red apple and stab it with as many rose thorns as the number of warts she wanted to remove. Then one by one  she would encircle these thorns with dark ink. A week later  the patient would come back for a follow up examination. Now  I'm aware that I should not be saying such things in front of an audience of scholars and scientists  but the truth is  of all the people who visited my grandmother for their skin conditions  I did not see anyone go back unhappy or unhealed. I asked her how she did this. Was it the power of praying  In response she said   Yes  praying is effective  but also beware of the power of circles.  From her  I learned  amongst many other things  one very precious lesson    that if you want to destroy something in this life  be it an acne  a blemish or the human soul  all you need to do is to surround it with thick walls. It will dry up inside. Now we all live in some kind of a social and cultural circle. We all do. We're born into a certain family  nation  class. But if we have no connection whatsoever with the worlds beyond the one we take for granted  then we too run the risk of drying up inside. Our imagination might shrink  our hearts might dwindle  and our humanness might wither if we stay for too long inside our cultural cocoons. Our friends  neighbors  colleagues  family    if all the people in our inner circle resemble us  it means we are surrounded with our mirror image. Now one other thing women like my grandma do in Turkey is to cover mirrors with velvet or to hang them on the walls with their backs facing out. It's an old Eastern tradition based on the knowledge that it's not healthy for a human being to spend too much time staring at his own reflection. Ironically   living in  communities of the like minded is one of the greatest dangers of today's globalized world. And it's happening everywhere  among liberals and conservatives  agnostics and believers  the rich and the poor  East and West alike. We tend to form clusters based on similarity  and then we produce stereotypes about other clusters of people. In my opinion  one way of transcending these cultural ghettos is through the art of storytelling. Stories cannot demolish frontiers  but they can punch holes in our mental walls. And through those holes  we can get a glimpse of the other  and sometimes even like what we see. I started writing fiction at the age of eight. My mother came home one day with a turquoise notebook and asked me if I'd be interested in keeping a personal journal. In retrospect  I think she was slightly worried about my sanity. I was constantly telling stories at home  which was good  except I told this to imaginary friends around me  which was not so good. I was an introverted child  to the point of communicating with colored crayons and apologizing to objects when I bumped into them  so my mother thought it might do me good to write down my day to day experiences and emotions. What she didn't know was that I thought my life was terribly boring  and the last thing I wanted to do was to write about myself. Instead  I began to write about people other than me and things that never really happened. And thus began my life long passion for writing fiction. So from the very beginning  fiction for me was less of an autobiographical manifestation than a transcendental journey into other lives  other possibilities. And please bear with me  I'll draw a circle and come back to this point. Now one other thing happened around this same time. My mother became a diplomat. So from this small  superstitious  middle class neighborhood of my grandmother  I was zoomed into this posh  international school  in Madrid   where I was the only Turk. It was here that I had my first encounter with what I call the  representative foreigner.  In our classroom  there were children from all nationalities  yet this diversity did not necessarily lead to a cosmopolitan  egalitarian classroom democracy. Instead  it generated an atmosphere in which each child was seen    not as an individual on his own  but as the representative of something larger. We were like a miniature United Nations  which was fun  except whenever something negative  with regards to a nation or a religion  took place. The child who represented it was mocked  ridiculed and bullied endlessly. And I should know  because during the time I attended that school  a military takeover happened in my country  a gunman of my nationality nearly killed the Pope  and Turkey got zero points in  the  Eurovision Song Contest. I skipped school often and dreamed of becoming a sailor during those days. I also had my first taste of cultural stereotypes there. The other children asked me about the movie  Midnight Express   which I had not seen  they inquired how many cigarettes a day I smoked  because they thought all Turks were heavy smokers  and they wondered at what age I would start covering my hair. I came to learn that these were the three main stereotypes about my country  politics  cigarettes and the veil. After Spain  we went to Jordan  Germany and Ankara again. Everywhere I went  I felt like my imagination was the only suitcase I could take with me. Stories gave me a sense of center  continuity and coherence  the three big Cs that I otherwise lacked. In my mid twenties  I moved to Istanbul  the city I adore. I lived in a very vibrant  diverse neighborhood where I wrote several of my novels. I was in Istanbul when the earthquake hit in     . When I ran out of the building at three in the morning  I saw something that stopped me in my tracks. There was the local grocer there    a grumpy  old man who didn't sell alcohol and didn't speak to marginals. He was sitting next to a transvestite with a long black wig and mascara running down her cheeks. I watched the man open a pack of cigarettes with trembling hands and offer one to her  and that is the image of the night of the earthquake in my mind today    a conservative grocer and a crying transvestite smoking together on the sidewalk. In the face of death and destruction  our mundane differences evaporated  and we all became one even if for a few hours. But I've always believed that stories  too  have a similar effect on us. I'm not saying that fiction has the magnitude of an earthquake  but when we are reading a good novel  we leave our small  cozy apartments behind  go out into the night alone and start getting to know people we had never met before and perhaps had even been biased against. Shortly after  I went to a women's college in Boston  then Michigan. I experienced this  not so much as a geographical shift  as a linguistic one. I started writing fiction in English. I'm not an immigrant  refugee or exile    they ask me why I do this    but the commute between languages gives me the chance to recreate myself. I love writing in Turkish  which to me is very poetic and very emotional  and I love writing in English  which to me is very mathematical and cerebral. So I feel connected to each language in a different way. For me  like millions of other people around the world today  English is an acquired language. When you're a latecomer to a language  what happens is you live there with a continuous and perpetual frustration. As latecomers  we always want to say more  you know  crack better jokes  say better things  but we end up saying less because there's a gap between the mind and the tongue. And that gap is very intimidating. But if we manage not to be frightened by it  it's also stimulating. And this is what I discovered in Boston    that frustration was very stimulating. At this stage  my grandmother  who had been watching the course of my life with increasing anxiety  started to include in her daily prayers that I urgently get married so that I could settle down once and for all. And because God loves her  I did get married. But instead of settling down  I went to Arizona. And since my husband is in Istanbul  I started commuting between Arizona and Istanbul    the two places on the surface of earth that couldn't be more different. I guess one part of me has always been a nomad  physically and spiritually. Stories accompany me  keeping my pieces and memories together  like an existential glue. Yet as much as I love stories  recently  I've also begun to think that they lose their magic if and when a story is seen as more than a story. And this is a subject that I would love to think about together. When my first novel written in English came out in America  I heard an interesting remark from a literary critic.  I liked your book   he said   but I wish you had written it differently.  I asked him what he meant by that. He said   Well  look at it. There's so many Spanish  American  Hispanic characters in it  but there's only one Turkish character and it's a man.  Now the novel took place on a university campus in Boston  so to me  it was normal that there be more international characters in it than Turkish characters  but I understood what my critic was looking for. And I also understood that I would keep disappointing him. He wanted to see the manifestation of my identity. He was looking for a Turkish woman in the book because I happened to be one. We often talk about how stories change the world  but we should also see how the world of identity politics affects the way stories are being circulated  read and reviewed. Many authors feel this pressure  but non Western authors feel it more heavily. If you're a woman writer from the Muslim world  like me  then you are expected to write the stories of Muslim women and  preferably  the unhappy stories of unhappy Muslim women. You're expected to write informative  poignant and characteristic stories and leave the experimental and avant garde to your Western colleagues. What I experienced as a child in that school in Madrid is happening in the literary world today. Writers are not seen as creative individuals on their own  but as the representatives of their respective cultures  a few authors from China  a few from Turkey  a few from Nigeria. We're all thought to have something very distinctive  if not peculiar. The writer and commuter James Baldwin gave an interview in      in which he was repeatedly asked about his homosexuality. When the interviewer tried to pigeonhole him as a gay writer  Baldwin stopped and said   But don't you see  There's nothing in me that is not in everybody else  and nothing in everybody else that is not in me.  When identity politics tries to put labels on us  it is our freedom of imagination that is in danger. There's a fuzzy category called multicultural literature in which all authors from outside the Western world are lumped together. I never forget my first multicultural reading  in Harvard Square about    years ago. We were three writers  one from the Philippines  one Turkish and one Indonesian    like a joke  you know. And the reason why we were brought together was not because we shared an artistic style or a literary taste. It was only because of our passports. Multicultural writers are expected to tell real stories  not so much the imaginary. A function is attributed to fiction. In this way  not only the writers themselves  but also their fictional characters become the representatives of something larger. But I must quickly add that this tendency to see a story as more than a story does not solely come from the West. It comes from everywhere. And I experienced this firsthand when I was put on trial in      for the words my fictional characters uttered in a novel. I had intended to write a constructive  multi layered novel about an Armenian and a Turkish family through the eyes of women. My micro story became a macro issue when I was prosecuted. Some people criticized  others praised me for writing about the Turkish Armenian conflict. But there were times when I wanted to remind both sides that this was fiction. It was just a story. And when I say   just a story   I'm not trying to belittle my work. I want to love and celebrate fiction for what it is  not as a means to an end. Writers are entitled to their political opinions  and there are good political novels out there  but the language of fiction is not the language of daily politics. Chekhov said   The solution to a problem and the correct way of posing the question are two completely separate things. And only the latter is an artist's responsibility.  Identity politics divides us. Fiction connects. One is interested in sweeping generalizations. The other  in nuances. One draws boundaries. The other recognizes no frontiers. Identity politics is made of solid bricks. Fiction is flowing water. In the Ottoman times  there were itinerant storytellers called  meddah.  They would go to coffee houses  where they would tell a story in front of an audience  often improvising. With each new person in the story  the meddah would change his voice  impersonating that character. Everybody could go and listen  you know    ordinary people  even the sultan  Muslims and non Muslims. Stories cut across all boundaries  like  The Tales of Nasreddin Hodja   which were very popular throughout the Middle East  North Africa  the Balkans and Asia. Today  stories continue to transcend borders. When Palestinian and Israeli politicians talk  they usually don't listen to each other  but a Palestinian reader still reads a novel by a Jewish author  and vice versa  connecting and empathizing with the narrator. Literature has to take us beyond. If it cannot take us there  it is not good literature. Books have saved the introverted  timid child that I was    that I once was. But I'm also aware of the danger of fetishizing them. When the poet and mystic  Rumi  met his spiritual companion  Shams of Tabriz  one of the first things the latter did was to toss Rumi's books into water and watch the letters dissolve. The Sufis say   Knowledge that takes you not beyond yourself is far worse than ignorance.  The problem with today's cultural ghettos is not lack of knowledge    we know a lot about each other  or so we think    but knowledge that takes us not beyond ourselves  it makes us elitist  distant and disconnected. There's a metaphor which I love  living like a drawing compass. As you know  one leg of the compass is static  rooted in a place. Meanwhile  the other leg draws a wide circle  constantly moving. Like that  my fiction as well. One part of it is rooted in Istanbul  with strong Turkish roots  but the other part travels the world  connecting to different cultures. In that sense  I like to think of my fiction as both local and universal  both from here and everywhere. Now those of you who have been to Istanbul have probably seen Topkapi Palace  which was the residence of Ottoman sultans for more than     years. In the palace  just outside the quarters of the favorite concubines  there's an area called The Gathering Place of the Djinn. It's between buildings. I'm intrigued by this concept. We usually distrust those areas that fall in between things. We see them as the domain of supernatural creatures like the djinn  who are made of smokeless fire and are the symbol of elusiveness. But my point is perhaps that elusive space is what writers and artists need most. When I write fiction I cherish elusiveness and changeability. I like not knowing what will happen    pages later. I like it when my characters surprise me. I might write about a Muslim woman in one novel  and perhaps it will be a very happy story  and in my next book  I might write about a handsome  gay professor in Norway. As long as it comes from our hearts  we can write about anything and everything. Audre Lorde once said   The white fathers taught us to say  'I think  therefore I am.'  She suggested   I feel  therefore I am free.  I think it was a wonderful paradigm shift. And yet  why is it that  in creative writing courses today  the very first thing we teach students is  write what you know   Perhaps that's not the right way to start at all. Imaginative literature is not necessarily about writing who we are or what we know or what our identity is about. We should teach young people and ourselves to expand our hearts and write what we can feel. We should get out of our cultural ghetto and go visit the next one and the next. In the end  stories move like whirling dervishes  drawing circles beyond circles. They connect all humanity  regardless of identity politics  and that is the good news. And I would like to finish with an old Sufi poem   Come  let us be friends for once  let us make life easy on us  let us be lovers and loved ones  the earth shall be left to no one.  Thank you. Chris Anderson  Julian  welcome. It's been reported that WikiLeaks  your baby  has  in the last few years has released more classified documents than the rest of the world's media combined. Can that possibly be true  Julian Assange  Yeah  can it possibly be true  It's a worry    isn't it     that the rest of the world's media is doing such a bad job that a little group of activists is able to release more of that type of information than the rest of the world press combined. CA  How does it work  How do people release the documents  And how do you secure their privacy  JA  So these are    as far as we can tell    classical whistleblowers  and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us. So we use this state of the art encryption to bounce stuff around the Internet  to hide trails  pass it through legal jurisdictions like Sweden and Belgium to enact those legal protections. We get information in the mail  the regular postal mail  encrypted or not  vet it like a regular news organization  format it    which is sometimes something that's quite hard to do  when you're talking about giant databases of information    release it to the public and then defend ourselves against the inevitable legal and political attacks. CA  So you make an effort to ensure the documents are legitimate  but you actually almost never know who the identity of the source is  JA  That's right  yeah. Very rarely do we ever know  and if we find out at some stage then we destroy that information as soon as possible. CA  I think that's the CIA asking what the code is for a TED membership. So let's take  an  example  actually. This is something you leaked a few years ago. If we can have this document up ... So this was a story in Kenya a few years ago. Can you tell us what you leaked and what happened  JA  So this is the Kroll Report. This was a secret intelligence report commissioned by the Kenyan government after its election in     . Prior to       Kenya was ruled by Daniel arap Moi for about    years. He was a soft dictator of Kenya. And when Kibaki got into power    through a coalition of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in Kenya    they commissioned this report  spent about two million pounds on this and an associated report. And then the government sat on it and used it for political leverage on Moi  who was the richest man    still is the richest man    in Kenya. It's the Holy Grail of Kenyan journalism. So I went there in       and we managed to get hold of this just prior to the election    the national election  December   . When we released that report  we did so three days after the new president  Kibaki  had decided to pal up with the man that he was going to clean out  Daniel arap Moi  so this report then became a dead albatross around President Kibaki's neck. CA  And    I mean  to cut a long story short    word of the report leaked into Kenya  not from the official media  but indirectly  and in your opinion  it actually shifted the election. JA  Yeah. So this became front page of the Guardian and was then printed in all the surrounding countries of Kenya  in Tanzanian and South African press. And so it came in from the outside. And that  after a couple of days  made the Kenyan press feel safe to talk about it. And it ran for    nights straight on Kenyan TV  shifted the vote by    percent  according to a Kenyan intelligence report  which changed the result of the election. CA  Wow  so your leak really substantially changed the world  JA  Yep. CA  Here's    We're going to just show a short clip from this Baghdad airstrike video. The video itself is longer  but here's a short clip. This is    this is intense material  I should warn you. Radio  ... just fuckin'  once you get on 'em just open 'em up. I see your element  uh  got about four Humvees  uh  out along ... You're clear. All right. Firing. Let me know when you've got them. Let's shoot. Light 'em all up. C'mon  fire  Keep shoot 'n. Keep shoot 'n. Keep shoot 'n. Hotel ... Bushmaster Two Six  Bushmaster Two Six  we need to move  time now  All right  we just engaged all eight individuals. Yeah  we see two birds  helicopters   and we're still firing. Roger. I got 'em. Two Six  this is Two Six  we're mobile. Oops  I'm sorry. What was going on  God damn it  Kyle. All right  hahaha. I hit 'em. CA  So  what was the impact of that  JA  The impact on the people who worked on it was severe. We ended up sending two people to Baghdad to further research that story. So this is just the first of three attacks that occurred in that scene. CA  So  I mean     people died in that attack  right  including two Reuters employees  JA  Yeah. Two Reuters employees  two young children were wounded. There were between    and    people killed all together. CA  And releasing this caused widespread outrage. What was the key element of this that actually caused the outrage  do you think  JA  I don't know. I guess people can see the gross disparity in force. You have guys walking in a relaxed way down the street  and then an Apache helicopter sitting up at one kilometer firing    millimeter cannon shells on everyone    looking for any excuse to do so    and killing people rescuing the wounded. And there was two journalists involved that clearly weren't insurgents because that's their full time job. CA  I mean  there's been this U.S. intelligence analyst  Bradley Manning  arrested  and it's alleged that he confessed in a chat room to have leaked this video to you  along with         classified U.S. embassy cables. I mean  did he  JA  We have denied receiving those cables. He has been charged  about five days ago  with obtaining         cables and releasing   . Now  we had released  early in the year  a cable from the Reykjavik U.S. embassy  but this is not necessarily connected. I mean  I was a known visitor of that embassy. CA  I mean  if you did receive thousands of U.S. embassy diplomatic cables ... JA  We would have released them.  CA  You would   JA  Yeah.  CA  Because   JA  Well  because these sort of things reveal what the true state of  say  Arab governments are like  the true human rights abuses in those governments. If you look at declassified cables  that's the sort of material that's there. CA  So let's talk a little more broadly about this. I mean  in general  what's your philosophy  Why is it right to encourage leaking of secret information  JA  Well  there's a question as to what sort of information is important in the world  what sort of information can achieve reform. And there's a lot of information. So information that organizations are spending economic effort into concealing  that's a really good signal that when the information gets out  there's a hope of it doing some good    because the organizations that know it best  that know it from the inside out  are spending work to conceal it. And that's what we've found in practice  and that's what the history of journalism is. CA  But are there risks with that  either to the individuals concerned or indeed to society at large  where leaking can actually have an unintended consequence  JA  Not that we have seen with anything we have released. I mean  we have a harm immunization policy. We have a way of dealing with information that has sort of personal    personally identifying information in it. But there are legitimate secrets    you know  your records with your doctor  that's a legitimate secret    but we deal with whistleblowers that are coming forward that are really sort of well motivated. CA  So they are well motivated. And what would you say to  for example  the  you know  the parent of someone whose son is out serving the U.S. military  and he says   You know what  you've put up something that someone had an incentive to put out. It shows a U.S. soldier laughing at people dying. That gives the impression  has given the impression  to millions of people around the world that U.S. soldiers are inhuman people. Actually  they're not. My son isn't. How dare you   What would you say to that  JA  Yeah  we do get a lot of that. But remember  the people in Baghdad  the people in Iraq  the people in Afghanistan    they don't need to see the video  they see it every day. So it's not going to change their opinion. It's not going to change their perception. That's what they see every day. It will change the perception and opinion of the people who are paying for it all  and that's our hope. CA  So you found a way to shine light into what you see as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government. Light is good. But do you see any irony in the fact that  in order for you to shine that light  you have to  yourself  create secrecy around your sources  JA  Not really. I mean  we don't have any WikiLeaks dissidents yet. We don't have sources who are dissidents on other sources. Should they come forward  that would be a tricky situation for us  but we're presumably acting in such a way that people feel morally compelled to continue our mission  not to screw it up. CA  I'd actually be interested  just based on what we've heard so far    I'm curious as to the opinion in the TED audience. You know  there might be a couple of views of WikiLeaks and of Julian. You know  hero    people's hero    bringing this important light. Dangerous troublemaker. Who's got the hero view  Who's got the dangerous troublemaker view  JA  Oh  come on. There must be some. CA  It's a soft crowd  Julian  a soft crowd. We have to try better. Let's show them another example. Now here's something that you haven't yet leaked  but I think for TED you are. I mean it's an intriguing story that's just happened  right  What is this  JA  So this is a sample of what we do sort of every day. So late last year    in November last year    there was a series of well blowouts in Albania  like the well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico  but not quite as big. And we got a report    a sort of engineering analysis into what happened    saying that  in fact  security guards from some rival  various competing oil firms had  in fact  parked trucks there and blown them up. And part of the Albanian government was in this  etc.  etc. And the engineering report had nothing on the top of it  so it was an extremely difficult document for us. We couldn't verify it because we didn't know who wrote it and knew what it was about. So we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up. So under that basis  we put it out and said   Look  we're skeptical about this thing. We don't know  but what can we do  The material looks good  it feels right  but we just can't verify it.  And we then got a letter just this week from the company who wrote it  wanting to track down the source    saying   Hey  we want to track down the source.  And we were like   Oh  tell us more. What document is it  precisely  you're talking about  Can you show that you had legal authority over that document  Is it really yours   So they sent us this screen shot with the author in the Microsoft Word ID. Yeah. That's happened quite a lot though. This is like one of our methods of identifying  of verifying  what a material is  is to try and get these guys to write letters. CA  Yeah. Have you had information from inside BP  JA  Yeah  we have a lot  but I mean  at the moment  we are undergoing a sort of serious fundraising and engineering effort. So our publication rate over the past few months has been sort of minimized while we're re engineering our back systems for the phenomenal public interest that we have. That's a problem. I mean  like any sort of growing startup organization  we are sort of overwhelmed by our growth  and that means we're getting enormous quantity of whistleblower disclosures of a very high caliber but don't have enough people to actually process and vet this information. CA  So that's the key bottleneck  basically journalistic volunteers and or the funding of journalistic salaries  JA  Yep. Yeah  and trusted people. I mean  we're an organization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with  so we have to restructure in order to have people who will deal with the highest national security stuff  and then lower security cases. CA  So help us understand a bit about you personally and how you came to do this. And I think I read that as a kid you went to    different schools. Can that be right  JA  Well  my parents were in the movie business and then on the run from a cult  so the combination between the two ... CA  I mean  a psychologist might say that's a recipe for breeding paranoia. JA  What  the movie business  CA  And you were also    I mean  you were also a hacker at an early age and ran into the authorities early on. JA  Well  I was a journalist. You know  I was a very young journalist activist at an early age. I wrote a magazine  was prosecuted for it when I was a teenager. So you have to be careful with hacker. I mean there's like    there's a method that can be deployed for various things. Unfortunately  at the moment  it's mostly deployed by the Russian mafia in order to steal your grandmother's bank accounts. So this phrase is not  not as nice as it used to be. CA  Yeah  well  I certainly don't think you're stealing anyone's grandmother's bank account  but what about your core values  Can you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some incident in your life that helped determine them  JA  I'm not sure about the incident. But the core values  well  capable  generous men do not create victims  they nurture victims. And that's something from my father and something from other capable  generous men that have been in my life. CA  Capable  generous men do not create victims  they nurture victims  JA  Yeah. And you know  I'm a combative person  so I'm not actually so big on the nurture  but some way    there is another way of nurturing victims  which is to police perpetrators of crime. And so that is something that has been in my character for a long time. CA  So just tell us  very quickly in the last minute  the story  what happened in Iceland  You basically published something there  ran into trouble with a bank  then the news service there was injuncted from running the story. Instead  they publicized your side. That made you very high profile in Iceland. What happened next  JA  Yeah  this is a great case  you know. Iceland went through this financial crisis. It was the hardest hit of any country in the world. Its banking sector was    times the GDP of the rest of the economy. Anyway  so we release this report in July last year. And the national TV station was injuncted five minutes before it went on air  like out of a movie  injunction landed on the news desk  and the news reader was like   This has never happened before. What do we do   Well  we just show the website instead  for all that time  as a filler  and we became very famous in Iceland  went to Iceland and spoke about this issue. And there was a feeling in the community that that should never happen again  and as a result  working with Icelandic politicians and some other international legal experts  we put together a new sort of package of legislation for Iceland to sort of become an offshore haven for the free press  with the strongest journalistic protections in the world  with a new Nobel Prize for freedom of speech. Iceland's a Nordic country  so  like Norway  it's able to tap into the system. And just a month ago  this was passed by the Icelandic parliament unanimously. CA  Wow. Last question  Julian. When you think of the future then  do you think it's more likely to be Big Brother exerting more control  more secrecy  or us watching Big Brother  or it's just all to be played for either way  JA  I'm not sure which way it's going to go. I mean  there's enormous pressures to harmonize freedom of speech legislation and transparency legislation around the world    within the E.U.  between China and the United States. Which way is it going to go  It's hard to see. That's why it's a very interesting time to be in    because with just a little bit of effort  we can shift it one way or the other. CA  Well  it looks like I'm reflecting the audience's opinion to say  Julian  be careful  and all power to you. JA  Thank you  Chris.  CA  Thank you.  In October       the Justice League of America will be teaming up with The   . Icons like Batman  Superman  Wonder Woman and their colleagues will be teaming up with icons Jabbar  Noora  Jami and their colleagues. It's a story of intercultural intersections  and what better group to have this conversation than those that grew out of fighting fascism in their respective histories and geographies  As fascism took over Europe in the     s  an unlikely reaction came out of North America. As Christian iconography got changed  and swastikas were created out of crucifixes  Batman and Superman were created by Jewish young men in the United States and Canada  also going back to the Bible. Consider this  like the prophets  all the superheroes are missing parents. Superman's parents die on Krypton before the age of one. Bruce Wayne  who becomes Batman  loses his parents at the age of six in Gotham City. Spiderman is raised by his aunt and uncle. And all of them  just like the prophets who get their message from God through Gabriel  get their message from above. Peter Parker is in a library in Manhattan when the spider descends from above and gives him his message through a bite. Bruce Wayne is in his bedroom when a big bat flies over his head  and he sees it as an omen to become Batman. Superman is not only sent to Earth from the heavens  or Krypton  but he's sent in a pod  much like Moses was on the Nile. And you hear the voice of his father  Jor El  saying to Earth   I have sent to you my only son.  These are clearly biblical archetypes  and the thinking behind that was to create positive  globally resonating storylines that could be tied to the same things that other people were pulling mean messages out of because then the person that's using religion for the wrong purpose just becomes a bad man with a bad message. And it's only by linking positive things that the negative can be delinked. This is the kind of thinking that went into creating The   . The    references the    attributes of Allah in the Koran  things like generosity and mercy and foresight and wisdom and dozens of others that no two people in the world would disagree about. It doesn't matter what your religion is  even if you're an atheist  you don't raise your kid telling him  you know   Make sure you lie three times a day.  Those are basic human values. And so the backstory of The    takes place in       which history tells us the Mongols invaded Baghdad and destroyed it. All the books from Bait al Hikma library  the most famous library in its day  were thrown in the Tigris River  and the Tigris changes color with ink. It's a story passed on generation after generation. I rewrote that story  and in my version  the librarians find out that this is going to happen    and here's a side note  if you want a comic book to do well  make the librarians the hero. It always works well. So the librarians find out and they get together a special solution  a chemical solution called King's Water  that when mixed with    stones would be able to save all that culture and history in the books. But the Mongols get there first. The books and the solution get thrown in the Tigris River. Some librarians escape  and over the course of days and weeks  they dip the stones into the Tigris and suck up that collective wisdom that we all think is lost to civilization. Those stones have been smuggled as three prayer beads of    stones each through Arabia into Andalusia in Spain  where they're safe for     years. But in       two important things happen. The first is the fall of Granada  the last Muslim enclave in Europe. The second is Columbus finally gets funded to go to India  but he gets lost. So    of the stones are smuggled onto the Nina  the Pinta and the Santa Maria and are spread in the New World. Thirty three go on the Silk Road to China  South Asia and Southeast Asia. And    are spread between Europe  the Middle East and Africa. And now it's       and there are    heroes from    different countries. Now it's very easy to assume that those books  because they were from a library called Bait al Hikma  were Muslim books  but that's not the case because the caliph that built that library  his name was al Ma'mun    he was Harun al Rashid's son. He had told his advisers   Get me all the scholars to translate any book they can get their hands onto into Arabic  and I will pay them its weight in gold.  After a while  his advisers complained. They said   Your Highness  the scholars are cheating. They're writing in big handwriting to take more gold.  To which he said   Let them be  because what they're giving us is worth a lot more than what we're paying them.  So the idea of an open architecture  an open knowledge  is not new to my neck of the desert. The concept centers on something called the Noor stones. Noor is Arabic for light. So these    stones  a few kind of rules in the game  Number one  you don't choose the stone  the stone chooses you. There's a King Arthur element to the storyline  okay. Number two  all of The     when they first get their stone  or their power  abuse it  they use it for self interest. And there's a very strong message in there that when you start abusing your stone  you get taken advantage of by people who will exploit your powers  okay. Number three  the    stones all have within them a mechanism that self updates. Now there are two groups that exist within the Muslim world. Everybody believes the Koran is for all time and all place. Some believe that means that the original interpretation from a couple thousand years ago is what's relevant today. I don't belong there. Then there's a group that believes the Koran is a living  breathing document  and I captured that idea within these stones that self update. Now the main bad guy  Rughal  does not want these stones to update  so he's trying to get them to stop updating. He can't use the stones  but he can stop them. And by stopping them  he has more of a fascist agenda  where he gets some of The    to work for him    they're all wearing cookie cutter  same color uniforms They're not allowed to individually express who they are and what they are. And he controls them from the top down    whereas when they work for the other side  eventually  when they find out this is the wrong person  they've been manipulated  they actually  each one has a different  colorful kind of dress. And the last point about the    Noor stones is this. So The    work in teams of three. Why three  A couple of reasons. Number one  we have a thing within Islam that you don't leave a boy and a girl alone together  because the third person is temptation or the devil  right  I think that's there in all cultures  right  But this is not about religion  it's not about proselytizing. There's this very strong social message that needs to get to kind of the deepest crevices of intolerance  and the only way to get there is to kind of play the game. And so this is the way I dealt with it. They work in teams of three  two boys and a girl  two girls and a boy  three boys  three girls  no problem. And the Swiss psychoanalyst  Carl Jung  also spoke about the importance of the number three in all cultures  so I figure I'm covered. Well ... I got accused in a few blogs that I was actually sent by the Pope to preach the Trinity and Catholicism in the Middle East  so you     Laughter  you believe who you want. I gave you my version of the story. So here's some of the characters that we have. Mujiba  from Malaysia  her main power is she's able to answer any question. She's the Trivial Pursuit queen  if you want  but when she first gets her power  she starts going on game shows and making money. We have Jabbar from Saudi who starts breaking things when he has the power. Now  Mumita was a fun one to name. Mumita is the destroyer. So the    attributes of Allah have the yin and the yang  there's the powerful  the hegemonous  the strong  and there's also the kind  the generous. I'm like  are all the girls going to be kind and merciful and the guys all strong  I'm like  you know what  I've met a few girls who were destroyers in my lifetime  so ... We have Jami from Hungary  who first starts making weapons  He's the technology wiz. Musawwira from Ghana  Hadya from Pakistan  Jaleel from Iran who uses fire. And this is one of my favorites  Al Batina from Yemen. Al Batina is the hidden. So Al Batina is hidden  but she's a superhero. I came home to my wife and I said   I created a character after you.  My wife is a Saudi from Yemeni roots. And she said   Show me.  So I showed this. She said   That's not me.  I said   Look at the eyes. They're your eyes.  So I promised my investors this would not be another made in fifth world country production. This was going to be Superman  or it wasn't worth my time or their money. So from day one  the people involved in the project  bottom left is Fabian Nicieza  writer for X Men and Power Rangers. Next to him is Dan Panosian  one of the character creators for the modern day X Men. Top right is Stuart Moore  a writer for Iron Man. Next to him is John McCrea  who was an inker for Spiderman. And we entered Western consciousness with a tagline   Next Ramadan  the world will have new heroes   back in     . Now I went to Dubai  to an Arab Thought Foundation Conference  and I was waiting by the coffee for the right journalist. Didn't have a product  but had energy. And I found somebody from The New York Times  and I cornered him  and I pitched him. And I think I scared him     Laughter  because he basically promised me    we had no product    but he said   We'll give you a paragraph in the arts section if you'll just go away.  So I said   Great.  So I called him up a few weeks afterward. I said   Hi  Hesa.  And he said   Hi.  I said   Happy New Year.  He said   Thank you. We had a baby.  I said   Congratulations.  Like I care  right   So when's the article coming out   He said   Naif  Islam and cartoon  That's not timely. You know  maybe next week  next month  next year  but  you know  it'll come out.  So a few days after that  what happens  What happens is the world erupts in the Danish cartoon controversy. I became timely. So flurry of phone calls and emails from The New York Times. Next thing you knew  there's a full page covering us positively  January   nd        which changed our lives forever  because anybody Googling Islam and cartoon or Islam and comic  guess what they got  they got me. And The    were like superheroes kind of flying out of what was happening around the world. And that led to all kinds of things  from being in curricula in universities and schools to    one of my favorite pictures I have from South Asia  it was a couple of men with long beards and a lot of girls wearing the hijab    it looked like a school. The good news is they're all holding copies of The     smiling  and they found me to sign the picture. The bad news is they were all photocopies  so we didn't make a dime in revenue. We've been able to license The    comic books into eight languages so far    Chinese  Indonesian  Hindi  Urdu  Turkish. Opened a theme park through a license in Kuwait a year and a half ago called The    Village Theme Park            square feet     rides  all with our characters  a couple back to school licenses in Spain and Turkey. But the biggest thing we've done to date  which is just amazing  is that we've done a    episode animated series  which is done for global audiences  in fact  we're already going to be in the U.S. and Turkey  we know. It's  D CGI  which is going to be very high quality  written in Hollywood by the writers behind Ben    and Spiderman and Star Wars  Clone Wars. In this clip I'm about to show you  which has never been seen in the public before  there is a struggle. Two of the characters  Jabbar  the one with the muscles  and Noora  the one that can use light  are actually wearing the cookie cutter fascist gray uniform because they're being manipulated. They don't know  OK  and they're trying to get another member of The    to join them. So there's a struggle within the team. So if we can get the lights ...   The      Jabbar  Dana  I can't see where to grab hold. I need more light. What's happening  Dana  There's too much darkness. Rughal  There must be something we can do. Man  I won't send any more commandos in until I know it's safe. Dr. Razem  It's time to go  Miklos. Miklos  Must download file contents. I can't forget auntie. Jabbar  Dana  I can't do this without you. Dana  But I can't help. Jabbar  You can  even if you don't believe in yourself right now. I believe in you. You are Noora the Light. Dana  No. I don't deserve it. I don't deserve anything. Jabbar  Then what about the rest of us  Don't we deserve to be saved  Don't I  Now  tell me which way to go. Dana  That way. Alarm  Threat imminent. Jabbar  Aaaahhh  Miklos  Stay away from me. Jabbar  We're here to help you. Dr. Razem  Don't listen to them. Dana  Miklos  that man is not your friend. Miklos  No. He gave me access  and you want to reboot the  unclear . No more  unclear .   The      Thank you. So  The     is technology  it's entertainment  it's design. But that's only half the story. As the father of five sons  I worry about who they're going to be using as role models. I worry because all around me  even within my extended family  I see religion being manipulated. As a psychologist  I worry for the world in general  but worry about the perception of how people see themselves in my part of the world. Now  I'm a clinical psychologist. I'm licensed in New York State. I trained at Bellevue Hospital Survivors of Political Torture Program  and I heard one too many stories of people growing up to idolize their leadership  only to end up being tortured by their heroes. And torture's a terrible enough thing as it is  but when it's done by your hero  that just breaks you in so many ways. I left Bellevue  went to business school and started this. Now  one of the things that I refer to when I    about the importance of this message    is that I gave a lecture at the medical school at Kuwait University  where I lecture on the biological basis of behavior  and I gave the students two articles  one from The New York Times and one from New York magazine. And I took away the name of the writer  the name of the  unclear     everything was gone except the facts. And the first one was about a group called The Party of God  who wanted to ban Valentine's Day. Red was made illegal. Any boys and girls caught flirting would get married off immediately  okay. The second one was about a woman complaining because three minivans with six bearded men pulled up and started interrogating her on the spot for talking to a man who wasn't related to her. And I asked the students in Kuwait where they thought these incidents took place. The first one  they said Saudi Arabia. There was no debate. The second one  they were actually split between Saudi and Afghanistan. What blew their mind was the first one took place in India  it was the party of a Hindu God. The second one took place in upstate New York. It was an Orthodox Jewish community. But what breaks my heart and what's alarming is that in those two interviews  the people around  who were interviewed as well  refer to that behavior as Talibanization. In other words  good Hindus and good Jews don't act this way. This is Islam's influence on Hinduism and Judaism. But what do the students in Kuwait say  They said it's us    and this is dangerous. It's dangerous when a group self identifies itself as extreme. This is one of my sons  Rayan  who's a Scooby Doo addict. You can tell by the glasses there. He actually called me a meddling kid the other day. But I borrow a lesson that I learned from him. Last summer when we were in our home in New York  he was out in the yard playing in his playhouse. And I was in my office working  and he came in   Baba  I want you to come with me. I want my toy.   Yes  Rayan  just go away.  He left his Scooby Doo in his house. I said   Go away. I'm working. I'm busy.  And what Rayan did then is he sat there  he tapped his foot on the floor  at three and a half  and he looked at me and he said   Baba  I want you to come with me to my office in my house. I have work to do.  Rayan reframed the situation and brought himself down to my level. And with The     that is what we aim to do. You know  I think that there's a big parallel between bending the crucifix out of shape and creating swastikas. And when I see pictures like this  of parents or uncles who think it's cute to have a little child holding a Koran and having a suicide bomber belt around them to protest something  the hope is by linking enough positive things to the Koran  that one day we can move this child from being proud in the way they're proud there  to that. And I think    I think The    can and will achieve its mission. As an undergrad at Tufts University  we were giving away free falafel one day and  you know  it was Middle East Day or something. And people came up and picked up the culturally resonant image of the falafel  ate it and  you know  talked and left. And no two people could disagree about what the word free was and what the word falafel was  behind us   free falafel.  You know. Or so we thought  until a woman came rushing across the campus and dropped her bag on the floor  pointed up to the sign and said   Who's falafel   True story. She was actually coming out of an Amnesty International meeting. Just today  D.C. Comics announced the cover of our upcoming crossover. On that cover you see Batman  Superman and a fully clothed Wonder Woman with our Saudi member of The     our Emirati member and our Libyan member. On April           President Barack Obama said that of all the initiatives since his now famous Cairo speech    in which he reached out to the Muslim world    the most innovative was that The    reach back out to the Justice League of America. We live in a world in which the most culturally innocuous symbols  like the falafel  can be misunderstood because of baggage  and where religion can be twisted and purposefully made where it's not supposed to be by others. In a world like that  they'll always be a job for Superman and The   . Thank you very much. Well  indeed  I'm very  very lucky. My talk essentially got written by three historic events that happened within days of each other in the last two months    seemingly unrelated  but as you will see  actually all having to do with the story I want to tell you today. The first one was actually a funeral    to be more precise  a reburial. On May   nd  there was a hero's reburial in Frombork  Poland of the   th century astronomer who actually changed the world. He did that  literally  by replacing the Earth with the Sun in the center of the Solar System  and then with this simple looking act  he actually launched a scientific and technological revolution  which many call the Copernican Revolution. Now that was  ironically  and very befittingly  the way we found his grave. As it was the custom of the time  Copernicus was actually simply buried in an unmarked grave  together with    others in that cathedral. DNA analysis  one of the hallmarks of the scientific revolution of the last     years that he started  was the way we found which set of bones actually belonged to the person who read all those astronomical books which were filled with leftover hair that was Copernicus' hair    obviously not many other people bothered to read these books later on. That match was unambiguous. The DNA matched  and we know that this was indeed Nicolaus Copernicus. Now  the connection between biology and DNA and life is very tantalizing when you talk about Copernicus because  even back then  his followers very quickly made the logical step to ask  if the Earth is just a planet  then what about planets around other stars  What about the idea of the plurality of the worlds  about life on other planets  In fact  I'm borrowing here from one of those very popular books of the time. And at the time  people actually answered that question positively   Yes.  But there was no evidence. And here begins     years of frustration  of unfulfilled dreams    the dreams of Galileo  Giordano Bruno  many others    which never led to the answer of those very basic questions which humanity has asked all the time.  What is life  What is the origin of life  Are we alone   And that especially happened in the last    years  at the end of the   th century  when the beautiful developments due to molecular biology  understanding the code of life  DNA  all of that seemed to actually put us  not closer  but further apart from answering those basic questions. Now  the good news. A lot has happened in the last few years  and let's start with the planets. Let's start with the old Copernican question  Are there earths around other stars  And as we already heard  there is a way in which we are trying  and now able  to answer that question. It's a new telescope. Our team  befittingly I think  named it after one of those dreamers of the Copernican time  Johannes Kepler  and that telescope's sole purpose is to go out  find the planets that orbit other stars in our galaxy  and tell us how often do planets like our own Earth happen to be out there. The telescope is actually built similarly to the  well known to you  Hubble Space Telescope  except it does have an additional lens    a wide field lens  as you would call it as a photographer. And if  in the next couple of months  you walk out in the early evening and look straight up and place you palm like this  you will actually be looking at the field of the sky where this telescope is searching for planets day and night  without any interruption  for the next four years. The way we do that  actually  is with a method  which we call the transit method. It's actually mini eclipses that occur when a planet passes in front of its star. Not all of the planets will be fortuitously oriented for us to be able do that  but if you have a million stars  you'll find enough planets. And as you see on this animation  what Kepler is going to detect is just the dimming of the light from the star. We are not going to see the image of the star and the planet as this. All the stars for Kepler are just points of light. But we learn a lot from that  not only that there is a planet there  but we also learn its size. How much of the light is being dimmed depends on how big the planet is. We learn about its orbit  the period of its orbit and so on. So  what have we learned  Well  let me try to walk you through what we actually see and so you understand the news that I'm here to tell you today. What Kepler does is discover a lot of candidates  which we then follow up and find as planets  confirm as planets. It basically tells us this is the distribution of planets in size. There are small planets  there are bigger planets  there are big planets  okay. So we count many  many such planets  and they have different sizes. We do that in our solar system. In fact  even back during the ancients  the Solar System in that sense would look on a diagram like this. There will be the smaller planets  and there will be the big planets  even back to the time of Epicurus and then of course Copernicus and his followers. Up until recently  that was the Solar System    four Earth like planets with small radius  smaller than about two times the size of the Earth    and that was of course Mercury  Venus  Mars  and of course the Earth  and then the two big  giant planets. Then the Copernican Revolution brought in telescopes  and of course three more planets were discovered. Now the total planet number in our solar system was nine. The small planets dominated  and there was a certain harmony to that  which actually Copernicus was very happy to note  and Kepler was one of the big proponents of. So now we have Pluto to join the numbers of small planets. But up until  literally     years ago  that was all we knew about planets. And that's what the frustration was. The Copernican dream was unfulfilled. Finally     years ago  the technology came to the point where we could discover a planet around another star  and we actually did pretty well. In the next    years  almost     planets were discovered orbiting other stars  with different methods. Unfortunately  as you can see  there was a very different picture. There was of course an explanation for it  We only see the big planets  so that's why most of those planets are really in the category of  like Jupiter.  But you see  we haven't gone very far. We were still back where Copernicus was. We didn't have any evidence whether planets like the Earth are out there. And we do care about planets like the Earth because by now we understood that life as a chemical system really needs a smaller planet with water and with rocks and with a lot of complex chemistry to originate  to emerge  to survive. And we didn't have the evidence for that. So today  I'm here to actually give you a first glimpse of what the new telescope  Kepler  has been able to tell us in the last few weeks  and  lo and behold  we are back to the harmony and to fulfilling the dreams of Copernicus. You can see here  the small planets dominate the picture. The planets which are marked  like Earth    are  definitely more than any other planets that we see. And now for the first time  we can say that. There is a lot more work we need to do with this. Most of these are candidates. In the next few years we will confirm them. But the statistical result is loud and clear. And the statistical result is that planets like our own Earth are out there. Our own Milky Way Galaxy is rich in this kind of planets. So the question is  what do we do next  Well  first of all  we can study them now that we know where they are. And we can find those that we would call habitable  meaning that they have similar conditions to the conditions that we experience here on Earth and where a lot of complex chemistry can happen. So  we can even put a number to how many of those planets now do we expect our own Milky Way Galaxy harbors. And the number  as you might expect  is pretty staggering. It's about     million such planets. That's great news. Why  Because with our own little telescope  just in the next two years  we'll be able to identify at least    of them. So that's great because then we can go and study them    remotely  of course    with all the techniques that we already have tested in the past five years. We can find what they're made of  would their atmospheres have water  carbon dioxide  methane. We know and expect that we'll see that. That's great  but that is not the whole news. That's not why I'm here. Why I'm here is to tell you that the next step is really the exciting part. The one that this step is enabling us to do is coming next. And here comes biology    biology  with its basic question  which still stands unanswered  which is essentially   If there is life on other planets  do we expect it to be like life on Earth   And let me immediately tell you here  when I say life  I don't mean  dolce vita   good life  human life. I really mean life on Earth  past and present  from microbes to us humans  in its rich molecular diversity  the way we now understand life on Earth as being a set of molecules and chemical reactions    and we call that  collectively  biochemistry  life as a chemical process  as a chemical phenomenon. So the question is  is that chemical phenomenon universal  or is it something which depends on the planet  Is it like gravity  which is the same everywhere in the universe  or there would be all kinds of different biochemistries wherever we find them  We need to know what we are looking for when we try to do that. And that's a very basic question  which we don't know the answer to  but which we can try    and we are trying    to answer in the lab. We don't need to go to space to answer that question. And so  that's what we are trying to do. And that's what many people now are trying to do. And a lot of the good news comes from that part of the bridge that we are trying to build as well. So this is one example that I want to show you here. When we think of what is necessary for the phenomenon that we call life  we think of compartmentalization  keeping the molecules which are important for life in a membrane  isolated from the rest of the environment  but yet  in an environment in which they actually could originate together. And in one of our labs  Jack Szostak's labs  it was a series of experiments in the last four years that showed that the environments    which are very common on planets  on certain types of planets like the Earth  where you have some liquid water and some clays    you actually end up with naturally available molecules which spontaneously form bubbles. But those bubbles have membranes very similar to the membrane of every cell of every living thing on Earth looks like  like this. And they really help molecules  like nucleic acids  like RNA and DNA  stay inside  develop  change  divide and do some of the processes that we call life. Now this is just an example to tell you the pathway in which we are trying to answer that bigger question about the universality of the phenomenon. And in a sense  you can think of that work that people are starting to do now around the world as building a bridge  building a bridge from two sides of the river. On one hand  on the left bank of the river  are the people like me who study those planets and try to define the environments. We don't want to go blind because there's too many possibilities  and there is not too much lab  and there is not enough human time to actually to do all the experiments. So that's what we are building from the left side of the river. From the right bank of the river are the experiments in the lab that I just showed you  where we actually tried that  and it feeds back and forth  and we hope to meet in the middle one day. So why should you care about that  Why am I trying to sell you a half built bridge  Am I that charming  Well  there are many reasons  and you heard some of them in the short talk today. This understanding of chemistry actually can help us with our daily lives. But there is something more profound here  something deeper. And that deeper  underlying point is that science is in the process of redefining life as we know it. And that is going to change our worldview in a profound way    not in a dissimilar way as     years ago  Copernicus' act did  by changing the way we view space and time. Now it's about something else  but it's equally profound. And half the time  what's happened is it's related this kind of sense of insignificance to humankind  to the Earth in a bigger space. And the more we learn  the more that was reinforced. You've all learned that in school    how small the Earth is compared to the immense universe. And the bigger the telescope  the bigger that universe becomes. And look at this image of the tiny  blue dot. This pixel is the Earth. It is the Earth as we know it. It is seen from  in this case  from outside the orbit of Saturn. But it's really tiny. We know that. Let's think of life as that entire planet because  in a sense  it is. The biosphere is the size of the Earth. Life on Earth is the size of the Earth. And let's compare it to the rest of the world in spatial terms. What if that Copernican insignificance was actually all wrong  Would that make us more responsible for what is happening today  Let's actually try that. So in space  the Earth is very small. Can you imagine how small it is  Let me try it. Okay  let's say this is the size of the observable universe  with all the galaxies  with all the stars  okay  from here to here. Do you know what the size of life in this necktie will be  It will be the size of a single  small atom. It is unimaginably small. We can't imagine it. I mean look  you can see the necktie  but you can't even imagine seeing the size of a little  small atom. But that's not the whole story  you see. The universe and life are both in space and time. If that was the age of the universe  then this is the age of life on Earth. Think about those oldest living things on Earth  but in a cosmic proportion. This is not insignificant. This is very significant. So life might be insignificant in size  but it is not insignificant in time. Life and the universe compare to each other like a child and a parent  parent and offspring. So what does this tell us  This tells us that that insignificance paradigm that we somehow got to learn from the Copernican principle  it's all wrong. There is immense  powerful potential in life in this universe    especially now that we know that places like the Earth are common. And that potential  that powerful potential  is also our potential  of you and me. And if we are to be stewards of our planet Earth and its biosphere  we'd better understand the cosmic significance and do something about it. And the good news is we can actually  indeed do it. And let's do it. Let's start this new revolution at the tail end of the old one  with synthetic biology being the way to transform both our environment and our future. And let's hope that we can build this bridge together and meet in the middle. Thank you very much. Up until now  our communication with machines has always been limited to conscious and direct forms. Whether it's something simple like turning on the lights with a switch  or even as complex as programming robotics  we have always had to give a command to a machine  or even a series of commands  in order for it to do something for us. Communication between people  on the other hand  is far more complex and a lot more interesting because we take into account so much more than what is explicitly expressed. We observe facial expressions  body language  and we can intuit feelings and emotions from our dialogue with one another. This actually forms a large part of our decision making process. Our vision is to introduce this whole new realm of human interaction into human computer interaction so that computers can understand not only what you direct it to do  but it can also respond to your facial expressions and emotional experiences. And what better way to do this than by interpreting the signals naturally produced by our brain  our center for control and experience. Well  it sounds like a pretty good idea  but this task  as Bruno mentioned  isn't an easy one for two main reasons  First  the detection algorithms. Our brain is made up of billions of active neurons  around         km of combined axon length. When these neurons interact  the chemical reaction emits an electrical impulse  which can be measured. The majority of our functional brain is distributed over the outer surface layer of the brain  and to increase the area that's available for mental capacity  the brain surface is highly folded. Now this cortical folding presents a significant challenge for interpreting surface electrical impulses. Each individual's cortex is folded differently  very much like a fingerprint. So even though a signal may come from the same functional part of the brain  by the time the structure has been folded  its physical location is very different between individuals  even identical twins. There is no longer any consistency in the surface signals. Our breakthrough was to create an algorithm that unfolds the cortex  so that we can map the signals closer to its source  and therefore making it capable of working across a mass population. The second challenge is the actual device for observing brainwaves. EEG measurements typically involve a hairnet with an array of sensors  like the one that you can see here in the photo. A technician will put the electrodes onto the scalp using a conductive gel or paste and usually after a procedure of preparing the scalp by light abrasion. Now this is quite time consuming and isn't the most comfortable process. And on top of that  these systems actually cost in the tens of thousands of dollars. So with that  I'd like to invite onstage Evan Grant  who is one of last year's speakers  who's kindly agreed to help me to demonstrate what we've been able to develop. So the device that you see is a    channel  high fidelity EEG acquisition system. It doesn't require any scalp preparation  no conductive gel or paste. It only takes a few minutes to put on and for the signals to settle. It's also wireless  so it gives you the freedom to move around. And compared to the tens of thousands of dollars for a traditional EEG system  this headset only costs a few hundred dollars. Now on to the detection algorithms. So facial expressions    as I mentioned before in emotional experiences    are actually designed to work out of the box with some sensitivity adjustments available for personalization. But with the limited time we have available  I'd like to show you the cognitive suite  which is the ability for you to basically move virtual objects with your mind. Now  Evan is new to this system  so what we have to do first is create a new profile for him. He's obviously not Joanne    so we'll  add user.  Evan. Okay. So the first thing we need to do with the cognitive suite is to start with training a neutral signal. With neutral  there's nothing in particular that Evan needs to do. He just hangs out. He's relaxed. And the idea is to establish a baseline or normal state for his brain  because every brain is different. It takes eight seconds to do this  and now that that's done  we can choose a movement based action. So Evan  choose something that you can visualize clearly in your mind. Evan Grant  Let's do  pull.  Tan Le  Okay  so let's choose  pull.  So the idea here now is that Evan needs to imagine the object coming forward into the screen  and there's a progress bar that will scroll across the screen while he's doing that. The first time  nothing will happen  because the system has no idea how he thinks about  pull.  But maintain that thought for the entire duration of the eight seconds. So  one  two  three  go. Okay. So once we accept this  the cube is live. So let's see if Evan can actually try and imagine pulling. Ah  good job  That's really amazing. So we have a little bit of time available  so I'm going to ask Evan to do a really difficult task. And this one is difficult because it's all about being able to visualize something that doesn't exist in our physical world. This is  disappear.  So what you want to do    at least with movement based actions  we do that all the time  so you can visualize it. But with  disappear   there's really no analogies    so Evan  what you want to do here is to imagine the cube slowly fading out  okay. Same sort of drill. So  one  two  three  go. Okay. Let's try that. Oh  my goodness. He's just too good. Let's try that again. EG  Losing concentration. TL  But we can see that it actually works  even though you can only hold it for a little bit of time. As I said  it's a very difficult process to imagine this. And the great thing about it is that we've only given the software one instance of how he thinks about  disappear.  As there is a machine learning algorithm in this    Thank you. Good job. Good job. Thank you  Evan  you're a wonderful  wonderful example of the technology. So  as you can see  before  there is a leveling system built into this software so that as Evan  or any user  becomes more familiar with the system  they can continue to add more and more detections  so that the system begins to differentiate between different distinct thoughts. And once you've trained up the detections  these thoughts can be assigned or mapped to any computing platform  application or device. So I'd like to show you a few examples  because there are many possible applications for this new interface. In games and virtual worlds  for example  your facial expressions can naturally and intuitively be used to control an avatar or virtual character. Obviously  you can experience the fantasy of magic and control the world with your mind. And also  colors  lighting  sound and effects can dynamically respond to your emotional state to heighten the experience that you're having  in real time. And moving on to some applications developed by developers and researchers around the world  with robots and simple machines  for example    in this case  flying a toy helicopter simply by thinking  lift  with your mind. The technology can also be applied to real world applications    in this example  a smart home. You know  from the user interface of the control system to opening curtains or closing curtains. And of course  also to the lighting    turning them on or off. And finally  to real life changing applications  such as being able to control an electric wheelchair. In this example  facial expressions are mapped to the movement commands. Man  Now blink right to go right. Now blink left to turn back left. Now smile to go straight. TL  We really    Thank you. We are really only scratching the surface of what is possible today  and with the community's input  and also with the involvement of developers and researchers from around the world  we hope that you can help us to shape where the technology goes from here. Thank you so much. So let me just start with my story. So I tore my knee joint meniscus cartilage playing soccer in college. Then I went on to tear my ACL  the ligament in my knee  and then developed an arthritic knee. And I'm sure that many of you in this audience have that same story  and  by the way  I married a woman who has exactly the same story. So this motivated me to become an orthopedic surgeon and to see if I couldn't focus on solutions for those problems that would keep me playing sports and not limit me. So with that  let me just show you a quick video to get you in the mood of what we're trying to explain. Narrator  We are all aware of the risk of cancer  but there's another disease that's destined to affect even more of us  arthritis. Cancer may kill you  but when you look at the numbers  arthritis ruins more lives. Assuming you live a long life  there's a    percent chance you'll develop arthritis. And it's not just aging that causes arthritis. Common injuries can lead to decades of pain  until our joints quite literally grind to a halt. Desperate for a solution  we've turned to engineering to design artificial components to replace our worn out body parts  but in the midst of the modern buzz around the promises of a bionic body  shouldn't we stop and ask if there's a better  more natural way  Let's consider an alternative path. What if all the replacements our bodies need already exist in nature  or within our own stem cells  This is the field of biologic replacements  where we replace worn out parts with new  natural ones. Kevin Stone  And so  the mission is  how do I treat these things biologically  And let's talk about both what I did for my wife  and what I've done for hundreds of other patients. First thing for my wife  and the most common thing I hear from my patients  particularly in the     to    year old age group     year old age group  is they come in and say   Hey  Doc  isn't there just a shock absorber you can put in my knee  I'm not ready for joint replacement.  And so for her  I put in a human meniscus allograft donor right into that  knee  joint space. And  the allograft  replaces  the missing meniscus . And then for that unstable ligament  we put in a human donor ligament to stabilize the knee. And then for the damaged arthritis on the surface  we did a stem cell paste graft  which we designed in       to regrow that articular cartilage surface and give it back a smooth surface there. So here's my wife's bad knee on the left  and her just hiking now four months later in Aspen  and doing well. And it works  not just for my wife  but certainly for other patients. The girl on the video  Jen Hudak  just won the Superpipe in Aspen just nine months after having destroyed her knee  as you see in the other image    and having a paste graft to that knee. And so we can regrow these surfaces biologically. So with all this success  why isn't that good enough  you might ask. Well the reason is because there's not enough donor cycles. There's not enough young  healthy people falling off their motorcycle and donating that tissue to us. And the tissue's very expensive. And so that's not going to be a solution that's going to get us global with biologic tissue. But the solution is animal tissue because it's plentiful  it's cheap  you can get it from young  healthy tissues  but the barrier is immunology. And the specific barrier is a specific epitope called the galactosyl  or gal epitope. So if we're going to transplant animal tissues to people  we have to figure out a way to get rid of that epitope. So my story in working with animal tissues starts in     . And I started first with cow Achilles tendon  where we would take the cow Achilles tendon  which is type I collagen  strip it of its antigens by degrading it with an acid and detergent wash and forming it into a regeneration template. We would then take that regeneration template and insert it into the missing meniscus cartilage to regrow that in a patient's knee. We've now done that procedure  and it's been done worldwide in over       cases  so it's an FDA approved and worldwide accepted way to regrow the meniscus. And that's great when I can degrade the tissue. But what happens for your ligament when I need an intact ligament  I can't grind it up in a blender. So in that case  I have to design    and we designed with Uri Galili and Tom Turek    an enzyme wash to wash away  or strip  those galactosyl epitopes with a specific enzyme. And we call that a  gal stripping  technique. What we do is humanize the tissue. It's by gal stripping that tissue we humanize it  Laughter   and then we can put it back into a patient's knee. And we've done that. Now we've taken pig ligament    young  healthy  big tissue  put it into    patients in an FDA approved trial    and then one of our patients went on to have three Canadian Masters Downhill championships    on his  pig lig   as he calls it. So we know it can work. And there's a wide clinical trial of this tissue now pending. So what about the next step  What about getting to a total biologic knee replacement  not just the parts  How are we going to revolutionize artificial joint replacement  Well here's how we're going to do it. So what we're going to do is take an articular cartilage from a young  healthy pig  strip it of its antigens  load it with your stem cells  then put it back on to that arthritic surface in your knee  tack it on there  have you heal that surface and then create a new biologic surface for your knee. So that's our biologic approach right now. We're going to rebuild your knee with the parts. We're going to resurface it with a completely new surface. But we have other advantages from the animal kingdom. There's a benefit of     million years of ambulation. We can harness those benefits. We can use thicker  younger  better tissues than you might have injured in your knee  or that you might have when you're        or   . We can do it as an outpatient procedure. We can strip that tissue very economically  and so this is how we can get biologic knee replacement to go global. And so welcome to super biologics. It's not hardware. It's not software. It's bioware. It's version  .  of you. And so with that  coming to a    coming to an operating theater near you soon  I believe. Thank you very much. Today  I'm going to take you around the world in    minutes. My base of operations is in the U.S.  but let's start at the other end of the map  in Kyoto  Japan  where I was living with a Japanese family while I was doing part of my dissertational research    years ago. I knew even then that I would encounter cultural differences and misunderstandings  but they popped up when I least expected it. On my first day  I went to a restaurant  and I ordered a cup of green tea with sugar. After a pause  the waiter said   One does not put sugar in green tea.   I know   I said.  I'm aware of this custom. But I really like my tea sweet.  In response  he gave me an even more courteous version of the same explanation.  One does not put sugar in green tea.   I understand   I said   that the Japanese do not put sugar in their green tea  but I'd like to put some sugar in my green tea.  Surprised by my insistence  the waiter took up the issue with the manager. Pretty soon  a lengthy discussion ensued  and finally the manager came over to me and said   I am very sorry. We do not have sugar.  Well  since I couldn't have my tea the way I wanted it  I ordered a cup of coffee  which the waiter brought over promptly. Resting on the saucer were two packets of sugar. My failure to procure myself a cup of sweet  green tea was not due to a simple misunderstanding. This was due to a fundamental difference in our ideas about choice. From my American perspective  when a paying customer makes a reasonable request based on her preferences  she has every right to have that request met. The American way  to quote Burger King  is to  have it your way   because  as Starbucks says   happiness is in your choices.  But from the Japanese perspective  it's their duty to protect those who don't know any better    in this case  the ignorant gaijin    from making the wrong choice. Let's face it  the way I wanted my tea was inappropriate according to cultural standards  and they were doing their best to help me save face. Americans tend to believe that they've reached some sort of pinnacle in the way they practice choice. They think that choice  as seen through the American lens best fulfills an innate and universal desire for choice in all humans. Unfortunately  these beliefs are based on assumptions that don't always hold true in many countries  in many cultures. At times they don't even hold true at America's own borders. I'd like to discuss some of these assumptions and the problems associated with them. As I do so  I hope you'll start thinking about some of your own assumptions and how they were shaped by your backgrounds. First assumption  if a choice affects you  then you should be the one to make it. This is the only way to ensure that your preferences and interests will be most fully accounted for. It is essential for success. In America  the primary locus of choice is the individual. People must choose for themselves  sometimes sticking to their guns  regardless of what other people want or recommend. It's called  being true to yourself.  But do all individuals benefit from taking such an approach to choice  Mark Lepper and I did a series of studies in which we sought the answer to this very question. In one study  which we ran in Japantown  San Francisco  we brought seven  to nine year old Anglo  and Asian American children into the laboratory  and we divided them up into three groups. The first group came in  and they were greeted by Miss Smith  who showed them six big piles of anagram puzzles. The kids got to choose which pile of anagrams they would like to do  and they even got to choose which marker they would write their answers with. When the second group of children came in  they were brought to the same room  shown the same anagrams  but this time Miss Smith told them which anagrams to do and which markers to write their answers with. Now when the third group came in  they were told that their anagrams and their markers had been chosen by their mothers. In reality  the kids who were told what to do  whether by Miss Smith or their mothers  were actually given the very same activity  which their counterparts in the first group had freely chosen. With this procedure  we were able to ensure that the kids across the three groups all did the same activity  making it easier for us to compare performance. Such small differences in the way we administered the activity yielded striking differences in how well they performed. Anglo Americans  they did two and a half times more anagrams when they got to choose them  as compared to when it was chosen for them by Miss Smith or their mothers. It didn't matter who did the choosing  if the task was dictated by another  their performance suffered. In fact  some of the kids were visibly embarrassed when they were told that their mothers had been consulted. One girl named Mary said   You asked my mother   In contrast  Asian American children performed best when they believed their mothers had made the choice  second best when they chose for themselves  and least well when it had been chosen by Miss Smith. A girl named Natsumi even approached Miss Smith as she was leaving the room and tugged on her skirt and asked   Could you please tell my mommy I did it just like she said   The first generation children were strongly influenced by their immigrant parents' approach to choice. For them  choice was not just a way of defining and asserting their individuality  but a way to create community and harmony by deferring to the choices of people whom they trusted and respected. If they had a concept of being true to one's self  then that self  most likely   was  composed  not of an individual  but of a collective. Success was just as much about pleasing key figures as it was about satisfying one's own preferences. Or  you could say that the individual's preferences were shaped by the preferences of specific others. The assumption then that we do best when the individual self chooses only holds when that self is clearly divided from others. When  in contrast  two or more individuals see their choices and their outcomes as intimately connected  then they may amplify one another's success by turning choosing into a collective act. To insist that they choose independently might actually compromise both their performance and their relationships. Yet that is exactly what the American paradigm demands. It leaves little room for interdependence or an acknowledgment of individual fallibility. It requires that everyone treat choice as a private and self defining act. People that have grown up in such a paradigm might find it motivating  but it is a mistake to assume that everyone thrives under the pressure of choosing alone. The second assumption which informs the American view of choice goes something like this. The more choices you have  the more likely you are to make the best choice. So bring it on  Walmart  with         different products  and Amazon  with    million books and Match.com with    what is it        million date possibilities now. You will surely find the perfect match. Let's test this assumption by heading over to Eastern Europe. Here  I interviewed people who were residents of formerly communist countries  who had all faced the challenge of transitioning to a more democratic and capitalistic society. One of the most interesting revelations came not from an answer to a question  but from a simple gesture of hospitality. When the participants arrived for their interview  I offered them a set of drinks  Coke  Diet Coke  Sprite    seven  to be exact. During the very first session  which was run in Russia  one of the participants made a comment that really caught me off guard.  Oh  but it doesn't matter. It's all just soda. That's just one choice.  I was so struck by this comment that from then on  I started to offer all the participants those seven sodas  and I asked them   How many choices are these   Again and again  they perceived these seven different sodas  not as seven choices  but as one choice  soda or no soda. When I put out juice and water in addition to these seven sodas  now they perceived it as only three choices    juice  water and soda. Compare this to the die hard devotion of many Americans  not just to a particular flavor of soda  but to a particular brand. You know  research shows repeatedly that we can't actually tell the difference between Coke and Pepsi. Of course  you and I know that Coke is the better choice. For modern Americans who are exposed to more options and more ads associated with options than anyone else in the world  choice is just as much about who they are as it is about what the product is. Combine this with the assumption that more choices are always better  and you have a group of people for whom every little difference matters and so every choice matters. But for Eastern Europeans  the sudden availability of all these consumer products on the marketplace was a deluge. They were flooded with choice before they could protest that they didn't know how to swim. When asked   What words and images do you associate with choice   Grzegorz from Warsaw said   Ah  for me it is fear. There are some dilemmas you see. I am used to no choice.  Bohdan from Kiev said  in response to how he felt about the new consumer marketplace   It is too much. We do not need everything that is there.  A sociologist from the Warsaw Survey Agency explained   The older generation jumped from nothing to choice all around them. They were never given a chance to learn how to react.  And Tomasz  a young Polish man said   I don't need twenty kinds of chewing gum. I don't mean to say that I want no choice  but many of these choices are quite artificial.  In reality  many choices are between things that are not that much different. The value of choice depends on our ability to perceive differences between the options. Americans train their whole lives to play  spot the difference.  They practice this from such an early age that they've come to believe that everyone must be born with this ability. In fact  though all humans share a basic need and desire for choice  we don't all see choice in the same places or to the same extent. When someone can't see how one choice is unlike another  or when there are too many choices to compare and contrast  the process of choosing can be confusing and frustrating. Instead of making better choices  we become overwhelmed by choice  sometimes even afraid of it. Choice no longer offers opportunities  but imposes constraints. It's not a marker of liberation  but of suffocation by meaningless minutiae. In other words  choice can develop into the very opposite of everything it represents in America when it is thrust upon those who are insufficiently prepared for it. But it is not only other people in other places that are feeling the pressure of ever increasing choice. Americans themselves are discovering that unlimited choice seems more attractive in theory than in practice. We all have physical  mental and emotional  Laughter  limitations that make it impossible for us to process every single choice we encounter  even in the grocery store  let alone over the course of our entire lives. A number of my studies have shown that when you give people    or more options when they're making a choice  they make poorer decisions  whether it be health care  investment  other critical areas. Yet still  many of us believe that we should make all our own choices and seek out even more of them. This brings me to the third  and perhaps most problematic  assumption   You must never say no to choice.  To examine this  let's go back to the U.S. and then hop across the pond to France. Right outside Chicago  a young couple  Susan and Daniel Mitchell  were about to have their first baby. They'd already picked out a name for her  Barbara  after her grandmother. One night  when Susan was seven months pregnant  she started to experience contractions and was rushed to the emergency room. The baby was delivered through a C section  but Barbara suffered cerebral anoxia  a loss of oxygen to the brain. Unable to breathe on her own  she was put on a ventilator. Two days later  the doctors gave the Mitchells a choice  They could either remove Barbara off the life support  in which case she would die within a matter of hours  or they could keep her on life support  in which case she might still die within a matter of days. If she survived  she would remain in a permanent vegetative state  never able to walk  talk or interact with others. What do they do  What do any parent do  In a study I conducted with Simona Botti and Kristina Orfali  American and French parents were interviewed. They had all suffered the same tragedy. In all cases  the life support was removed  and the infants had died. But there was a big difference. In France  the doctors decided whether and when the life support would be removed  while in the United States  the final decision rested with the parents. We wondered  does this have an effect on how the parents cope with the loss of their loved one  We found that it did. Even up to a year later  American parents were more likely to express negative emotions  as compared to their French counterparts. French parents were more likely to say things like   Noah was here for so little time  but he taught us so much. He gave us a new perspective on life.  American parents were more likely to say things like   What if  What if   Another parent complained   I feel as if they purposefully tortured me. How did they get me to do that   And another parent said   I feel as if I've played a role in an execution.  But when the American parents were asked if they would rather have had the doctors make the decision  they all said   No.  They could not imagine turning that choice over to another  even though having made that choice made them feel trapped  guilty  angry. In a number of cases they were even clinically depressed. These parents could not contemplate giving up the choice  because to do so would have gone contrary to everything they had been taught and everything they had come to believe about the power and purpose of choice. In her essay   The White Album   Joan Didion writes   We tell ourselves stories in order to live. We interpret what we see  select the most workable of the multiple choices. We live entirely by the imposition of a narrative line upon disparate images  by the idea with which we have learned to freeze the shifting phantasmagoria  which is our actual experience.  The story Americans tell  the story upon which the American dream depends  is the story of limitless choice. This narrative promises so much  freedom  happiness  success. It lays the world at your feet and says   You can have anything  everything.  It's a great story  and it's understandable why they would be reluctant to revise it. But when you take a close look  you start to see the holes  and you start to see that the story can be told in many other ways. Americans have so often tried to disseminate their ideas of choice  believing that they will be  or ought to be  welcomed with open hearts and minds. But the history books and the daily news tell us it doesn't always work out that way. The phantasmagoria  the actual experience that we try to understand and organize through narrative  varies from place to place. No single narrative serves the needs of everyone everywhere. Moreover  Americans themselves could benefit from incorporating new perspectives into their own narrative  which has been driving their choices for so long. Robert Frost once said that   It is poetry that is lost in translation.  This suggests that whatever is beautiful and moving  whatever gives us a new way to see  cannot be communicated to those who speak a different language. But Joseph Brodsky said that   It is poetry that is gained in translation   suggesting that translation can be a creative  transformative act. When it comes to choice  we have far more to gain than to lose by engaging in the many translations of the narratives. Instead of replacing one story with another  we can learn from and revel in the many versions that exist and the many that have yet to be written. No matter where we're from and what your narrative is  we all have a responsibility to open ourselves up to a wider array of what choice can do  and what it can represent. And this does not lead to a paralyzing moral relativism. Rather  it teaches us when and how to act. It brings us that much closer to realizing the full potential of choice  to inspiring the hope and achieving the freedom that choice promises but doesn't always deliver. If we learn to speak to one another  albeit through translation  then we can begin to see choice in all its strangeness  complexity and compelling beauty. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Thank you. Sheena  there is a detail about your biography that we have not written in the program book. But by now it's evident to everyone in this room. You're blind. And I guess one of the questions on everybody's mind is  How does that influence your study of choosing because that's an activity that for most people is associated with visual inputs like aesthetics and color and so on  Sheena Iyengar  Well  it's funny that you should ask that because one of the things that's interesting about being blind is you actually get a different vantage point when you observe the way sighted people make choices. And as you just mentioned  there's lots of choices out there that are very visual these days. Yeah  I    as you would expect    get pretty frustrated by choices like what nail polish to put on because I have to rely on what other people suggest. And I can't decide. And so one time I was in a beauty salon  and I was trying to decide between two very light shades of pink. And one was called  Ballet Slippers.  And the other one was called  Adorable.  And so I asked these two ladies  and the one lady told me   Well  you should definitely wear 'Ballet Slippers.'   Well  what does it look like    Well  it's a very elegant shade of pink.   Okay  great.  The other lady tells me to wear  Adorable.   What does it look like    It's a glamorous shade of pink.  And so I asked them   Well  how do I tell them apart  What's different about them   And they said   Well  one is elegant  the other one's glamorous.  Okay  we got that. And the only thing they had consensus on  well  if I could see them  I would clearly be able to tell them apart. And what I wondered was whether they were being affected by the name or the content of the color  so I decided to do a little experiment. So I brought these two bottles of nail polish into the laboratory  and I stripped the labels off. And I brought women into the laboratory  and I asked them   Which one would you pick      percent of the women accused me of playing a trick  of putting the same color nail polish in both those bottles. At which point you start to wonder who the trick's really played on. Now  of the women that could tell them apart  when the labels were off  they picked  Adorable   and when the labels were on  they picked  Ballet Slippers.  So as far as I can tell  a rose by any other name probably does look different and maybe even smells different. BG  Thank you. Sheena Iyengar. Thank you Sheena. For a moment  what I need to do is project something on the screen of your imagination. We're in   th century Japan on the west coast  and a little  wizened monk is hurrying along  near midnight  to the crest of a small hill. He arrives on the small hill  dripping with water. He stands there  and he looks across at the island  Sado. And he scans across the ocean  and he looks at the sky. Then he says to himself  very quietly    Turbulent the sea    Stretching across to Sado   The Milky Way .  Basho was a brilliant man. He said more with less than any human that I have ever read or talked to. Basho  in    syllables  juxtaposed a turbulent ocean driven by a storm now past  and captured the almost impossible beauty of our home galaxy with millions of stars  probably hundreds and hundreds of    who knows how many    planets  maybe even an ocean that we will probably call Sylvia in time. As he was nearing his death  his disciples and followers kept asking him   What's the secret  How can you make haiku poems so beautiful so easily   And toward the end  he said   If you would know the pine tree  go to the pine tree.  That was it. Sylvia has said we must use every capacity we have in order to know the oceans. If we would know the oceans  we must go to the oceans. And what I'd like to talk to you today about  a little bit  is really transforming the relationship  or the interplay  between humans and oceans with a new capability that is not at all routine yet. I hope it will be. There are a few key points. One of them is the oceans are central to the quality of life on earth. Another is that there are bold  new ways of studying oceans that we have not used well yet. And the last is that these bold  new ways that we are exploring as a community will transform the way we look at our planet  our oceans  and eventually how we manage probably the entire planet  for what it's worth. So what scientists do when they begin is to start with the system. They define what the system is. The system isn't Chesapeake Bay. It's not the Kuril arc. It's not even the entire Pacific. It's the whole planet  the entire planet  continents and oceans together. That's the system. And basically  our challenge is to optimize the benefits and mitigate the risks of living on a planet that's driven by only two processes  two sources of energy  one of which is solar  that drives the winds  the waves  the clouds  the storms and photosynthesis. The second one is internal energy. And these two war against one another almost continuously. Mountain ranges  plate tectonics  moves the continents around  forms ore deposits. Volcanoes erupt. That's the planet that we live on. It's immensely complex. Now I don't expect all of you to see all the details here  but what I want you to see is this is about    percent of the processes that operate within the oceans almost continuously  and have for the last   billion years. This is a system that's been around a very long time. And these have all co evolved. What do I mean by that  They interact with one another constantly. All of them interact with one another. So the complexity of this system that we're looking at  the one driven by the sun    upper portion  mostly    and the lower portion is partly driven by the input from heat below and by other processes. This is very  very important because this is the system  this is the crucible  out of which life on the planet came  and it's now time for us to understand it. We must understand it. That's one of the themes that Sylvia reminds us about  understand this ocean of ours  this basic life support system  the dominant life support system on the planet. Look at this complexity here. This is only one variable. If you can see the complexity  you can see how tiny  little eddies and large eddies and the motion    this is just sea surface temperature  but it's immensely complicated. Now a layer in  the other two or three hundred processes that are all interacting  partly as a function of temperature  partly as a function of all the other factors  and you've got a really complicated system. That's our challenge  is to understand  understand this system in new and phenomenal ways. And there's an urgency to this. Part of the urgency comes from the fact that  of order  a billion people on the planet currently are undernourished or starving. And part of the issue is for Cody    who's here     years old    and I have permission to relay this number. When he     years from now  is the age of Nancy Brown  there are going to be another two and a half billion people on the planet. We can't solve all the problems by looking only at the oceans  but if we don't understand the fundamental life support system of this planet much more thoroughly than we do now  then the stresses that we will face  and that Cody will face  and even Nancy  who's going to live till she's     will have really problems coping. All right  let's talk about another perspective on the importance of the oceans. Look at this diagram  which is showing warm waters in red  cool waters in blue  and on the continents  what you're seeing in bright green  is the growth of vegetation  and in olive green  the dieback of vegetation. And in the lower left hand corner there's a clock ticking away from      to      and then cycling again. What you'll see is that the rhythms of growth  of vegetation    a subset of which is food on the continents    is directly tied to the rhythms of the sea surface temperatures. The oceans control  or at least significantly influence  correlate with  the growth patterns and the drought patterns and the rain patterns on the continents. So people in Kansas  in a wheat field in Kansas  need to understand that the oceans are central to them as well. Another complexity  this is the age of the oceans. I'm going to layer in on top of this the tectonic plates. The age of the ocean  the tectonic plates  gives rise to a totally new phenomenon that we have heard about in this conference. And I share with you some very high definition video that we collected in real time. Seconds after this video was taken  people in Beijing  people in Sydney  people in Amsterdam  people in Washington D.C. were watching this. Now you've heard of hydrothermal vents  but the other discovery is that deep below the sea floor  there is vast reservoir of microbial activity  which we have only just discovered and we have almost no way to study. Some people have estimated that the biomass tied up in these microbes living in the pours and the cracks of the sea floor and below rival the total amount of living biomass at the surface of the planet. It's an astonishing insight  and we have only found out about this recently. This is very  very exciting. It may be the next rainforest  in terms of pharmaceuticals. We know little or nothing about it. Well  Marcel Proust has this wonderful saying that   The real voyage of discovery consists not so much in seeking new territory  but possibly in having new sets of eyes   new ways of seeing things  a new mindset. And many of you remember the early stages of oceanography  when we had to use what we had at our fingertips. And it wasn't easy. It wasn't easy in those days. Some of you remember this  I'm sure. And now  we have an entire suite of tools that are really pretty powerful    ships  satellites  moorings. But they don't quite cut it. They don't quite give us what we need. And the program that I wanted to talk to you about just a little bit here  was funded  and it involves autonomous vehicles like the one running across the base of this image. Modeling  on the right hand side  there's a very complex computational model. On the left hand side  there's a new type of mooring  which I'll show you in just a second. And on the basis of several points  the oceans are complex  and they're central to the life on earth. They are changing rapidly  but not predictably. And the models that we need to predict the future do not have enough data to refine them. The computational power is amazing. But without data  those models will never ever be predicted. And that's what we really need. For a variety of reasons they're dangerous  but we feel that OOI  this Ocean Observatory Initiative  which the National Science Foundation has begun to fund  has the potential to really transform things. And the goal of the program is to launch an era of scientific discovery and understanding across and within the ocean basins  utilizing widely accessible  interactive telepresence. It's a new world. We will be present throughout the volume of the ocean  at will  communicating in real time. And this is what the system involves  a number of sites in the southern hemisphere  shown in those circles. And in the northern hemisphere there are four sites. I won't talk a lot about most of them right here  but the one on the west coast  that's in the box  is called the regional scale nodes. It was once called Neptune. And let me show you what's behind it. Fiber  next generation way of communicating. You can see the copper tips on these things. You can transmit power  but the bandwidth is in those tiny  little threads smaller than the hair on your head in diameter. And this particular set here can transmit something of the order of three to five terabits per second. This is phenomenal bandwidth. And this is what the planet looks like. We are already laced up as if we're in a fiber optic corset  if you like. This is what it looks like. And the cables go really continent to continent. It's a very powerful system  and most of our communications consist of it. So this is the system that I'm talking about  off the west coast. It's coincident with the tectonic plate  the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate. And it's going to deliver abundant power and unprecedented bandwidth across this entire volume    in the overlying ocean  on the sea floor and below the sea floor. Bandwidth and power and a wide variety of processes that will be operating. This is what one of those primary nodes looks like  and it's like a sub station with power and bandwidth that can spread out over an area the size of Seattle. And the kind of science that can be done will be determined by a variety of scientists who want to be involved and can bring the instrumentation to the table. They will bring it and link it in. It'll be  in a sense  like having time on a telescope  except you'll have your own port. Climate change  ocean acidification  dissolved oxygen  carbon cycle  coastal upwelling  fishing dynamics    the full spectrum of earth science and ocean science simultaneously in the same volume. So anyone coming along later simply accesses the database and can draw down the information they need about anything that has taken place. And this is just the first of these. In conjunction with our Canadian colleagues  we've set this up. Now I want to take you into the caldera. On the left hand side there is a large volcano called Axial Seamount. And we're going to go down into the Axial Seamount using animation. Here's what this system is going to look like that we are funded to build at this point. Very powerful. That's an elevator that's constantly moving up and down  but it can be controlled by the folks on land who are responsible for it. Or they can transfer control to someone in India or China who can take over for a while  because it's all going to be directly connected through the Internet. There will be massive amounts of data flowing ashore  all available to anyone who has any interest in using it. This is going to be much more powerful than having a single ship in a single location  then move to a new location. We're flying across the caldera floor. There is a number of robotic systems. There's cameras that can be turned on and off at your will  if those are your experiments. The kinds of systems that will be down there  the kinds of instruments that will be on the sea floor  consist of    if you can read them there    there's cameras  there's pressure sensors  fluorometers  there's seismometers. It's a full spectrum of tools. Now  that mound right there actually looks like this. This is what it actually looks like. And this is the kind of activity that we can see with high definition video  because the bandwidth of these cables is so huge that we could have five to    stereo HD systems running continuously and  again  directed through robotic techniques from land. Very  very powerful. And these are the things that we're funded to do today. So what can we actually do tomorrow  We're about to ride the wave of technological opportunity. There are emerging technologies throughout the field around oceanography  which we will incorporate into oceanography  and through that convergence  we will transform oceanography into something even more magical. Robotics systems are just incredible these days  absolutely incredible. And we will be bringing robotics of all sorts into the ocean. Nanotechnology  this is a small generator. It's smaller than a postage stamp  and it can generate power just by being attached to your shirt as you move. Just as you move  it generates power. There are many kinds of things that can be used in the ocean  continuously. Imaging  Many of you know a good deal more about this type of thing than I  but stereo imaging at four times the definition that we have in HD will be routine within five years. And this is the magic one. As a result of the human genome process  we are in a situation where events that take place in the ocean    like an erupting volcano  or something of that sort    can actually be sampled. We pump the fluid through one of these systems  and we press the button  and it's analyzed for the genomic character. And that's transmitted back to land immediately. So in the volume of the ocean  we will know  not just the physics and the chemistry  but the base of the food chain will be transparent to us with data on a continuous basis. Grid computing  the power of grid computers is going to be just amazing here. We will soon be using grid computing to do pretty much everything  like adjust the data and everything that goes with the data. The power generation will come from the ocean itself. And the next generation fiber will be simply magic. It's far beyond what we currently have. So the presence of the power and the bandwidth in the environment will allow all of these new technologies to converge in a manner that is just unprecedented. So within five to seven years  I see us having a capacity to be completely present throughout the ocean and have all of that connected to the Internet  so we can reach many  many folks. Delivering the power and the bandwidth into the ocean will dramatically accelerate adaptation. Here's an example. When earthquakes take place  massive amounts of these new microbes we've never seen before come out of the sea floor. We have a way of addressing that  a new way of addressing that. We've determined from the earthquake activity that you're seeing here that the top of that volcano is erupting  so we deploy the troops. What are the troops  The troops are the autonomous vehicles  of course. And they fly into the erupting volcano. They sample the fluids coming out of the sea floor during an eruption  which have the microbes that have never been to the surface of the planet before. They eject it to the surface where it floats  and it is picked up by an autonomous airplane  and it's brought back to the laboratory within    hours of the eruption. This is doable. All the pieces are there. A laboratory  many of you heard what happened on    . Some doctors in New York City removed the gallbladder of a woman in France. We could do work on the sea floor that would be stunning  and it would be on live TV  if we have interesting things to show. So we can bring an entirely new telepresence to the world  throughout the ocean. This    I've shown you sea floor    but so the goal here is real time interaction with the oceans from anywhere on earth. It's going to be amazing. And as I go here  I just want to show you what we can bring into classrooms  and indeed  what we can bring into your pocket. Many of you don't think of this yet  but the ocean will be in your pocket. It won't be long. It won't be long. So let me leave you then with a few words from another poet  if you'll forgive me. In       T.S. Eliot wrote the  Four Quartets.  He won the Nobel Prize for literature in     . In  Little Gidding  he says    speaking I think for the human race  but certainly for the TED Conference and Sylvia     We shall not cease from exploration  and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time  arrive through the unknown remembered gate where the last of earth left to discover is that which was the beginning. At the source of the longest river the voice of a hidden waterfall not known because not looked for  but heard  half heard in the stillness beneath the waves of the sea.  Thank you. I want to start my talk today with two observations about the human species. The first observation is something that you might think is quite obvious  and that's that our species  Homo sapiens  is actually really  really smart    like  ridiculously smart    like you're all doing things that no other species on the planet does right now. And this is  of course  not the first time you've probably recognized this. Of course  in addition to being smart  we're also an extremely vain species. So we like pointing out the fact that we're smart. You know  so I could turn to pretty much any sage from Shakespeare to Stephen Colbert to point out things like the fact that we're noble in reason and infinite in faculties and just kind of awesome er than anything else on the planet when it comes to all things cerebral. But of course  there's a second observation about the human species that I want to focus on a little bit more  and that's the fact that even though we're actually really smart  sometimes uniquely smart  we can also be incredibly  incredibly dumb when it comes to some aspects of our decision making. Now I'm seeing lots of smirks out there. Don't worry  I'm not going to call anyone in particular out on any aspects of your own mistakes. But of course  just in the last two years we see these unprecedented examples of human ineptitude. And we've watched as the tools we uniquely make to pull the resources out of our environment kind of just blow up in our face. We've watched the financial markets that we uniquely create    these markets that were supposed to be foolproof    we've watched them kind of collapse before our eyes. But both of these two embarrassing examples  I think  don't highlight what I think is most embarrassing about the mistakes that humans make  which is that we'd like to think that the mistakes we make are really just the result of a couple bad apples or a couple really sort of FAIL Blog worthy decisions. But it turns out  what social scientists are actually learning is that most of us  when put in certain contexts  will actually make very specific mistakes. The errors we make are actually predictable. We make them again and again. And they're actually immune to lots of evidence. When we get negative feedback  we still  the next time we're face with a certain context  tend to make the same errors. And so this has been a real puzzle to me as a sort of scholar of human nature. What I'm most curious about is  how is a species that's as smart as we are capable of such bad and such consistent errors all the time  You know  we're the smartest thing out there  why can't we figure this out  In some sense  where do our mistakes really come from  And having thought about this a little bit  I see a couple different possibilities. One possibility is  in some sense  it's not really our fault. Because we're a smart species  we can actually create all kinds of environments that are super  super complicated  sometimes too complicated for us to even actually understand  even though we've actually created them. We create financial markets that are super complex. We create mortgage terms that we can't actually deal with. And of course  if we are put in environments where we can't deal with it  in some sense makes sense that we actually might mess certain things up. If this was the case  we'd have a really easy solution to the problem of human error. We'd actually just say  okay  let's figure out the kinds of technologies we can't deal with  the kinds of environments that are bad    get rid of those  design things better  and we should be the noble species that we expect ourselves to be. But there's another possibility that I find a little bit more worrying  which is  maybe it's not our environments that are messed up. Maybe it's actually us that's designed badly. This is a hint that I've gotten from watching the ways that social scientists have learned about human errors. And what we see is that people tend to keep making errors exactly the same way  over and over again. It feels like we might almost just be built to make errors in certain ways. This is a possibility that I worry a little bit more about  because  if it's us that's messed up  it's not actually clear how we go about dealing with it. We might just have to accept the fact that we're error prone and try to design things around it. So this is the question my students and I wanted to get at. How can we tell the difference between possibility one and possibility two  What we need is a population that's basically smart  can make lots of decisions  but doesn't have access to any of the systems we have  any of the things that might mess us up    no human technology  human culture  maybe even not human language. And so this is why we turned to these guys here. These are one of the guys I work with. This is a brown capuchin monkey. These guys are New World primates  which means they broke off from the human branch about    million years ago. This means that your great  great  great great  great  great    with about five million  greats  in there    grandmother was probably the same great  great  great  great grandmother with five million  greats  in there as Holly up here. You know  so you can take comfort in the fact that this guy up here is a really really distant  but albeit evolutionary  relative. The good news about Holly though is that she doesn't actually have the same kinds of technologies we do. You know  she's a smart  very cut creature  a primate as well  but she lacks all the stuff we think might be messing us up. So she's the perfect test case. What if we put Holly into the same context as humans  Does she make the same mistakes as us  Does she not learn from them  And so on. And so this is the kind of thing we decided to do. My students and I got very excited about this a few years ago. We said  all right  let's  you know  throw so problems at Holly  see if she messes these things up. First problem is just  well  where should we start  Because  you know  it's great for us  but bad for humans. We make a lot of mistakes in a lot of different contexts. You know  where are we actually going to start with this  And because we started this work around the time of the financial collapse  around the time when foreclosures were hitting the news  we said  hhmm  maybe we should actually start in the financial domain. Maybe we should look at monkey's economic decisions and try to see if they do the same kinds of dumb things that we do. Of course  that's when we hit a sort second problem    a little bit more methodological    which is that  maybe you guys don't know  but monkeys don't actually use money. I know  you haven't met them. But this is why  you know  they're not in the queue behind you at the grocery store or the ATM    you know  they don't do this stuff. So now we faced  you know  a little bit of a problem here. How are we actually going to ask monkeys about money if they don't actually use it  So we said  well  maybe we should just  actually just suck it up and teach monkeys how to use money. So that's just what we did. What you're looking at over here is actually the first unit that I know of of non human currency. We weren't very creative at the time we started these studies  so we just called it a token. But this is the unit of currency that we've taught our monkeys at Yale to actually use with humans  to actually buy different pieces of food. It doesn't look like much    in fact  it isn't like much. Like most of our money  it's just a piece of metal. As those of you who've taken currencies home from your trip know  once you get home  it's actually pretty useless. It was useless to the monkeys at first before they realized what they could do with it. When we first gave it to them in their enclosures  they actually kind of picked them up  looked at them. They were these kind of weird things. But very quickly  the monkeys realized that they could actually hand these tokens over to different humans in the lab for some food. And so you see one of our monkeys  Mayday  up here doing this. This is A and B are kind of the points where she's sort of a little bit curious about these things    doesn't know. There's this waiting hand from a human experimenter  and Mayday quickly figures out  apparently the human wants this. Hands it over  and then gets some food. It turns out not just Mayday  all of our monkeys get good at trading tokens with human salesman. So here's just a quick video of what this looks like. Here's Mayday. She's going to be trading a token for some food and waiting happily and getting her food. Here's Felix  I think. He's our alpha male  he's a kind of big guy. But he too waits patiently  gets his food and goes on. So the monkeys get really good at this. They're surprisingly good at this with very little training. We just allowed them to pick this up on their own. The question is  is this anything like human money  Is this a market at all  or did we just do a weird psychologist's trick by getting monkeys to do something  looking smart  but not really being smart. And so we said  well  what would the monkeys spontaneously do if this was really their currency  if they were really using it like money  Well  you might actually imagine them to do all the kinds of smart things that humans do when they start exchanging money with each other. You might have them start paying attention to price  paying attention to how much they buy    sort of keeping track of their monkey token  as it were. Do the monkeys do anything like this  And so our monkey marketplace was born. The way this works is that our monkeys normally live in a kind of big zoo social enclosure. When they get a hankering for some treats  we actually allowed them a way out into a little smaller enclosure where they could enter the market. Upon entering the market    it was actually a much more fun market for the monkeys than most human markets because  as the monkeys entered the door of the market  a human would give them a big wallet full of tokens so they could actually trade the tokens with one of these two guys here    two different possible human salesmen that they could actually buy stuff from. The salesmen were students from my lab. They dressed differently  they were different people. And over time  they did basically the same thing so the monkeys could learn  you know  who sold what at what price    you know  who was reliable  who wasn't  and so on. And you can see that each of the experimenters is actually holding up a little  yellow food dish. and that's what the monkey can for a single token. So everything costs one token  but as you can see  sometimes tokens buy more than others  sometimes more grapes than others. So I'll show you a quick video of what this marketplace actually looks like. Here's a monkey eye view. Monkeys are shorter  so it's a little short. But here's Honey. She's waiting for the market to open a little impatiently. All of a sudden the market opens. Here's her choice  one grapes or two grapes. You can see Honey  very good market economist  goes with the guy who gives more. She could teach our financial advisers a few things or two. So not just Honey  most of the monkeys went with guys who had more. Most of the monkeys went with guys who had better food. When we introduced sales  we saw the monkeys paid attention to that. They really cared about their monkey token dollar. The more surprising thing was that when we collaborated with economists to actually look at the monkeys' data using economic tools  they basically matched  not just qualitatively  but quantitatively with what we saw humans doing in a real market. So much so that  if you saw the monkeys' numbers  you couldn't tell whether they came from a monkey or a human in the same market. And what we'd really thought we'd done is like we'd actually introduced something that  at least for the monkeys and us  works like a real financial currency. Question is  do the monkeys start messing up in the same ways we do  Well  we already saw anecdotally a couple of signs that they might. One thing we never saw in the monkey marketplace was any evidence of saving    you know  just like our own species. The monkeys entered the market  spent their entire budget and then went back to everyone else. The other thing we also spontaneously saw  embarrassingly enough  is spontaneous evidence of larceny. The monkeys would rip off the tokens at every available opportunity    from each other  often from us    you know  things we didn't necessarily think we were introducing  but things we spontaneously saw. So we said  this looks bad. Can we actually see if the monkeys are doing exactly the same dumb things as humans do  One possibility is just kind of let the monkey financial system play out  you know  see if they start calling us for bailouts in a few years. We were a little impatient so we wanted to sort of speed things up a bit. So we said  let's actually give the monkeys the same kinds of problems that humans tend to get wrong in certain kinds of economic challenges  or certain kinds of economic experiments. And so  since the best way to see how people go wrong is to actually do it yourself  I'm going to give you guys a quick experiment to sort of watch your own financial intuitions in action. So imagine that right now I handed each and every one of you a thousand U.S. dollars    so    crisp hundred dollar bills. Take these  put it in your wallet and spend a second thinking about what you're going to do with it. Because it's yours now  you can buy whatever you want. Donate it  take it  and so on. Sounds great  but you get one more choice to earn a little bit more money. And here's your choice  you can either be risky  in which case I'm going to flip one of these monkey tokens. If it comes up heads  you're going to get a thousand dollars more. If it comes up tails  you get nothing. So it's a chance to get more  but it's pretty risky. Your other option is a bit safe. Your just going to get some money for sure. I'm just going to give you     bucks. You can stick it in your wallet and use it immediately. So see what your intuition is here. Most people actually go with the play it safe option. Most people say  why should I be risky when I can get       dollars for sure  This seems like a good bet. I'm going to go with that. You might say  eh  that's not really irrational. People are a little risk averse. So what  Well  the  so what   comes when start thinking about the same problem set up just a little bit differently. So now imagine that I give each and every one of you       dollars       crisp hundred dollar bills. Now you can buy double to stuff you were going to get before. Think about how you'd feel sticking it in your wallet. And now imagine that I have you make another choice But this time  it's a little bit worse. Now  you're going to be deciding how you're going to lose money  but you're going to get the same choice. You can either take a risky loss    so I'll flip a coin. If it comes up heads  you're going to actually lose a lot. If it comes up tails  you lose nothing  you're fine  get to keep the whole thing    or you could play it safe  which means you have to reach back into your wallet and give me five of those      bills  for certain. And I'm seeing a lot of furrowed brows out there. So maybe you're having the same intuitions as the subjects that were actually tested in this  which is when presented with these options  people don't choose to play it safe. They actually tend to go a little risky. The reason this is irrational is that we've given people in both situations the same choice. It's a       shot of a thousand or        or just       dollars with certainty. But people's intuitions about how much risk to take varies depending on where they started with. So what's going on  Well  it turns out that this seems to be the result of at least two biases that we have at the psychological level. One is that we have a really hard time thinking in absolute terms. You really have to do work to figure out  well  one option's a thousand         one is      . Instead  we find it very easy to think in very relative terms as options change from one time to another. So we think of things as   Oh  I'm going to get more   or  Oh  I'm going to get less.  This is all well and good  except that changes in different directions actually effect whether or not we think options are good or not. And this leads to the second bias  which economists have called loss aversion. The idea is that we really hate it when things go into the red. We really hate it when we have to lose out on some money. And this means that sometimes we'll actually switch our preferences to avoid this. What you saw in that last scenario is that subjects get risky because they want the small shot that there won't be any loss. That means when we're in a risk mindset    excuse me  when we're in a loss mindset  we actually become more risky  which can actually be really worrying. These kinds of things play out in lots of bad ways in humans. They're why stock investors hold onto losing stocks longer    because they're evaluating them in relative terms. They're why people in the housing market refused to sell their house    because they don't want to sell at a loss. The question we were interested in is whether the monkeys show the same biases. If we set up those same scenarios in our little monkey market  would they do the same thing as people  And so this is what we did  we gave the monkeys choices between guys who were safe    they did the same thing every time    or guys who were risky    they did things differently half the time. And then we gave them options that were bonuses    like you guys did in the first scenario    so they actually have a chance more  or pieces where they were experiencing losses    they actually thought they were going to get more than they really got. And so this is what this looks like. We introduced the monkeys to two new monkey salesmen. The guy on the left and right both start with one piece of grape  so it looks pretty good. But they're going to give the monkeys bonuses. The guy on the left is a safe bonus. All the time  he adds one  to give the monkeys two. The guy on the right is actually a risky bonus. Sometimes the monkeys get no bonus    so this is a bonus of zero. Sometimes the monkeys get two extra. For a big bonus  now they get three. But this is the same choice you guys just faced. Do the monkeys actually want to play it safe and then go with the guy who's going to do the same thing on every trial  or do they want to be risky and try to get a risky  but big  bonus  but risk the possibility of getting no bonus. People here played it safe. Turns out  the monkeys play it safe too. Qualitatively and quantitatively  they choose exactly the same way as people  when tested in the same thing. You might say  well  maybe the monkeys just don't like risk. Maybe we should see how they do with losses. And so we ran a second version of this. Now  the monkeys meet two guys who aren't giving them bonuses  they're actually giving them less than they expect. So they look like they're starting out with a big amount. These are three grapes  the monkey's really psyched for this. But now they learn these guys are going to give them less than they expect. They guy on the left is a safe loss. Every single time  he's going to take one of these away and give the monkeys just two. the guy on the right is the risky loss. Sometimes he gives no loss  so the monkeys are really psyched  but sometimes he actually gives a big loss  taking away two to give the monkeys only one. And so what do the monkeys do  Again  same choice  they can play it safe for always getting two grapes every single time  or they can take a risky bet and choose between one and three. The remarkable thing to us is that  when you give monkeys this choice  they do the same irrational thing that people do. They actually become more risky depending on how the experimenters started. This is crazy because it suggests that the monkeys too are evaluating things in relative terms and actually treating losses differently than they treat gains. So what does all of this mean  Well  what we've shown is that  first of all  we can actually give the monkeys a financial currency  and they do very similar things with it. They do some of the smart things we do  some of the kind of not so nice things we do  like steal it and so on. But they also do some of the irrational things we do. They systematically get things wrong and in the same ways that we do. This is the first take home message of the Talk  which is that if you saw the beginning of this and you thought  oh  I'm totally going to go home and hire a capuchin monkey financial adviser. They're way cuter than the one at ... you know    Don't do that  they're probably going to be just as dumb as the human one you already have. So  you know  a little bad    Sorry  sorry  sorry. A little bad for monkey investors. But of course  you know  the reason you're laughing is bad for humans too. Because we've answered the question we started out with. We wanted to know where these kinds of errors came from. And we started with the hope that maybe we can sort of tweak our financial institutions  tweak our technologies to make ourselves better. But what we've learn is that these biases might be a deeper part of us than that. In fact  they might be due to the very nature of our evolutionary history. You know  maybe it's not just humans at the right side of this chain that's duncey. Maybe it's sort of duncey all the way back. And this  if we believe the capuchin monkey results  means that these duncey strategies might be    million years old. That's a long time for a strategy to potentially get changed around    really  really old. What do we know about other old strategies like this  Well  one thing we know is that they tend to be really hard to overcome. You know  think of our evolutionary predilection for eating sweet things  fatty things like cheesecake. You can't just shut that off. You can't just look at the dessert cart as say   No  no  no. That looks disgusting to me.  We're just built differently. We're going to perceive it as a good thing to go after. My guess is that the same thing is going to be true when humans are perceiving different financial decisions. When you're watching your stocks plummet into the red  when you're watching your house price go down  you're not going to be able to see that in anything but old evolutionary terms. This means that the biases that lead investors to do badly  that lead to the foreclosure crisis are going to be really hard to overcome. So that's the bad news. The question is  is there any good news  I'm supposed to be up here telling you the good news. Well  the good news  I think  is what I started with at the beginning of the Talk  which is that humans are not only smart  we're really inspirationally smart to the rest of the animals in the biological kingdom. We're so good at overcoming our biological limitations    you know  I flew over here in an airplane. I didn't have to try to flap my wings. I'm wearing contact lenses now so that I can see all of you. I don't have to rely on my own near sightedness. We actually have all of these cases where we overcome our biological limitations through technology and other means  seemingly pretty easily. But we have to recognize that we have those limitations. And here's the rub. It was Camus who once said that   Man is the only species who refuses to be what he really is.  But the irony is that it might only be in recognizing our limitations that we can really actually overcome them. The hope is that you all will think about your limitations  not necessarily as unovercomable  but to recognize them  accept them and then use the world of design to actually figure them out. That might be the only way that we will really be able to achieve our own human potential and really be the noble species we hope to all be. Thank you. Last year when I was here  I was speaking to you about a swim which I did across the North Pole. And while that swim took place three years ago  I can remember it as if it was yesterday. I remember standing on the edge of the ice  about to dive into the water  and thinking to myself  I have never ever seen any place on this earth which is just so frightening. The water is completely black. The water is minus  .  degrees centigrade  or    degrees Fahrenheit. It's flipping freezing in that water. And then a thought came across my mind  if things go pear shaped on this swim  how long will it take for my frozen body to sink the four and a half kilometers to the bottom of the ocean  And then I said to myself  I've just got to get this thought out of my mind as quickly as possible. And the only way I can dive into that freezing cold water and swim a kilometer is by listening to my iPod and really revving myself up  listening to everything from beautiful opera all the way across to Puff Daddy  and then committing myself a hundred percent    there is nothing more powerful than the made up mind    and then walking up to the edge of the ice and just diving into the water. And that swim took me    minutes and    seconds  and it felt like    days. And I remember getting out of the water and my hands feeling so painful and looking down at my fingers  and my fingers were literally the size of sausages because    you know  we're made partially of water    when water freezes it expands  and so the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded and burst. And the most immediate thought when I came out of that water was the following  I'm never  ever going to do another cold water swim in my life again. Anyway  last year  I heard about the Himalayas and the melting of the     Laughter  and the melting of the glaciers because of climate change. I heard about this lake  Lake Imja. This lake has been formed in the last couple of years because of the melting of the glacier. The glacier's gone all the way up the mountain and left in its place this big lake. And I firmly believe that what we're seeing in the Himalayas is the next great  big battleground on this earth. Nearly two billion people    so one in three people on this earth    rely on the water from the Himalayas. And with a population increasing as quickly as it is  and with the water supply from these glaciers    because of climate change    decreasing so much  I think we have a real risk of instability. North  you've got China  south  you've India  Pakistan  Bangladesh  all these countries. And so I decided to walk up to Mt. Everest  the highest mountain on this earth  and go and do a symbolic swim underneath the summit of Mt. Everest. Now  I don't know if any of you have had the opportunity to go to Mt. Everest  but it's quite an ordeal getting up there.    great  big  powerful yaks carrying all the equipment up onto this mountain    I don't just have my Speedo  but there's a big film crew who then send all the images around the world. The other thing which was so challenging about this swim is not just the altitude. I wanted to do the swim at       meters above sea level. So it's right up in the heavens. It's very  very difficult to breath. You get altitude sickness. I feels like you've got a man standing behind you with a hammer just hitting your head all the time. That's not the worst part of it. The worst part was this year was the year where they decided to do a big cleanup operation on Mt. Everest. Many  many people have died on Mt. Everest  and this was the year they decided to go and recover all the bodies of the mountaineers and then bring them down the mountain. And when you're walking up the mountain to attempt to do something which no human has ever done before  and  in fact  no fish    there are no fish up there swimming at       meters    When you're trying to do that  and then the bodies are coming past you  it humbles you  and you also realize very  very clearly that nature is so much more powerful than we are. And we walked up this pathway  all the way up. And to the right hand side of us was this great Khumbu Glacier. And all the way along the glacier we saw these big pools of melting ice. And then we got up to this small lake underneath the summit of Mt. Everest  and I prepared myself the same way as I've always prepared myself  for this swim which was going to be so very difficult. I put on my iPod  I listened to some music  I got myself as aggressive as possible    but controlled aggression    and then I hurled myself into that water. I swam as quickly as I could for the first hundred meters  and then I realized very  very quickly  I had a huge problem on my hands. I could barely breathe. I was gasping for air. I then began to choke  and then it quickly led to me vomiting in the water. And it all happened so quickly  I then    I don't know how it happened    but I went underwater. And luckily  the water was quite shallow  and I was able to push myself off the bottom of the lake and get up and then take another gasp of air. And then I said  carry on. Carry on. Carry on. I carried on for another five or six strokes  and then I had nothing in my body  and I went down to the bottom of the lake. And I don't where I got it from  but I was able to somehow pull myself up and as quickly as possible get to the side of the lake. I've heard it said that drowning is the most peaceful death that you can have. I have never  ever heard such utter bollocks. It is the most frightening and panicky feeling that you can have. I got myself to the side of the lake. My crew grabbed me  and then we walked as quickly as we could down    over the rubble    down to our camp. And there  we sat down  and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong there on Mt. Everest. And my team just gave it to me straight. They said  Lewis  you need to have a radical tactical shift if you want to do this swim. Every single thing which you have learned in the past    years of swimming  you must forget. Every single thing which you learned when you were serving in the British army  about speed and aggression  you put that to one side. We want you to walk up the hill in another two days' time. Take some time to rest and think about things. We want you to walk up the mountain in two days' time  and instead of swimming fast  swim as slowly as possible. Instead of swimming crawl  swim breaststroke. And remember  never ever swim with aggression. This is the time to swim with real humility. And so we walked back up to the mountain two days later. And I stood there on the edge of the lake  and I looked up at Mt. Everest    and she is one of the most beautiful mountains on the earth    and I said to myself  just do this slowly. And I swam across the lake. And I can't begin to tell you how good I felt when I came to the other side. But I learned two very  very important lessons there on Mt. Everest  and I thank my team of Sherpas who taught me this. The first one is that just because something has worked in the past so well  doesn't mean it's going to work in the future. And similarly  now  before I do anything  I ask myself what type of mindset do I require to successfully complete a task. And taking that into the world of climate change    which is  frankly  the Mt. Everest of all problems    just because we've lived the way we have lived for so long  just because we have consumed the way we have for so long and populated the earth the way we have for so long  doesn't mean that we can carry on the way we are carrying on. The warning signs are all there. When I was born  the world's population was  .  billion people. We're now  .  billion people  and we're expected to be   billion people by     . And then the second lesson  the radical  tactical shift. And I've come here to ask you today  what radical tactical shift can you take in your relationship to the environment  which will ensure that our children and our grandchildren live in a safe world and a secure world  and most importantly  in a sustainable world  And I ask you  please  to go away from here and think about that one radical tactical shift which you could make  which will make that big difference  and then commit a hundred percent to doing it. Blog about it  tweet about it  talk about it  and commit a hundred percent  because very  very few things are impossible to achieve if we really put our whole minds to it. So thank you very  very much. I grew up on a small farm in Missouri. We lived on less than a dollar a day for about    years. I got a scholarship  went to university  studied international agriculture  studied anthropology  and decided I was going to give back. I was going to work with small farmers. I was going to help alleviate poverty. I was going to work on international development  and then I took a turn and ended up here. Now  if you get a Ph.D.  and you decide not to teach  you don't always end up in a place like this. It's a choice. You might end up driving a taxicab. You could be in New York. What I found was  I started working with refugees and famine victims    small farmers  all  or nearly all    who had been dispossessed and displaced. Now  what I'd been trained to do was methodological research on such people. So I did it  I found out how many women had been raped en route to these camps. I found out how many people had been put in jail  how many family members had been killed. I assessed how long they were going to stay and how much it would take to feed them. And I got really good at predicting how many body bags you would need for the people who were going to die in these camps. Now this is God's work  but it's not my work. It's not the work I set out to do. So I was at a Grateful Dead benefit concert on the rainforests in     . I met a guy    the guy on the left. His name was Ben. He said   What can I do to save the rainforests   I said   Well  Ben  what do you do    I make ice cream.  So I said   Well  you've got to make a rainforest ice cream. And you've got to use nuts from the rainforests to show that forests are worth more as forests than they are as pasture.  He said   Okay.  Within a year  Rainforest Crunch was on the shelves. It was a great success. We did our first million dollars worth of trade by buying on    days and selling on   . That gets your adrenaline going. Then we had a four and a half million dollar line of credit because we were credit worthy at that point. We had    to     maybe    percent of the global Brazil nut market. We paid two to three times more than anybody else. Everybody else raised their prices to the gatherers of Brazil nuts because we would buy it otherwise. A great success.    companies signed up      products came out  generated     million in sales. It failed. Why did it fail  Because the people who were gathering Brazil nuts weren't the same people who were cutting the forests. And the people who made money from Brazil nuts were not the people who made money from cutting the forests. We were attacking the wrong driver. We needed to be working on beef. We needed to be working on lumber. We needed to be working on soy    things that we were not focused on. So let's go back to Sudan. I often talk to refugees   Why was it that the West didn't realize that famines are caused by policies and politics  not by weather   And this farmer said to me  one day  something that was very profound. He said   You can't wake a person who's pretending to sleep.  Okay. Fast forward. We live on a planet. There's just one of them. We've got to wake up to the fact that we don't have any more and that this is a finite planet. We know the limits of the resources we have. We may be able to use them differently. We may have some innovative  new ideas. But in general  this is what we've got. There's no more of it. There's a basic equation that we can't get away from. Population times consumption has got to have some kind of relationship to the planet  and right now  it's a simple  not equal.  Our work shows that we're living at about  .  planets. Since       we crossed the line of being in a sustainable relationship to the planet. Now we're at  . . If we were farmers  we'd be eating our seed. For bankers  we'd be living off the principal  not the interest. This is where we stand today. A lot of people like to point to some place else as the cause of the problem. It's always population growth. Population growth's important  but it's also about how much each person consumes. So when the average American consumes    times as much as the average African  we've got to think that consumption is an issue. It's not just about population  and it's not just about them  it's about us. But it's not just about people  it's about lifestyles. There's very good evidence    again  we don't necessarily have a peer reviewed methodology that's bulletproof yet    but there's very good evidence that the average cat in Europe has a larger environmental footprint in its lifetime than the average African. You think that's not an issue going forward  You think that's not a question as to how we should be using the Earth's resources  Let's go back and visit our equation. In       we had six billion people on the planet. They were consuming what they were consuming    let's say one unit of consumption each. We have six billion units of consumption. By       we're going to have nine billion people    all the scientists agree. They're all going to consume twice as much as they currently do    scientists  again  agree    because income is going to grow in developing countries five times what it is today    on global average  about   .  . So we're going to have    billion units of consumption. Who have you heard talking lately that's said we have to triple production of goods and services  But that's what the math says. We're not going to be able to do that. We can get productivity up. We can get efficiency up. But we've also got to get consumption down. We need to use less to make more. And then we need to use less again. And then we need to consume less. All of those things are part of that equation. But it basically raises a fundamental question  should consumers have a choice about sustainability  about sustainable products  Should you be able to buy a product that's sustainable sitting next to one that isn't  or should all the products on the shelf be sustainable  If they should all be sustainable on a finite planet  how do you make that happen  The average consumer takes  .  seconds in the U.S. Okay  so let's be generous. Let's say it's  .  seconds in Europe. How do you evaluate all the scientific data around a product  the data that's changing on a weekly  if not a daily  basis  How do you get informed  You don't. Here's a little question. From a greenhouse gas perspective  is lamb produced in the U.K. better than lamb produced in New Zealand  frozen and shipped to the U.K.  Is a bad feeder lot operation for beef better or worse than a bad grazing operation for beef  Do organic potatoes actually have fewer toxic chemicals used to produce them than conventional potatoes  In every single case  the answer is  it depends.  It depends on who produced it and how  in every single instance. And there are many others. How is a consumer going to walk through this minefield  They're not. They may have a lot of opinions about it  but they're not going to be terribly informed. Sustainability has got to be a pre competitive issue. It's got to be something we all care about. And we need collusion. We need groups to work together that never have. We need Cargill to work with Bunge. We need Coke to work with Pepsi. We need Oxford to work with Cambridge. We need Greenpeace to work with WWF. Everybody's got to work together    China and the U.S. We need to begin to manage this planet as if our life depended on it  because it does  it fundamentally does. But we can't do everything. Even if we get everybody working on it  we've got to be strategic. We need to focus on the where  the what and the who. So  the where  We've identified    places globally that we need to work. These are the places that are the richest in biodiversity and the most important from an ecosystem function point of view. We have to work in these places. We have to save these places if we want a chance in hell of preserving biodiversity as we know it. We looked at the threats to these places. These are the    commodities that fundamentally pose the biggest threats to these places because of deforestation  soil loss  water use  pesticide use  over fishing  etc. So we've got    places  we've got    priority commodities  who do we work with to change the way those commodities are produced  Are we going to work with  .  billion consumers  Let's see  that's about       languages      major languages    a lot of work there. I don't see anybody actually being able to do that very effectively. Are we going to work with  .  billion producers  Again  a daunting task. There must be a better way.     to     companies control    percent or more of the trade of each of the    commodities that we've identified as the most significant. If we work with those  if we change those companies and the way they do business  then the rest will happen automatically. So  we went through our    commodities. This is nine of them. We lined them up side by side  and we put the names of the companies that work on each of those. And if you go through the first    or    names of each of the commodities  what you begin to see is  gosh  there's Cargill here  there's Cargill there  there's Cargill everywhere. In fact  these names start coming up over and over again. So we did the analysis again a slightly different way. We said  if we take the top hundred companies  what percentage of all    commodities do they touch  buy or sell  And what we found is it's    percent. So     companies control    percent of the trade of all    of the most significant commodities on the planet. We can get our arms around a hundred companies. A hundred companies  we can work with. Why is    percent important  Because if these companies demand sustainable products  they'll pull    to    percent of production. Companies can push producers faster than consumers can. By companies asking for this  we can leverage production so much faster than by waiting for consumers to do it. After    years  the global organic movement has achieved  .  of one percent of global food. We can't wait that long. We don't have that kind of time. We need change that's going to accelerate. Even working with individual companies is not probably going to get us there. We need to begin to work with industries. So we've started roundtables where we bring together the entire value chain  from producers all the way to the retailers and brands. We bring in civil society  we bring in NGOs  we bring in researchers and scientists to have an informed discussion    sometimes a battle royale    to figure out what are the key impacts of these products  what is a global benchmark  what's an acceptable impact  and design standards around that. It's not all fun and games. In salmon aquaculture  we kicked off a roundtable almost six years ago. Eight entities came to the table. We eventually got  I think     percent of global production at the table and    percent of demand at the table. Three of the original eight entities were suing each other. And yet  next week  we launch globally verified  vetted and certified standards for salmon aquaculture. It can happen. So what brings the different entities to the table  It's risk and demand. For the big companies  it's reputational risk  but more importantly  they don't care what the price of commodities is. If they don't have commodities  they don't have a business. They care about availability  so the big risk for them is not having product at all. For the producers  if a buyer wants to buy something produced a certain way  that's what brings them to the table. So it's the demand that brings them to the table. The good news is we identified a hundred companies two years ago. In the last    months  we've signed agreements with    of those hundred companies to begin to work with them on their supply chain. And in the next    months  we will have signed up to work with another     and we think we'll get those signed as well. Now what we're doing is bringing the CEOs of these    companies together to help twist the arms of the final     to bring them to the table  because they don't like NGOs  they've never worked with NGOs  they're concerned about this  they're concerned about that  but we all need to be in this together. So we're pulling out all the stops. We're using whatever leverage we have to bring them to the table. One company we're working with that's begun    in baby steps  perhaps    but has begun this journey on sustainability is Cargill. They've funded research that shows that we can double global palm oil production without cutting a single tree in the next    years  and do it all in Borneo alone by planting on land that's already degraded. The study shows that the highest net present value for palm oil is on land that's been degraded. They're also undertaking a study to look at all of their supplies of palm oil to see if they could be certified and what they would need to change in order to become third party certified under a credible certification program. Why is Cargill important  Because Cargill has    to    percent of global palm oil. If Cargill makes a decision  the entire palm oil industry moves  or at least    or    percent of it. That's not insignificant. More importantly  Cargill and one other company ship    percent of the palm oil that goes to China. We don't have to change the way a single Chinese company works if we get Cargill to only send sustainable palm oil to China. It's a pre competitive issue. All the palm oil going there is good. Buy it. Mars is also on a similar journey. Now most people understand that Mars is a chocolate company  but Mars has made sustainability pledges to buy only certified product for all of its seafood. It turns out Mars buys more seafood than Walmart because of pet food. But they're doing some really interesting things around chocolate  and it all comes from the fact that Mars wants to be in business in the future. And what they see is that they need to improve chocolate production. On any given plantation     percent of the trees produce    percent of the crop  so Mars is looking at the genome  they're sequencing the genome of the cocoa plant. They're doing it with IBM and the USDA  and they're putting it in the public domain because they want everybody to have access to this data  because they want everybody to help them make cocoa more productive and more sustainable. What they've realized is that if they can identify the traits on productivity and drought tolerance  they can produce     percent as much cocoa on    percent of the land. The rest of the land can be used for something else. It's more with less and less again. That's what the future has got to be  and putting it in the public domain is smart. They don't want to be an I.P. company  they want to be a chocolate company  but they want to be a chocolate company forever. Now  the price of food  many people complain about  but in fact  the price of food is going down  and that's odd because in fact  consumers are not paying for the true cost of food. If you take a look just at water  what we see is that  with four very common products  you look at how much a farmer produced to make those products  and then you look at how much water input was put into them  and then you look at what the farmer was paid. If you divide the amount of water into what the farmer was paid  the farmer didn't receive enough money to pay a decent price for water in any of those commodities. That is an externality by definition. This is the subsidy from nature. Coca Cola  they've worked a lot on water  but right now  they're entering into    year contracts with growers in Turkey to sell juice into Europe  and they're doing that because they want to have a product that's closer to the European market. But they're not just buying the juice  they're also buying the carbon in the trees to offset the shipment costs associated with carbon to get the product into Europe. There's carbon that's being bought with sugar  with coffee  with beef. This is called bundling. It's bringing those externalities back into the price of the commodity. We need to take what we've learned in private  voluntary standards of what the best producers in the world are doing and use that to inform government regulation  so we can shift the entire performance curve. We can't just focus on identifying the best  we've got to move the rest. The issue isn't what to think  it's how to think. These companies have begun to think differently. They're on a journey  there's no turning back. We're all on that same journey with them. We have to really begin to change the way we think about everything. Whatever was sustainable on a planet of six billion is not going to be sustainable on a planet with nine. Thank you. The global challenge that I want to talk to you about today rarely makes the front pages. It  however  is enormous in both scale and importance. Look  you all are very well traveled  this is TEDGlobal after all. But I do hope to take you to some places you've never been to before. So  let's start off in China. This photo was taken two weeks ago. Actually  one indication is that little boy on my husband's shoulders has just graduated from high school. But this is Tiananmen Square. Many of you have been there. It's not the real China. Let me take you to the real China. This is in the Dabian Mountains in the remote part of Hubei province in central China. Dai Manju is    years old at the time the story starts. She lives with her parents  her two brothers and her great aunt. They have a hut that has no electricity  no running water  no wristwatch  no bicycle. And they share this great splendor with a very large pig. Dai Manju was in sixth grade when her parents said   We're going to pull you out of school because the    dollar school fees are too much for us. You're going to be spending the rest of your life in the rice paddies. Why would we waste this money on you   This is what happens to girls in remote areas. Turns out that Dai Manju was the best pupil in her grade. She still made the two hour trek to the schoolhouse and tried to catch every little bit of information that seeped out of the doors. We wrote about her in The New York Times. We got a flood of donations    mostly    dollar checks because New York Times readers are very generous in tiny amounts but then  we got a money transfer for            really nice guy. We turned the money over to that man there  the principal of the school. He was delighted. He thought   Oh  I can renovate the school. I can give scholarships to all the girls  you know  if they work hard and stay in school. So Dai Manju basically finished out middle school. She went to high school. She went to vocational school for accounting. She scouted for jobs down in Guangdong province in the south. She found a job  she scouted for jobs for her classmates and her friends. She sent money back to her family. They built a new house  this time with running water  electricity  a bicycle  no pig. What we saw was a natural experiment. It is rare to get an exogenous investment in girls' education. And over the years  as we followed Dai Manju  we were able to see that she was able to move out of a vicious cycle and into a virtuous cycle. She not only changed her own dynamic  she changed her household  she changed her family  her village. The village became a real standout. Of course  most of China was flourishing at the time  but they were able to get a road built to link them up to the rest of China. And that brings me to my first major of two tenets of  Half the Sky.  And that is that the central moral challenge of this century is gender inequity. In the   th century  it was slavery. In the   th century  it was totalitarianism. The cause of our time is the brutality that so many people face around the world because of their gender. So some of you may be thinking   Gosh  that's hyperbole. She's exaggerating.  Well  let me ask you this question. How many of you think there are more males or more females in the world  Let me take a poll. How many of you think there are more males in the world  Hands up  please. How many of you think    a few    how many of you there are more females in the world  Okay  most of you. Well  you know this latter group  you're wrong. There are  true enough  in Europe and the West  when women and men have equal access to food and health care  there are more women  we live longer. But in most of the rest of the world  that's not the case. In fact  demographers have shown that there are anywhere between    million and     million missing females in the current population. And  you know  it happens for several reasons. For instance  in the last half century  more girls were discriminated to death than all the people killed on all the battlefields in the   th century. Sometimes it's also because of the sonogram. Girls get aborted before they're even born when there are scarce resources. This girl here  for instance  is in a feeding center in Ethiopia. The entire center was filled with girls like her. What's remarkable is that her brothers  in the same family  were totally fine. In India  in the first year of life  from zero to one  boy and girl babies basically survive at the same rate because they depend upon the breast  and the breast shows no son preference. From one to five  girls die at a    percent higher mortality rate than boys  in all of India. The second tenet of  Half the Sky  is that  let's put aside the morality of all the right and wrong of it all  and just on a purely practical level  we think that one of the best ways to fight poverty and to fight terrorism is to educate girls and to bring women into the formal labor force. Poverty  for instance. There are three reasons why this is the case. For one  overpopulation is one of the persistent causes of poverty. And you know  when you educate a boy  his family tends to have fewer kids  but only slightly. When you educate a girl  she tends to have significantly fewer kids. The second reason is it has to do with spending. It's kind of like the dirty  little secret of poverty  which is that  not only do poor people take in very little income  but also  the income that they take in  they don't spend it very wisely  and unfortunately  most of that spending is done by men. So research has shown  if you look at people who live under two dollars a day    one metric of poverty    two percent of that take home pay goes to this basket here  in education.    percent goes to a basket that is a combination of alcohol  tobacco  sugary drinks    and prostitution and festivals. If you just take four percentage points and put it into this basket  you would have a transformative effect. The last reason has to do with women being part of the solution  not the problem. You need to use scarce resources. It's a waste of resources if you don't use someone like Dai Manju. Bill Gates put it very well when he was traveling through Saudi Arabia. He was speaking to an audience much like yourselves. However  two thirds of the way there was a barrier. On this side was men  and then the barrier  and this side was women. And someone from this side of the room got up and said   Mr. Gates  we have here as our goal in Saudi Arabia to be one of the top    countries when it comes to technology. Do you think we'll make it   So Bill Gates  as he was staring out at the audience  he said   If you're not fully utilizing half the resources in your country  there is no way you will get anywhere near the top   .  So here is Bill of Arabia. So what would some of the specific challenges look like  I would say  on the top of the agenda is sex trafficking. And I'll just say two things about this. The slavery at the peak of the slave trade in the     s  there were about        slaves transported from Africa to the New World. Now  modern slavery  according to State Department rough statistics  there are about               times the number    that are trafficked across international borders. And that does not even include those that are trafficked within country borders  which is a substantial portion. And if you look at another factor  another contrast  a slave back then is worth about         in today's money. Today  you can buy a girl trafficked for a few hundred dollars  which means she's actually more disposable. But you know  there is progress being made in places like Cambodia and Thailand. We don't have to expect a world where girls are bought and sold or killed. The second item on the agenda is maternal mortality. You know  childbirth in this part of the world is a wonderful event. In Niger  one in seven women can expect to die during childbirth. Around the world  one woman dies every minute and a half from childbirth. You know  it's not as though we don't have the technological solution  but these women have three strikes against them  they are poor  they are rural and they are female. You know  for every woman who does die  there are    who survive but end up with an injury. And the most devastating injury is obstetric fistula. It's a tearing during obstructed labor that leaves a woman incontinent. Let me tell you about Mahabuba. She lives in Ethiopia. She was married against her will at age   . She got pregnant  ran to the bush to have the baby  but you know  her body was very immature  and she ended up having obstructed labor. The baby died  and she ended up with a fistula. So that meant she was incontinent  she couldn't control her wastes. In a word  she stank. The villagers thought she was cursed  they didn't know what to do with her. So finally  they put her at the edge of the village in a hut. They ripped off the door so that the hyenas would get her at night. That night  there was a stick in the hut. She fought off the hyenas with that stick. And the next morning  she knew if she could get to a nearby village where there was a foreign missionary  she would be saved. Because she had some damage to her nerves  she crawled all the way       miles    to that doorstep  half dead. The foreign missionary opened the door  knew exactly what had happened  took her to a nearby fistula hospital in Addis Ababa  and she was repaired with a     dollar operation. The doctors and nurses there noticed that she was not only a survivor  she was really clever  and they made her a nurse. So now  Mahabuba  she is saving the lives of hundreds  thousands  of women. She has become part of the solution  not the problem. She's moved out of a vicious cycle and into a virtuous cycle. I've talked about some of the challenges  let me talk about some of the solutions  and there are predictable solutions. I've hinted at them  education and also economic opportunity. So of course  when you educate a girl  she tends to get married later on in life  she tends to have kids later on in life  she tends to have fewer kids  and those kids that she does have  she educates them in a more enlightened fashion. With economic opportunity  it can be transformative. Let me tell you about Saima. She lives in a small village outside Lahore  Pakistan. And at the time  she was miserable. She was beaten every single day by her husband  who was unemployed. He was kind of a gambler type    and unemployable  therefore    and took his frustrations out on her. Well  when she had her second daughter  her mother in law told her son   I think you'd better get a second wife. Saima's not going to produce you a son.  This is when she had her second daughter. At the time  there was a microlending group in the village that gave her a    dollar loan. Saima took that money  and she started an embroidery business. The merchants liked her embroidery  it sold very well  and they kept asking for more. And when she couldn't produce enough  she hired other women in the village. Pretty soon she had    women in the village working for her embroidery business. And then  when she had to transport all of the embroidery goods from the village to the marketplace  she needed someone to help her do the transport  so she hired her husband. So now they're in it together. He does the transportation and distribution  and she does the production and sourcing. And now they have a third daughter  and the daughters  all of them  are being tutored in education because Saima knows what's really important. Which brings me to the final element  which is education. Larry Summers  when he was chief economist at the World Bank  once said that   It may well be that the highest return on investment in the developing world is in girls' education.  Let me tell you about Beatrice Biira. Beatrice was living in Uganda near the Congo border  and like Dai Manju  she didn't go to school. Actually  she had never been to school  not to a lick  one day. Her parents  again  said   Why should we spend the money on her  She's going to spend most of her life lugging water back and forth.  Well  it just so happens  at that time  there was a group in Connecticut called the Niantic Community Church Group in Connecticut. They made a donation to an organization based in Arkansas called Heifer International. Heifer sent two goats to Africa. One of them ended up with Beatrice's parents  and that goat had twins. The twins started producing milk. They sold the milk for cash. The cash started accumulating  and pretty soon the parents said   You know  we've got enough money. Let's send Beatrice to school.  So at nine years of age  Beatrice started in first grade    after all  she'd never been to a lick of school    with a six year old. No matter  she was just delighted to be in school. She rocketed to the top of her class. She stayed at the top of her class through elementary school  middle school  and then in high school  she scored brilliantly on the national examinations so that she became the first person in her village  ever  to come to the United States on scholarship. Two years ago  she graduated from Connecticut College. On the day of her graduation  she said   I am the luckiest girl alive because of a goat.  And that goat was     . So you see how transformative little bits of help can be. But I want to give you a reality check. Look  U.S. aid  helping people is not easy  and there have been books that have criticized U.S. aid. There's Bill Easterly's book. There's a book called  Dead Aid.  You know  the criticism is fair  it isn't easy. You know  people say how half of all water well projects  a year later  are failed. When I was in Zimbabwe  we were touring a place with the village chief    he wanted to raise money for a secondary school    and there was some construction a few yards away  and I said   What's that   He sort of mumbled. Turns out that it's a failed irrigation project. A few yards away was a failed chicken coop. One year  all the chickens died  and no one wanted to put the chickens in there. It's true  but we think that you don't through the baby out with the bathwater  you actually improve. You learn from your mistakes  and you continuously improve. We also think that individuals can make a difference  and they should  because individuals  together  we can all help create a movement. And a movement of men and women is what's needed to bring about social change  change that will address this great moral challenge. So then  I ask  what's in it for you  You're probably asking that. Why should you care  I will just leave you with two things. One is that research shows that once you have all of your material needs taken care of    which most of us  all of us  here in this room do    research shows that there are very few things in life that can actually elevate your level of happiness. One of those things is contributing to a cause larger than yourself. And the second thing  it's an anecdote that I'll leave you with. And that is the story of an aid worker in Darfur. Here was a woman who had worked in Darfur  seeing things that no human being should see. Throughout her time there  she was strong  she was steadfast. She never broke down. And then she came back to the United States and was on break  Christmas break. She was in her grandmother's backyard  and she saw something that made her break down in tears. What that was was a bird feeder. And she realized that she had the great fortune to be born in a country where we take security for granted  where we not only can feed  clothe and house ourselves  but also provide for wild birds so they don't go hungry in the winter. And she realized that with that great fortune comes great responsibility. And so  like her  you  me  we have all won the lottery of life. And so the question becomes  how do we discharge that responsibility  So  here's the cause. Join the movement. Feel happier and help save the world. Thank you very much. When I saw a piece of technology called Kinect    it was called Natal    I was inspired  and I thought for a moment  maybe it's possible to address that one problem of storytelling  to create a character which seemed alive  which noticed me  that could look me in the eyes and feel real  and sculpt a story about our relationship. And so a year ago  I showed this off at a computer show called E . And this was a piece of technology with someone called Claire interacting with this boy. And there was a huge row online about   Hey  this can't be real.  And so I waited till now to have an actual demo of the real tech. Now  this tech incorporates three big elements. The first is a Kinect camera  which will be out in November  some incredible AI that was hidden in the dusty vaults  collecting dust in Microsoft  plus our quite crude attempts at AI at a company called Lionhead  mixing all those things together just to get to this one simple idea  to create a real  living being in a computer. Now  I'll be honest with you and say that most of it is just a trick  but it's a trick that actually works. So why don't we go over and have a look at the demo now. This is Dimitri. Dimitri  just waggle your arm around. Now  you notice he's sitting. There are no controllers  no keyboards  or mice  or joysticks  or joypads. He is just going to use his hand  his body and his voice  just like humans interact with their hands  body and voice. So let's move forward. You're going to meet Milo for the first time. We had to give him a problem because when we first created Milo  we realized that he came across as a little bit of a brat  to be honest with you. He was quite a know it all  and he wanted to kind of make you laugh. So the problem we introduced to him was this  he's just moved house. He's moved from London to New England  over in America. His parents are too busy to listen to his problems  and that's when he starts almost conjuring you up. So here he is walking through the grass. And you're able to interact with his world. The cool thing is  what we're doing is we're changing the mind of Milo constantly. That means no two people's Milos can be the same. You're actually sculpting a human being here. So  he's discovering the garden. You're helping him discover the garden by just pointing out these snails. Very simple at the start. By the way  if you are a boy  it's snails  if you're a girl  it's butterflies because what we found was that girls hate snails. So remember  this is the first time you've met him  and we really want to draw you in and make you more curious. His face  by the way  is fully AI driven. We have complete control over his blush responses  the diameter of his nostrils to denote stress. We actually do something called body matching. If you're leaning forward  he will try and slightly change the neuro linguistic nature of his face  because we went out with this strong idea  how can we make you believe that something's real  Now we've used the hand. The other thing to use is your body. Why not just  instead of pushing left and right with a mouse or with a joypad  why not use your body just to lean on the chair    again  relaxed  You can lean back  but the camera will change its perspective depending on which way you're looking. So Dimitri's now going to use    he's used his hand  he's used his body. He's now going to use the other thing which is essential  and that's his voice. Now  the thing about voice is  our experience with voice recognition is pretty awful  isn't it  It never works. You order an airline ticket  you end up in Timbuktu. So we've tackled that problem  and we've come up with a solution  which we'll see in a second. Milo  I could just squish it. Peter Molyneux  What are you going to do  Dimitri  Female Voice  Squashing a snail may not seem important  but remember  even this choice will affect how Milo develops. Do you want Milo to squash it  When you see the microphone  say ...  PM  Squash.  ... yes to decide. Dimitri  Go on  Milo. Squash it. PM  No. That's the wrong thing to do. Now look at his response. He said   Go on  Milo. Squash it.  What we're using there is  we're using something  a piece of technology called Tellme. It's a company that Microsoft acquired some years ago. We've got a database of words which we recognize. We pick those words out. We also reference that with the tonation database that we build up of Dimitri's voice  or the user's voice. Now we need to have a bit more engagement  and again  what we can do is we can look at the body. And we'll do that in a second. Milo  I wonder how deep it is. Deep. PM  Okay. So what we're going to do now is teach Milo to skim stones. We're actually teaching him. It's very  very interesting that men  more than women  tend to be more competitive here. They're fine with teaching Milo for the first few throws  but then they want to beat Milo  where women  they're more nurturing about this. Okay  this is skimming stones. How do you skim stones  You stand up  and you skim the stone. It's that simple. Just recognizing your body  recognizing the body's motions  the tech  understanding that you've gone from sitting down to standing up. Again  all of this is done in the way us humans do things  and that's crucially important if we want Milo to appear real. Female Voice  See if you can inspire him to do any better. Try hitting the boat. Milo  Ahhh. So close. PM  That's Dimitri at his most competitive. Now beaten an    year old child. Well done. Milo  Okay. PM  So  Milo's being called back in by his parents  giving us time to be alone and to help him out. Basically    the bit that we missed at the start    his parents had asked him to clean up his room. And we're going to help him with this now. But this is going to be an introduction  and this is all about the deep psychology that we're trying to use. We're trying to introduce you to what I believe is the most wonderful part  you being able to talk in your natural voice to Milo. Now  to do that  we needed a set up  like a magician's trick. And what we did was  we needed to give Milo this big problem. So as Dimitri starts tidying up  you can overhear a conversation that Milo's having with his parents. Milo's Mom  Oh  you've got gravy all over the floor.  Milo  I didn't mean to   Milo's Mom  That carpet is brand new. PM  So he's just spilled a plate of sausages on the floor  on the brand new carpet. We've all done it as parents  we've all done it as children. Now's a chance for Dimitri to kind of reassure and calm Milo down. It's all been too much for him. He's just moved house. He's got no friends. Now is the time when we open that portal and allow you to talk to Milo. Female Voice  Why don't you try saying something encouraging to cheer Milo up. Dimitri  Come on  Milo. You know what parents are like. They're always getting stressed. Milo  What do they want to come here for anyway  We don't know anyone. Dimitri  Well  you've got a new school to go to. You're going to meet loads of cool  new friends. Milo  I just really miss my old house  that's all. Dimitri  Well  this is a pretty awesome house  Milo. You've got a cool garden to play in and a pond. Milo  It was good skimming stones. This looks nice. You cleaned up my room. Thanks. PM  So after three quarters of an hour  he recognizes you. And I promise you  if you're sitting in front of this screen  that is a truly wonderful moment. And we're ready now to tell a story about his childhood and his life  and it goes on  and he has  you know  many adventures. Some of those adventures are a little bit dark or on the darker side. Some of those adventures are wonderfully encouraging    he's got to go to school. The cool thing is that we're doing as well  as you interact with him  you're able to put things into his world  he recognizes objects. His mind is based in a cloud. That means Milo's mind  as millions of people use it  will get smarter and cleverer. He'll recognize more objects and thus understand more words. But for me  this is a wonderful opportunity where technology  at last  can be connected with  where I am no longer restrained by the finger I hold in my hand    as far as a computer game's concerned    or by the blandness of not being noticed if you're watching a film or a book. And I love those revolutions  and I love the future that Milo brings. Thank you very much indeed. This talk is about righting writing wrongs. No  the sound's not faulty    righting writing wrongs. The Middle East is huge  and with all our problems  one thing's for sure  we love to laugh. I think humor is a great way to celebrate our differences. We need to take our responsibilities seriously  but not ourselves. Don't get me wrong  it's not like we don't have comedy in the Middle East. I grew up at a time when iconic actors from Kuwait  Syria  Egypt used laughter to unite the region  just as football can. Now is the time for us to laugh at ourselves  before others can laugh with us. This is the story of the rise and rise of stand up comedy in the Middle East    a stand up uprising  if you will. Working in London as TV maker and writer  I quickly realized that comedy connects audiences. Now  the best breeding ground for good comic writing is the stand up comedy circuit  where they just happen to say that you kill when you do well and you bomb when you do badly. An unfortunate connection for us maybe  but it reminds me that we'd like to thank one man for  over the past decade  working tirelessly to support comedians all around the world  specifically comedians with a Middle Eastern background. Like my good friends  Dean and Maysoon  at the bottom of the screen  who  two years after       started a festival to change the way Middle Easterners are perceived in the world. It's still going strong  with positive press to die for. Also  three guys working for years in Los Angeles  an Iranian  a Palestinian and an Egyptian  created the aptly named Axis of Evil comedy act. And wherever they went  they killed. Now  I didn't start this fire  but I did pour petrol on it. I moved to Dubai as the head of original content for a Western TV network. My job was to connect the brand with a Middle Eastern audience. Now  the American head of programming wanted new local Arabic comedy. In a thick Arabic accent  my brain went   Berfect.  Now  I had friends in the U.S. who had started a successful new tribe. And I had every intention of taking this tribe from being outliers in the Middle East and pushing them over the tipping point towards success. Now  as with any new idea  it wasn't easy. I had four phases to this plan. First  we'd need to buy content from the West and air it. Then I'd bring my friends  and we'd show local amateurs how it's done. We would film that and air it  and then I could work with the local amateurs and write new comedy. I excitedly presented this to the big boss  and his reaction was   Um  I don't get it.  So I retreated back to my cave and continued to support and produce comedy and let my friends use my couch as a regional operations hub. Now  fast forward two years  to early     . The earth rotated  as did our management  and as if by divine intervention  things came together to help this revolution take shape. Here's how the dots connected. First  the Axis guys recorded a Comedy Central special that aired in the States  and it was getting great hits on YouTube. Our new French CEO believed in the power of positive PR ... and ideas du bon marche. Let's just say  value for money.  I produced in Dubai a show for Ahmed Ahmed to showcase his new Axis special to a packed room. I invited our new CEO  and as soon as he realized we had a room packed full of laughing infidels  his reaction was very simple   Let's make this happen. And one more thing  No  don't F it up.  So I quickly went to work with a great team around me. I happened to find a funny guy to present it in Arabic  who is originally Korean  a perfect fit for the Axis of Evil. This is all true. Now  while preparing for the tour  I had to remind the guys to be culturally sensitive. I used the three Bs of stand up don'ts as I call them in the Middle East  blue content  keep it clean  beliefs  not religion  and the third B  bolitics. Stay away from bolitics in the Middle East. Oh course  you might think  what's left without bolitics  sex and religion  how can you make people laugh  I'd say  watch any successful well written  family friendly sitcom in the West for your answers. Now  were the Axis successful  In five countries  in just under a month  we had thousands of fanatical fans come and see them live. We had millions see them on TV and on TV news. In Jordan  we had His Majesty the King come and see them. In fact  they were so successful that you could buy a pirated copy of their DVD  even before it was released in the Middle East. Anywhere you go. So everywhere we went  we auditioned amateurs. We filmed that process and aired a documentary. I called it  Three Guys and Wonho.  It really is his name. And all this TV and Internet exposure has led to a great many recruits to our cause. In Dubai this year  we've just had the first all women's  homegrown stand up show. And notice two of them are wearing headscarves  and yes  even they can laugh. Dubai  to me  is like a hand that supports anyone who wants to make things happen.    years ago  no one had heard of it. Look at it now. With an inspirational leader  I think this year  the opening of the tallest tower in the world is like adding a finger to that hand  that points at all those who spread fallacious stories about us. Now  in three short years  we've come a long way with stand up comedy shows happening even in Saudi Arabia. These comics are now going to the New York festival. And the Lebanese  brilliant Lebanese  Nemr Abou Nassar  we featured in our first tour  has just been performing in L.A.'s legendary comedy clubs. So clearly  from the inside  we are doing our best to change our image  and it's exploding. So  as for the outsiders looking in  watch the CNN report on the second Amman Comedy Festival. The reporter did a great job  and I thank her  but somebody forgot to send the positive PR email to the person operating the automatic news ticker that appears at the bottom. For example  when Dean talks  the ticker says   U.S.  Suspect gave 'actionable intel.  Well  if you're used to listening to comedians  then I'm not surprised. Sadly  this leads me to another three Bs that represents how the media in the West talks about us as bombers  billionaires and belly dancers. Enough. We're not all angry fanatics who want to kill the infidel. We have a positive story to tell and image to sell. In fact  one thing's for sure  in my experience  we love to laugh like hell. Here are three questions that I like to use to test the truthiness of our representation in any media story. One  Is the Middle East being shown in a current time and correct context  Two  Do the Middle Eastern characters laugh or smile without showing the whites of their eyes  Three  Is the Middle Eastern character being played by one  Clearly  there are wrongs that need to be righted. We've started in our region. My challenge to the rest of the world is please  start using positive Middle Eastern images in your stories. For inspiration  go to one of our festivals  go online  drop us a line. Let's change the narrative together and let's start righting writing wrongs. I'd like to end  before going back to the Middle East  with a quote from one of the greatest Sheikhs to put quill to parchment. As my father likes to call him   Asheikh Azubare   as my mother would say   Shakespeare.   And now we go in content to liberty and not to banishment.  Thank you. I was one of the founding members of the Axis of Evil Comedy Tour. The other founding members included Ahmed Ahmed  who is an Egyptian American  who actually had the idea to go to the Middle East and try it out. Before we went out as a tour  he went out solo and did it first. Then there was Aron Kader  who was the Palestinian American. And then there was me  the Iranian American of the group. Now  being Iranian American presents its own set of problems  as you know. Those two countries aren't getting along these days. So it causes a lot of inner conflict  you know  like part of me likes me  part of me hates me. Part of me thinks I should have a nuclear program  the other part thinks I can't be trusted with one. These are dilemmas I have every day. But I was born in Iran  I'm now an American citizen  which means I have the American passport  which means I can travel. Because if you only have the Iranian passport  you're kind of limited to the countries you can go to with open arms  you know    Syria  Venezuela  North Korea. So anyone who's gotten their passport in America will tell you  when you get your passport  it still says what country you were born in. So I remember getting my American passport. I was like   Woohoo  I'm going to travel.  And I opened it up  it said   Born in Iran.  I'm like   Oh  come on  man.   I'm trying to go places.  But what's interesting is  I've never had trouble traveling in any other Western countries with my American passport  even though it says   Born in Iran.  No problems. Where I've had some problems is some of the Arab countries  because I guess some of the Arab countries aren't getting along with Iran either. And so I was in Kuwait recently  doing a comedy show with some other American comedians. They all went through  and then the border patrol saw my American passport.  Ah ha  American  great.  Then he opened it up.  Born in Iran  Wait.  And he started asking me questions. He said   What is your father's name   I said   Well  he's passed away  but his name was Khosro.  He goes   What is your grandfather's name   I said   He passed away a long time ago. His name was Jabbar.  He says   You wait. I'll be back   and he walked away. And I started freaking out  because I don't know what kind of crap my grandfather was into. Thought the guy was going to come back and be like   We've been looking for you for     years.   Your grandfather has a parking violation. It's way overdue. You owe us two billion dollars.  But as you can see  when I talk  I speak with an American accent  which you would think as an Iranian American actor  I should be able to play any part  good  bad  what have you. But a lot of times in Hollywood  when casting directors find out you're of Middle Eastern descent  they go   Oh  you're Iranian. Great. Can you say 'I will kill you in the name of Allah '   I could say that  but what if I were to say  'Hello. I'm your doctor '  They go   Great. And then you hijack the hospital.  Like I think you're missing the point here. Don't get me wrong  I don't mind playing bad guys. I want to play a bad guy. I want to rob a bank. I want to rob a bank in a film. I want to rob a bank in a film  but do it with a gun  with a gun  not with a bomb strapped around me  right. Because I imagine the director   Maz  I think your character would rob the bank with a bomb around him.   Why would I do that  If I want the money  why would I kill myself   Right.  Gimme all your money  or I'll blow myself up.   Well  then blow yourself up. Just do it outside  please.  But the fact is  there's good people everywhere. That's what I try and show in my stand up. There's good people everywhere. All it takes in one person to mess it up. Like a couple months ago in Times Square in New York  there was this Pakistani Muslim guy who tried to blow up a car bomb. Now  I happened to be in Times Square that night doing a comedy show. And a few months before that  there was a white American guy in Austin  Texas who flew his airplane into the IRS building  and I happened to be in Austin that day doing a stand up comedy show. Now I'll tell you  as a Middle Eastern male  when you show up around a lot of these activities  you start feeling guilty at one point. I was watching the news. I'm like   Am I involved in this crap    I didn't get the memo. What's going on   But what was interesting was  the Pakistani Muslim guy    see he gives a bad name to Muslims and Middle Easterners and Pakistanis from all over the world. And one thing that happened there was also the Pakistani Taliban took credit for that failed car bombing. My question is  why would you take credit for a failed car bombing   We just wanted to say we tried.   And furthermore  it is the thought that counts.   And in conclusion  win some  lose some.  But what happened was  when the white guy flew his plane into the building  I know all my Middle Eastern and Muslim friends in the States were watching TV  going   Please  don't be Middle Eastern. Don't be Hassan. Don't be Hussein.  And the name came out Jack. I'm like   Woooo  That's not one of us.  But I kept watching the news in case they came back  they were like   Before he did it  he converted to Islam.   Damn it  Why Jack  Why   But the fact is  I've been lucky to get a chance to perform all over the world  and I did a lot of shows in the Middle East. I just did a seven country solo tour. I was in Oman  and I was in Saudi Arabia. I was in Dubai. And it's great  there's good people everywhere. And you learn great things about these places. I encourage people always to go visit these places. For example  Dubai    cool place. They're obsessed with having the biggest  tallest  longest  as we all know. They have a mall there  the Dubai Mall. It is so big  they have taxis in the mall. I was walking. I heard  Beep  beep.  I'm like   What are you doing here   He goes   I'm going to the Zara store. It's three miles away. Out of my way. Out of my way. Out of my way.  And what's crazy    there's a recession going on  even in Dubai  but you wouldn't know by the prices. Like in the Dubai Mall  they sell frozen yogurt by the gram. It's like a drug deal. I was walking by. The guy goes   Psst. Habibi  my friend.   You want some frozen yogurt  Come here. Come here. Come here. I have one gram  five gram     gram. How many gram do you want   I bought five grams.    dollars.    dollars  I said   What's in this   He's like   Good stuff  man. Columbian. Top of the line. Top of the line.  The other thing you learn sometimes when you travel to these countries in the Middle East  sometimes in Latin American countries  South American countries    a lot of times when they build stuff  there's no rules and regulations. For example  I took my two year old son to the playground at the Dubai Mall. And I've taken my two year old son to playgrounds all over the United States. And when you put your two year old on a slide in the United States  they put something on the slide to slow the kid down as he comes down the slide. Not in the Middle East. I put my two year old on the slide  he went frrmrmm  He took off. I went down. I go   Where's my son    On the third floor  sir. On the third floor.   You take a taxi. You go to Zara. Make a left.   Try the yogurt. It's very good. Little expensive.  But one of the things I try to do with my stand up is to break stereotypes. And I've been guilty of stereotyping as well. I was in Dubai. And there's a lot of Indians who work in Dubai. And they don't get paid that well. And I got it in my head that all the Indians there must be workers. And I forgot there's obviously successful Indians in Dubai as well. I was doing a show  and they said   We're going to send a driver to pick you up.  So I went down to the lobby  and I saw this Indian guy. I go   He's got to be my driver.  Because he was standing there in like a cheap suit  thin mustache  staring at me. So I went over   Excuse me  sir  are you my driver   He goes   No  sir. I own the hotel.  I go   I'm sorry. Then why were you staring at me   He goes   I thought you were my driver.  I'll leave you guys with this  I try  with my stand up  to break stereotypes  present Middle Easterners in a positive light    Muslims in a positive light    and I hope that in the coming years  more film and television programs come out of Hollywood presenting us in a positive light. Who knows  maybe one day we'll even have our own James Bond  right.  My name is Bond  Jamal Bond.  Til then  I'll keep telling jokes. I hope you keep laughing. Have a good day. Thank you. My name's Seth Priebatsch. I'm the chief ninja of SCVNGR. I am a proud Princeton dropout. Also proud to have relocated here to Boston  where I actually grew up. Yeah  Boston. Easy wins. I should just go and name the counties that we've got around here. So  I'm also fairly determined to try and build a game layer on top of the world. And this is sort of a new concept  and it's really important. Because while the last decade was the decade of social and the decade of where the framework in which we connect with other people was built  this next decade will be the decade where the game framework is built  where the motivations that we use to actually influence behavior  and the framework in which that is constructed  is decided upon  and that's really important. And so I say that I want to build a game layer on top of the world  but that's not quite true because it's already under construction  it's already happening. And it looks like this right now. It looks like the Web did back in       right  It's not very good. It's cluttered. It's filled with lots of different things that  in short  aren't that fun. There are credit card schemes and airline mile programs and coupon cards and all these loyalty schemes that actually do use game dynamics and actually are building the game layer  they just suck. They're not very well designed  right  So  that's unfortunate. But luckily  as my favorite action hero  Bob the Builder  says   We can do better. We can build this better.  And the tools  the resources that we use to build a game layer are game dynamics themselves. And so  sort of  the crux of this presentation is going to go through four really important game dynamics  really interesting things  that  if you use consciously  you can use to influence behavior  both for good  for bad  for in between. Hopefully for good. But this is sort of the important stages in which that framework will get built  and so we want to all be thinking about it consciously now. Just before we jump into that  there's sort of a question of  why is this important  I'm sort of making this claim that there is a game layer on top of the world  and that it's very important that we build it properly. The reason that it's so important is that  the last decade  what we've seen has been building the social layer  has been this framework for connections  and construction on that layer is over  it's finished. There's still a lot to explore. There's still a lot of people who are trying to figure out social and how do we leverage this and how do we use this  but the framework itself is done  and it's called Facebook. And that's okay  right  A lot of people are very happy with Facebook. I like it quite a lot. They've created this thing called the Open Graph  and they own all of our connections. They own half a billion people. And so when you want to build on the social layer  the framework has been decided  it is the Open Graph API. And if you're happy with that  fantastic. If you're not  too bad. There's nothing you can do. But this next decade    and that's a real thing. I mean  we want to build frameworks in a way that makes it acceptable and makes it  you know  productive down the road. So  the social layer is all about these connections. The game layer is all about influence. It's not about adding a social fabric to the Web and connecting you to other people everywhere you are and everywhere you go. It's actually about using dynamics  using forces  to influence the behavior of where you are  what you do there  how you do it. That's really  really powerful  and it's going to be more important than the social layer. It's going to affect our lives more deeply and perhaps more invisibly. And so it's incredibly critical that at this moment  while it's just getting constructed  while the frameworks like Facebook  like the Open Graph  are being created for the game layer equivalent  that we think about it very consciously  and that we do it in a way that is open  that is available  and that can be leveraged for good. And so that's what I want to talk about for game dynamics  because construction has just begun  and the more consciously we can think about this  the better we'll be able to use it for anything that we want. So like I said  the way that you go through and build on the game layer is not with glass and steel and cement. And the resources that we use are not this two dimensional swath of land that we have. The resources are mindshare and the tools  the raw materials are these game dynamics. So with that  you know  a couple game dynamics to talk about. Four. Back at SCVNGR  we like to joke that with seven game dynamics  you can get anyone to do anything. And so today  I'm going to show you four  because I hope to have a competitive advantage at the end of this  still. So the first one  it's a very simple game dynamic. It's called the appointment dynamic. And this is a dynamic in which to succeed  players have to do something at a predefined time  generally at a predefined place. And these dynamics are a little scary sometimes  because you think  you know  other people can be using forces that will manipulate how I interact  what I do  where I do it  when I do it. This sort of loss of free will that occurs in games can be frightening  so with each dynamic  I'm going to give three examples  one that shows how this is already being used in the real world  so you can sort of rationalize it a little bit  one that shows it in what we consider a conventional game    I think everything is a game  but this is sort of more of a what you would think is a game played on a board or on a computer screen  and then one how this can be used for good  so we can see that these forces can really be very powerful. So the first one    the most famous appointment dynamic in the world    is something called happy hour. So I just recently dropped out of Princeton and actually ended up for the first time in a bar  and I saw these happy hour things all over the place  right. And this is simply an appointment dynamic. Come here at a certain time  get your drinks half off. To win  all you have to do is show up at the right place at the right time. This game dynamic is so powerful that it doesn't just influence our behavior  it's influenced our entire culture. That's a really scary thought  that one game dynamic can change things so powerfully. It also exists in more conventional game forms. I'm sure you've all heard of Farmville by now. If you haven't  I recommend playing it. You won't do anything else with the rest of your day. Farmville has more active users than Twitter. It's incredibly powerful  and it has this dynamic where you have to return at a certain time to water your crops    fake crops    or they wilt. And this is so powerful that  when they tweak their stats  when they say your crops wilt after eight hours  or after six hours  or after    hours  it changes the lifecycle of    million some people during the day. They will return like clockwork at different times. So if they wanted the world to end  if they wanted productivity to stop  they could make this a    minute cycle  and no one could do anything else  right  That's a little scary. But this could also be used for good. This is a local company called Vitality  and they've created a product to help people take their medicine on time. That's an appointment. It's something that people don't do very well. And they have these GlowCaps  which  you know  flash and email you and do all sorts of cool things to remind you to take your medicine. This is one that isn't a game yet  but really should be. You should get points for doing this on time. You should lose points for not doing this on time. They should consciously recognize that they've built an appointment dynamic and leverage the games. And then you can really achieve good in some interesting ways. We're going to jump onto the next one  maybe. Yes. Influence and status. So this is one of the most famous game dynamics. It's used all over the place. It's used in your wallets  right now. We all want that credit card on the far left because it's black. And you see someone at CVS or    not CVS    at Christian Dior or something  and then ... I don't know. I don't have a black card  I've got a debit card. So they whip it out. And you see men  they have that black card. I want that because that means that they're cooler than I am  and I need that. And this is used in games as well.  Modern Warfare   one of the most successful selling games of all time. I'm only a level four  but I desperately want to be a level     because they've got that cool red badge thing  and that means that I am somehow better than everyone else. And that's very powerful to me. Status is really good motivator. It's also used in more conventional settings and can be used more consciously in conventional settings. School    and remember  I made it through one year  so I think I'm qualified to talk on school    is a game  it's just not a terribly well designed game  right. There are levels. There are C. There are B. There is A. There are statuses. I mean  what is valedictorian  but a status  If we called valedictorian a  white knight paladin level      I think people would probably work a lot harder. So school is a game  and there have been lots of experimentations on how we do this properly. But let's use it consciously. Like why have games that you can lose  Why go from an A to an F or a B to a C  That sucks. Why not level up  And at Princeton  they've actually experimented with this  where they have quizzes where you gain experience points  and you level up from B to an A. And it's very powerful. It can be used in interesting ways. The third one I want to talk about quickly is the progression dynamic  where you have to sort of make progress  you have to move through different steps in a very granular fashion. This is used all over the place  including LinkedIn  where I am an un whole individual. I am only    percent complete on LinkedIn  and that bothers me. And this is so deep seated in our psyche that when we're presented with a progress bar and presented with easy  granular steps to take to try and complete that progress bar  we will do it. We will find a way to move that blue line all the way to the right edge of the screen. This is used in conventional games as well. I mean  you see this is a paladin level     and that's a paladin level     and if you were going to fight  you know  orcs on the fields of Mordor against the Raz al Ghul  you'd probably want to be the bigger one  right. I would. And so people work very hard to level up.  World of Warcraft  is one of the most successful games of all time. The average player spends something like six  six and a half hours a day on it. Their most dedicated players  it's like a full time job. It's insane. And they have these systems where you can level up. And that's a very powerful thing. Progression is powerful. It can also be used in very compelling ways for good. One of the things that we work on at SCVNGR is how do you use games to drive traffic and drive business to local businesses  to sort of something that is very key to the economy. And here we have a game that people play. They go places  they do challenges  they earn points. And we've introduced a progression dynamic into it  where  by going to the same place over and over  by doing challenges  by engaging with the business  you move a green bar from the left edge of the screen to the right edge of the screen  and you eventually unlock rewards. And this is powerful enough that we can see that it hooks people into these dynamics  pulls them back to the same local businesses  creates huge loyalty  creates engagement  and is able to drive meaningful revenue and fun and engagement to businesses. These progression dynamics are powerful and can be used in the real world. The final one I want to talk about    and it's a great one to end on    is this concept of communal discovery  a dynamic in which everyone has to work together to achieve something. And communal discovery is powerful because it leverages the network that is society to solve problems. This is used in some sort of famous consumer web stories  like Digg  which I'm sure you've all heard of. Digg is a communal dynamic to try to find and source the best news  the most interesting stories. And they made this into a game  initially. They had a leader board  where  if you recommended the best stories  you would get points. And that really motivated people to find the best stories. But it became so powerful that there was actually a cabal  a group of people  the top seven on the leader board  who would work together to make sure they maintained that position. And they would recommend other people's stories  and the game became more powerful than the goal. And they actually had to end up shutting down the leader board because while it was effective  it was so powerful that it stopped sourcing the best stories and started having people work to maintain their leadership. So we have to use this one carefully. It's also used in things like McDonald's Monopoly  where the game is not the Monopoly game you're playing  but the sort of cottage industries that form to try and find Boardwalk  right. And now they're just looking for a little sticker that says  Boardwalk.  But it can also be used to find real things. This is the DARPA balloon challenge  where they hid a couple balloons all across the United States and said   Use networks. Try and find these balloons fastest  and the winner will get        .  And the winner was actually a group out of MIT  where they created sort of a pyramid scheme  a network  where the first person to recommend the location of a balloon got        and anyone else to push that recommendation up also got a cut of it. And in    hours  they were able to find all these balloons  all across the country  right. Really powerful dynamic. And so  I've got about    seconds left  so if I'm going to leave you with anything  last decade was the decade of social. This next decade is the decade of games. We use game dynamics to build on it. We build with mindshare. We can influence behavior. It is very powerful. It is very exciting. Let's all build it together  let's do it well and have fun playing. It feels like we're all suffering from information overload or data glut. And the good news is there might be an easy solution to that  and that's using our eyes more. So  visualizing information  so that we can see the patterns and connections that matter and then designing that information so it makes more sense  or it tells a story  or allows us to focus only on the information that's important. Failing that  visualized information can just look really cool. So  let's see. This is the  Billion Dollar o Gram  and this image arose out of frustration I had with the reporting of billion dollar amounts in the press. That is  they're meaningless without context      billion for this pipeline     billion for this war. It doesn't make any sense  so the only way to understand it is visually and relatively. So I scraped a load of reported figures from various news outlets and then scaled the boxes according to those amounts. And the colors here represent the motivation behind the money. So purple is  fighting   and red is  giving money away   and green is  profiteering.  And what you can see straight away is you start to have a different relationship to the numbers. You can literally see them. But more importantly  you start to see patterns and connections between numbers that would otherwise be scattered across multiple news reports. Let me point out some that I really like. This is OPEC's revenue  this green box here        billion a year. And this little pixel in the corner    three billion    that's their climate change fund. Americans  incredibly generous people    over     billion a year  donated to charity every year  compared with the amount of foreign aid given by the top    industrialized nations at     billion. Then of course  the Iraq War  predicted to cost just    billion back in     . And it mushroomed slightly. Afghanistan and Iraq mushroomed now to       billion. So now it's great because now we have this texture  and we can add numbers to it as well. So we could say  well  a new figure comes out ... let's see African debt. How much of this diagram do you think might be taken up by the debt that Africa owes to the West  Let's take a look. So there it is      billion is what Africa owes. And the recent financial crisis  how much of this diagram might that figure take up  What has that cost the world  Let's take a look at that. Dooosh    Which I think is the appropriate sound effect for that much money         billion. So  by visualizing this information  we turned it into a landscape that you can explore with your eyes  a kind of map really  a sort of information map. And when you're lost in information  an information map is kind of useful. So I want to show you another landscape now. We need to imagine what a landscape of the world's fears might look like. Let's take a look. This is Mountains Out of Molehills  a timeline of global media panic. So  I'll label this for you in a second. But the height here  I want to point out  is the intensity of certain fears as reported in the media. Let me point them out. So this  swine flu    pink. Bird flu. SARS    brownish here. Remember that one  The millennium bug  terrible disaster. These little green peaks are asteroid collisions. And in summer  here  killer wasps. So these are what our fears look like over time in our media. But what I love    and I'm a journalist    and what I love is finding hidden patterns  I love being a data detective. And there's a very interesting and odd pattern hidden in this data that you can only see when you visualize it. Let me highlight it for you. See this line  this is a landscape for violent video games. As you can see  there's a kind of odd  regular pattern in the data  twin peaks every year. If we look closer  we see those peaks occur at the same month every year. Why  Well  November  Christmas video games come out  and there may well be an upsurge in the concern about their content. But April isn't a particularly massive month for video games. Why April  Well  in April      was the Columbine shooting  and since then  that fear has been remembered by the media and echoes through the group mind gradually through the year. You have retrospectives  anniversaries  court cases  even copy cat shootings  all pushing that fear into the agenda. And there's another pattern here as well. Can you spot it  See that gap there  There's a gap  and it affects all the other stories. Why is there a gap there  You see where it starts  September       when we had something very real to be scared about. So  I've been working as a data journalist for about a year  and I keep hearing a phrase all the time  which is this   Data is the new oil.  Data is the kind of ubiquitous resource that we can shape to provide new innovations and new insights  and it's all around us  and it can be mined very easily. It's not a particularly great metaphor in these times  especially if you live around the Gulf of Mexico  but I would  perhaps  adapt this metaphor slightly  and I would say that data is the new soil. Because for me  it feels like a fertile  creative medium. Over the years  online  we've laid down a huge amount of information and data  and we irrigate it with networks and connectivity  and it's been worked and tilled by unpaid workers and governments. And  all right  I'm kind of milking the metaphor a little bit. But it's a really fertile medium  and it feels like visualizations  infographics  data visualizations  they feel like flowers blooming from this medium. But if you look at it directly  it's just a lot of numbers and disconnected facts. But if you start working with it and playing with it in a certain way  interesting things can appear and different patterns can be revealed. Let me show you this. Can you guess what this data set is  What rises twice a year  once in Easter and then two weeks before Christmas  has a mini peak every Monday  and then flattens out over the summer  I'll take answers. You might want to get some chocolate in. Any other guesses  Yeah  retail therapy might help. DM  Sick leave. Yeah  you'll definitely want to take some time off. Shall we see  So  the information guru Lee Byron and myself  we scraped        status Facebook updates for the phrase  break up  and  broken up  and this is the pattern we found    people clearing out for Spring Break  coming out of very bad weekends on a Monday  being single over the summer  and then the lowest day of the year  of course  Christmas Day. Who would do that  So there's a titanic amount of data out there now  unprecedented. But if you ask the right kind of question  or you work it in the right kind of way  interesting things can emerge. So information is beautiful. Data is beautiful. I wonder if I could make my life beautiful. And here's my visual C.V. I'm not quite sure I've succeeded. Pretty blocky  the colors aren't that great. But I wanted to convey something to you. I started as a programmer  and then I worked as a writer for many years  about    years  in print  online and then in advertising  and only recently have I started designing. And I've never been to design school. I've never studied art or anything. I just kind of learned through doing. And when I started designing  I discovered an odd thing about myself. I already knew how to design  but it wasn't like I was amazingly brilliant at it  but more like I was sensitive to the ideas of grids and space and alignment and typography. It's almost like being exposed to all this media over the years had instilled a kind of dormant design literacy in me. And I don't feel like I'm unique. I feel that everyday  all of us now are being blasted by information design. It's being poured into our eyes through the Web  and we're all visualizers now  we're all demanding a visual aspect to our information. There's something almost quite magical about visual information. It's effortless  it literally pours in. And if you're navigating a dense information jungle  coming across a beautiful graphic or a lovely data visualization  it's a relief  it's like coming across a clearing in the jungle. I was curious about this  so it led me to the work of a Danish physicist called Tor Norretranders  and he converted the bandwidth of the senses into computer terms. So here we go. This is your senses  pouring into your senses every second. Your sense of sight is the fastest. It has the same bandwidth as a computer network. Then you have touch  which is about the speed of a USB key. And then you have hearing and smell  which has the throughput of a hard disk. And then you have poor old taste  which is like barely the throughput of a pocket calculator. And that little square in the corner  a naught .  percent  that's the amount we're actually aware of. So a lot of your vision    the bulk of it is visual  and it's pouring in. It's unconscious. The eye is exquisitely sensitive to patterns in variations in color  shape and pattern. It loves them  and it calls them beautiful. It's the language of the eye. If you combine the language of the eye with the language of the mind  which is about words and numbers and concepts  you start speaking two languages simultaneously  each enhancing the other. So  you have the eye  and then you drop in the concepts. And that whole thing    it's two languages both working at the same time. So we can use this new kind of language  if you like  to alter our perspective or change our views. Let me ask you a simple question with a really simple answer  Who has the biggest military budget  It's got to be America  right  Massive.     billion in              rather. So massive  in fact  that it can contain all the other military budgets in the world inside itself. Gobble  gobble  gobble  gobble  gobble. Now  you can see Africa's total debt there and the U.K. budget deficit for reference. So that might well chime with your view that America is a sort of warmongering military machine  out to overpower the world with its huge industrial military complex. But is it true that America has the biggest military budget  Because America is an incredibly rich country. In fact  it's so massively rich that it can contain the four other top industrialized nations' economies inside itself  it's so vastly rich. So its military budget is bound to be enormous. So  to be fair and to alter our perspective  we have to bring in another data set  and that data set is GDP  or the country's earnings. Who has the biggest budget as a proportion of GDP  Let's have a look. That changes the picture considerably. Other countries pop into view that you  perhaps  weren't considering  and American drops into eighth. Now you can also do this with soldiers. Who has the most soldiers  It's got to be China. Of course   .  million. Again  chiming with your view that China has a militarized regime ready to  you know  mobilize its enormous forces. But of course  China has an enormous population. So if we do the same  we see a radically different picture. China drops to    th. It actually has a tiny army when you take other data into consideration. So  absolute figures  like the military budget  in a connected world  don't give you the whole picture. They're not as true as they could be. We need relative figures that are connected to other data so that we can see a fuller picture  and then that can lead to us changing our perspective. As Hans Rosling  the master  my master  said   Let the dataset change your mindset.  And if it can do that  maybe it can also change your behavior. Take a look at this one. I'm a bit of a health nut. I love taking supplements and being fit  but I can never understand what's going on in terms of evidence. There's always conflicting evidence. Should I take vitamin C  Should I be taking wheatgrass  This is a visualization of all the evidence for nutritional supplements. This kind of diagram is called a balloon race. So the higher up the image  the more evidence there is for each supplement. And the bubbles correspond to popularity as regards to Google hits. So you can immediately apprehend the relationship between efficacy and popularity  but you can also  if you grade the evidence  do a  worth it  line. So supplements above this line are worth investigating  but only for the conditions listed below  and then the supplements below the line are perhaps not worth investigating. Now this image constitutes a huge amount of work. We scraped like       studies from PubMed  the biomedical database  and we compiled them and graded them all. And it was incredibly frustrating for me because I had a book of     visualizations to do for my book  and I spent a month doing this  and I only filled two pages. But what it points to is that visualizing information like this is a form of knowledge compression. It's a way of squeezing an enormous amount of information and understanding into a small space. And once you've curated that data  and once you've cleaned that data  and once it's there  you can do cool stuff like this. So I converted this into an interactive app  so I can now generate this application online    this is the visualization online    and I can say   Yeah  brilliant.  So it spawns itself. And then I can say   Well  just show me the stuff that affects heart health.  So let's filter that out. So heart is filtered out  so I can see if I'm curious about that. I think   No  no. I don't want to take any synthetics  I just want to see plants and    just show me herbs and plants. I've got all the natural ingredients.  Now this app is spawning itself from the data. The data is all stored in a Google Doc  and it's literally generating itself from that data. So the data is now alive  this is a living image  and I can update it in a second. New evidence comes out. I just change a row on a spreadsheet. Doosh  Again  the image recreates itself. So it's cool. It's kind of living. But it can go beyond data  and it can go beyond numbers. I like to apply information visualization to ideas and concepts. This is a visualization of the political spectrum  an attempt for me to try and understand how it works and how the ideas percolate down from government into society and culture  into families  into individuals  into their beliefs and back around again in a cycle. What I love about this image is it's made up of concepts  it explores our worldviews and it helps us    it helps me anyway    to see what others think  to see where they're coming from. And it feels just incredibly cool to do that. What was most exciting for me designing this was that  when I was designing this image  I desperately wanted this side  the left side  to be better than the right side    being a journalist  a Left leaning person    but I couldn't  because I would have created a lopsided  biased diagram. So  in order to really create a full image  I had to honor the perspectives on the right hand side and at the same time  uncomfortably recognize how many of those qualities were actually in me  which was very  very annoying and uncomfortable. But not too uncomfortable  because there's something unthreatening about seeing a political perspective  versus being told or forced to listen to one. You're capable of holding conflicting viewpoints joyously when you can see them. It's even fun to engage with them because it's visual. So that's what's exciting to me  seeing how data can change my perspective and change my mind midstream    beautiful  lovely data. So  just to wrap up  I wanted to say that it feels to me that design is about solving problems and providing elegant solutions  and information design is about solving information problems. It feels like we have a lot of information problems in our society at the moment  from the overload and the saturation to the breakdown of trust and reliability and runaway skepticism and lack of transparency  or even just interestingness. I mean  I find information just too interesting. It has a magnetic quality that draws me in. So  visualizing information can give us a very quick solution to those kinds of problems. Even when the information is terrible  the visual can be quite beautiful. Often we can get clarity or the answer to a simple question very quickly  like this one  the recent Icelandic volcano. Which was emitting the most CO   Was it the planes or the volcano  the grounded planes or the volcano  So we can have a look. We look at the data and we see  Yep  the volcano emitted         tons  the grounded planes would have emitted         if they were in the sky. So essentially  we had our first carbon neutral volcano. And that is beautiful. Thank you. Come with me to the bottom of the world  Antarctica  the highest  driest  windiest  and yes  coldest region on Earth    more arid than the Sahara and  in parts  colder than Mars. The ice of Antarctica glows with a light so dazzling  it blinds the unprotected eye. Early explorers rubbed cocaine in their eyes to kill the pain of it. The weight of the ice is such that the entire continent sags below sea level  beneath its weight. Yet  the ice of Antarctica is a calendar of climate change. It records the annual rise and fall of greenhouse gases and temperatures going back before the onset of the last ice ages. Nowhere on Earth offers us such a perfect record. And here  scientists are drilling into the past of our planet to find clues to the future of climate change. This past January  I traveled to a place called WAIS Divide  about     miles from the South Pole. It is the best place on the planet  many say  to study the history of climate change. There  about    scientists from the University of Wisconsin  the Desert Research Institute in Nevada and others have been working to answer a central question about global warming. What is the exact relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and planetary temperatures  It's urgent work. We know that temperatures are rising. This past May was the warmest worldwide on record. And we know that levels of greenhouse gases are rising too. What we don't know is the exact  precise  immediate impact of these changes on natural climate patterns    winds  ocean currents  precipitation rates  cloud formation  things that bear on the health and well being of billions of people. Their entire camp  every item of gear  was ferried     miles from McMurdo Station  the main U.S. supply base on the coast of Antarctica. WAIS Divide itself though  is a circle of tents in the snow. In blizzard winds  the crew sling ropes between the tents so that people can feel their way safely to the nearest ice house and to the nearest outhouse. It snows so heavily there  the installation was almost immediately buried. Indeed  the researchers picked this site because ice and snow accumulates here    times faster than anywhere else in Antarctica. They have to dig themselves out every day. It makes for an exotic and chilly commute. But under the surface is a hive of industrial activity centered around an eight million dollar drill assembly. Periodically  this drill  like a biopsy needle  plunges thousands of feet deep into the ice to extract a marrow of gases and isotopes for analysis. Ten times a day  they extract the    foot long cylinder of compressed ice crystals that contain the unsullied air and trace chemicals laid down by snow  season after season for thousands of years. It's really a time machine. At the peak of activity earlier this year  the researchers lowered the drill an extra hundred feet deeper into the ice every day and another     years deeper into the past. Periodically  they remove a cylinder of ice  like gamekeepers popping a spent shotgun shell from the barrel of a drill. They inspect it  they check it for cracks  for drill damage  for spalls  for chips. More importantly  they prepare it for inspection and analysis by    independent laboratories in the United States and Europe  who will examine it for    different trace chemicals related to climate  some in parts per quadrillion. Yes  I said that with a Q  quadrillion. They cut the cylinders up into three foot sections for easier handling and shipment back to these labs  some       miles from the drill site. Each cylinder is a parfait of time. This ice formed as snow        years ago  when our ancestors were daubing themselves with paint and considering the radical new technology of the alphabet. Bathed in polarized light and cut in cross section  this ancient ice reveals itself as a mosaic of colors  each one showing how conditions at depth in the ice have affected this material at depths where pressures can reach a ton per square inch. Every year  it begins with a snowflake  and by digging into fresh snow  we can see how this process is ongoing today. This wall of undisturbed snow  back lit by sunlight  shows the striations of winter and summer snow  layer upon layer. Each storm scours the atmosphere  washing out dust  soot  trace chemicals  and depositing them on the snow pack year after year  millennia after millennia  creating a kind of periodic table of elements that at this point is more than        feet thick. From this  we can detect an extraordinary number of things. We can see the calcium from the world's deserts  soot from distant wildfires  methane as an indicator of the strength of a Pacific monsoon  all wafted on winds from warmer latitudes to this remote and very cold place. Most importantly  these cylinders and this snow trap air. Each cylinder is about    percent ancient air  a pristine time capsule of greenhouse gases    carbon dioxide  methane  nitrous oxide    all unchanged from the day that snow formed and first fell. And this is the object of their scrutiny. But don't we already know what we need to know about greenhouse gases  Why do we need to study this anymore  Don't we already know how they affect temperatures  Don't we already know the consequences of a changing climate on our settled civilization  The truth is  we only know the outlines  and what we don't completely understand  we can't properly fix. Indeed  we run the risk of making things worse. Consider  the single most successful international environmental effort of the   th century  the Montreal Protocol  in which the nations of Earth banded together to protect the planet from the harmful effects of ozone destroying chemicals used at that time in air conditioners  refrigerators and other cooling devices. We banned those chemicals  and we replaced them  unknowingly  with other substances that  molecule per molecule  are a hundred times more potent as heat trapping  greenhouse gases than carbon dioxide. This process requires extraordinary precautions. The scientists must insure that the ice is not contaminated. Moreover  in this       mile journey  they have to insure this ice doesn't melt. Imagine juggling a snowball across the tropics. They have to  in fact  make sure this ice never gets warmer than about    degrees below zero  otherwise  the key gases inside it will dissipate. So  in the coldest place on Earth  they work inside a refrigerator. As they handle the ice  in fact  they keep an extra pair of gloves warming in an oven  so that  when their work gloves freeze and their fingers stiffen  they can don a fresh pair. They work against the clock and against the thermometer. So far  they've packed up about       feet of ice cores for shipment back to the United States. This past season  they manhandled them across the ice to waiting aircraft. The    th Air National Guard flew the most recent shipment of ice back to the coast of Antarctica  where it was boarded onto a freighter  shipped across the tropics to California  unloaded  put on a truck  driven across the desert to the National Ice Core Laboratory in Denver  Colorado  where  as we speak  scientists are now slicing this material up for samples  for analysis  to be distributed to the laboratories around the country and in Europe. Antarctica was this planet's last empty quarter    the blind spot in our expanding vision of the world. Early explorers sailed off the edge of the map  and they found a place where the normal rules of time and temperature seem suspended. Here  the ice seems a living presence. The wind that rubs against it gives it voice. It is a voice of experience. It is a voice we should heed. Thank you. Cartoons are basically short stories. I tried to find one that didn't have a whole lot of words. Not all of them have happy endings. So how did I get started cartooning  I doodled a lot as a kid  and if you spend enough time doodling  sooner or later  something happens  all your career options run out. So you have to make a living cartooning. Actually  I fell in love with the ocean when I was a little boy  when I was about eight or nine. And I was particularly fascinated with sharks. This is some of my early work. Eventually  my mom took the red crayon away  so it was  unclear . But I'd like to relay to you a childhood experience of mine that really made me see the ocean differently  and it's become the foundation of my work because  I feel like  if in a day  I can see the ocean differently  then I can evoke that same kind of change in others  especially kids. Before that day  this is how I saw the ocean. It's just a big blue surface. And this is how we've seen the ocean since the beginning of time. It's a mystery. There's been a lot of folklore developed around the ocean  mostly negative. And that prompted people to make maps like this  with all kinds of wonderful detail on the land  but when you get to the waters edge  the ocean looks like one giant puddle of blue paint. And this is the way I saw the ocean at school    as if to say   All geography and science lessons stop at water's edge. This part's not going to be on the test.  But that day I flew low over the islands    it was a family trip to the Caribbean  and I flew in a small plane low over the islands. This is what I saw. I saw hills and valleys. I saw forests and meadows. I saw grottoes and secret gardens and places I'd love to hide as a kid  if I could only breathe underwater. And best of all  I saw the animals. I saw a manta ray that looked as big as the plane I was flying in. And I flew over a lagoon with a shark in it  and that was the day that my comic strip about a shark was born. So from that day on  I was an ordinary kid walking around on dry land  but my head was down there  underwater. Up until that day  these were the animals that were most common in my life. These were the ones I'd like to draw    all variations of four legs and fur. But when you got to the ocean  my imagination was no competition for nature. Every time I'd come up with a crazy cartoon character on the drawing board  I'd find a critter in the ocean that was even crazier. And the differences in scale between this tiny sea dragon and this enormous humpback whale was like something out of a science fiction movie. Whenever I talk to kids  I always like to tell them  the biggest animal that ever lived is still alive. It's not a dinosaur  it's a whale  animals as big as office buildings still swimming around out there in our ocean. Speaking of dinosaurs  sharks are basically the same fish they were     million years ago. So if you ever fantasize about going back in time and seeing what a dinosaur looked like  that's what a dinosaur looks like. So you have living dinosaurs and space aliens  animals that evolved in zero gravity in harsh conditions. It's just incredible  no Hollywood designer could come up with something more interesting than that. Or this fangtooth. The particles in the water make it look like it's floating in outer space. Could you image if we looked through the Hubble Telescope and we saw that  It would start a whole new space race. But instead  we stick a camera in the deep ocean  and we see a fish  and it doesn't capture our imagination as a society. We say to ourselves   Maybe we can make fish sticks with it or something.  So  what I'd like to do now is try a little drawing. So  I'm going to try to draw this fangtooth here. I love to draw the deep sea fish  because they are so ugly  but beautiful in their own way. Maybe we can give him a little bioluminescence here    give him a headlight  maybe a brake light  turn signals. But it's easy to see why these animals make such great cartoon characters  their shapes and sizes. So some of them actually seem to have powers like superheroes in a comic book. For instance  take these sea turtles. They kind of have a sixth sense like Superman's x ray vision. They can sense the magnetic fields of the earth. And they can use that sense to navigate hundreds of miles of open ocean. I kind of give my turtle hands just to make them an easier cartoon character to work with. Or take this sea cucumber. It's not an animal we draw cartoons of or draw at all. He's like an underwater Spiderman. He shoots out these sticky webs to entangle his enemy. Of course  sea cucumbers shoot them out their rears  which  in my opinion  makes them much more interesting a superhero. He can't spin a web anytime  he's got to pull his pants down first. Or the blowfish. The blowfish is like the Incredible Hulk. It can change its body into a big  intimidating fish in a matter of seconds. I'm going to draw this blowfish uninflated. And then I'm going to attempt onscreen animation here. Let's see. Try and inflate it.  You talkin' to me   See  he can inflate himself when he wants to be intimidating. Or take this swordfish. Could you imagine being born with a tool for a nose  Do you think he wakes up in the morning  looks in the mirror and says   Somebody's getting stabbed today.  Or this lionfish for instance. Imagine trying to make friends covered with razor sharp poisonous barbs. It's not something you want to put on your Facebook page  right  My characters are    my lead character's a shark named Sherman. He's a great white shark. And I kind of broke the mold with Sherman. I didn't want to go with this ruthless predator image. He's kind of just out there making a living. He's sort of a Homer Simpson with fins. And then his sidekick is a sea turtle  as I mentioned before  named Filmore. He uses his wonderful skills at navigation to wander the oceans  looking for a mate. And he does manage to find them  but great navigation skills  lousy pick up lines. He never seems to settle on any particular girl. I have a hermit crab named Hawthorne  who doesn't get a lot of respect as a hermit crab  so he kind of wishes he were a great white shark. And then I'll introduce you to one more character  this guy  Ernest  who is basically a juvenile delinquent in a fish body. So with characters  you can make stories. Sometimes making a story is as easy as putting two characters in a room and seeing what happens. So  imagine a great white shark and a giant squid in the same bathroom. Or  sometimes I take them to places that people have never heard of because they're underwater. For instance  I took them skiing in the Mid Atlantic Range  which is this range of mountains in the middle of the Atlantic. I've taken them to the Sea of Japan  where they met giant jellyfish. I've taken them camping in the kelp forests of California. This next one here  I did a story on the census of marine life. And that was a lot of fun because  as most of you know  it's a real project we've heard about. But it was a chance for me to introduce readers to a lot of crazy undersea characters. So we start off the story with Ernest  who volunteers as a census taker. He goes down and he meets this famous anglerfish. Then he meets the yeti crab  the famous vampire squid    elusive  hard to find    and the Dumbo octopus  which looks so much like a cartoon in real life that really didn't have to change a thing when I drew it. I did another story on marine debris. I was speaking to a lot of my friends in the conservation business  and they    I asked them   So what's one issue you would like everyone to know more about   And they said    this one friend of mine said   I've got one word for you  plastic.  And I told him   Well  I need something a little sexier than that. Plastic just is not going to do it.  We sort of worked things out. He wanted me to use words like polyvinyl chloride  which doesn't really work in voice balloons very well. I couldn't fit them in. So what I did was I made an adventure strip. Basically  this bottle travels a long way. What I'm trying to tell readers is that plastic doesn't really go away  it just continues to wash downstream. And a lot of it ends up washing into the ocean  which is a great story if you attach a couple characters to it  especially if they can't stand each other  like these two. So  I sent them to Boise  Idaho  where they dropped a plastic bottle into the Boise sewer system. And it ended up in the Boise River and then on to the Columbia River and then to the mouth of the Columbia and to the Pacific Ocean and then on to this place called the Great Pacific Garbage Patch    which is this giant Pacific gyre in the North Pacific  where a lot of this plastic ends up floating around    and then back onto the lagoon. So that was basically a buddy story with a plastic bottle following along. So a lot of people remember the plastic bottle anyway  but we really talked about marine debris and plastic in the course of that one. The third storyline I did about a year and a half ago was probably my most difficult. It was on shark finning  and I felt really strongly about this issue. And I felt like  since my main character was a shark  the comic strip was a perfect vehicle for telling the public about this. Now  finning is the act of taking a shark  cutting the valuable fins off and throwing the live animal back in the water. It's cruel  it's wasteful. There's nothing funny or entertaining about it  but I really wanted to take this issue on. I had to kill my main character  who is a shark. We start with Sherman in a Chinese restaurant  who gets a fortune that he's about to get caught by a trawler  which he does. And then he dies. He gets finned  and then he gets thrown overboard. Ostensibly  he's dead now. And so I killed a character that's been in the newspaper for    years. So I got a lot of reader feedback on that one. Meanwhile  the other characters are talking about shark fin soup. I do three or four strips after that where we explore the finning issue and the shark fin soup issue. Sherman's up in shark heaven. This is what I love about comic strips  you know. You really don't have to worry about the audience suspending its sense of disbelief because  if you start with a talking shark  readers pretty much check their disbelief at the door. You can kind of do anything. It becomes a near death experience for Sherman. Meanwhile  Ernest finds his fins on the internet. There was a real website based in China that actually sold shark fins  so I kind of exposed that. And he clicks the  buy now  button. And voila  next day air  they show up  and they surgically reattach them. I ended that series with a kind of a mail in petition that encouraged our National Marine Fishery Service  to force other countries to have a stronger stance with shark management. Thanks. I'd like to end with a little metaphor here. I've been trying to think of a metaphor to represent Mission Blue  and this is what I came up with. Imagine you're in an enormous room  and it's as dark as a cave. And you can have anything in that room  anything you want  but you can't see anything. You've been given one tool  a hammer. So you wander around in the darkness  and you bump into something  and it feels like it's made of stone. It's big  it's heavy. You can't carry it away  so you bang it with your hammer  and you break off a piece. And you take the piece out into the daylight. And you see you have a beautiful piece of white alabaster. So you say to yourself   Well  that's worth something.  So you go back into the room  and you break this thing to pieces  and you haul it away. And you find other things  and you break that up  and you haul those away. And you're getting all kinds of cool stuff. And you hear other people doing the same thing. So you get this sense of urgency  like you need to find as much stuff as possible as soon as possible. And then some yells   Stop   And they turn up the lights. And you realize where you are  you're in the Louvre. And you've taken all this complexity and beauty  and you've turned it into a cheap commodity. And that's what we're doing with the ocean. And part of what Mission Blue is about is yelling   Stop   so that each of us    explorer  scientist  cartoonist  singer  chef    can turn up the lights in their own way. And that's what I hope my comic strip does in a small way. That's why I like what I do. Thanks for listening. So I'm going to talk to you about you about the political chemistry of oil spills and why this is an incredibly important  long  oily  hot summer  and why we need to keep ourselves from getting distracted. But before I talk about the political chemistry  I actually need to talk about the chemistry of oil. This is a photograph from when I visited Prudhoe Bay in Alaska in      to watch the Minerals Management Service testing their ability to burn oil spills in ice. And what you see here is  you see a little bit of crude oil  you see some ice cubes  and you see two sandwich baggies of napalm. The napalm is burning there quite nicely. And the thing is  is that oil is really an abstraction for us as the American consumer. We're four percent of the world's population  we use    percent of the world's oil production. And we don't really understand what oil is  until you check out its molecules  And you don't really understand that until you see this stuff burn. So this is what happens as that burn gets going. It takes off. It's a big woosh. I highly recommend that you get a chance to see crude oil burn someday  because you will never need to hear another poli sci lecture on the geopolitics of oil again. It'll just bake your retinas. So there it is  the retinas are baking. Let me tell you a little bit about this chemistry of oil. Oil is a stew of hydrocarbon molecules. It starts of with the very small ones  which are one carbon  four hydrogen    that's methane    it just floats off. Then there's all sorts of intermediate ones with middle amounts of carbon. You've probably heard of benzene rings  they're very carcinogenic. And it goes all the way over to these big  thick  galumphy ones that have hundreds of carbons  and they have thousands of hydrogens  and they have vanadium and heavy metals and sulfur and all kinds of craziness hanging off the sides of them. Those are called the asphaltenes  they're an ingredient in asphalt. They're very important in oil spills. Let me tell you a little bit about the chemistry of oil in water. It is this chemistry that makes oil so disastrous. Oil doesn't sink  it floats. If it sank  it would be a whole different story as far as an oil spill. And the other thing it does is it spreads out the moment it hits the water. It spreads out to be really thin  so you have a hard time corralling it. The next thing that happens is the light ends evaporate  and some of the toxic things float into the water column and kill fish eggs and smaller fish and things like that  and shrimp. And then the asphaltenes    and this is the crucial thing    the asphaltenes get whipped by the waves into a frothy emulsion  something like mayonnaise. It triples the amount of oily  messy goo that you have in the water  and it makes it very hard to handle. It also makes it very viscous. When the Prestige sank off the coast of Spain  there were big  floating cushions the size of sofa cushions of emulsified oil  with the consistency  or the viscosity  of chewing gum. It's incredibly hard to clean up. And every single oil is different when it hits water. When the chemistry of the oil and water also hits our politics  it's absolutely explosive. For the first time  American consumers will kind of see the oil supply chain in front of themselves. They have a  eureka   moment  when we suddenly understand oil in a different context. So I'm going to talk just a little bit about the origin of these politics  because it's really crucial to understanding why this summer is so important  why we need to stay focused. Nobody gets up in the morning and thinks   Wow  I'm going to go buy some three carbon to    carbon molecules to put in my tank and drive happily to work.  No  they think   Ugh. I have to go buy gas. I'm so angry about it. The oil companies are ripping me off. They set the prices  and I don't even know. I am helpless over this.  And this is what happens to us at the gas pump    and actually  gas pumps are specifically designed to diffuse that anger. You might notice that many gas pumps  including this one  are designed to look like ATMs. I've talked to engineers. That's specifically to diffuse our anger  because supposedly we feel good about ATMs. That shows you how bad it is. But actually  I mean  this feeling of helplessness comes in because most Americans actually feel that oil prices are the result of a conspiracy  not of the vicissitudes of the world oil market. And the thing is  too  is that we also feel very helpless about the amount that we consume  which is somewhat reasonable  because in fact  we have designed this system where  if you want to get a job  it's much more important to have a car that runs  to have a job and keep a job  than to have a GED. And that's actually very perverse. Now there's another perverse thing about the way we buy gas  which is that we'd rather be doing anything else. This is BP's gas station in downtown Los Angeles. It is green. It is a shrine to greenishness.  Now   you think   why would something so lame work on people so smart   Well  the reason is  is because  when we're buying gas  we're very invested in this sort of cognitive dissonance. I mean  we're angry at the one hand and we want to be somewhere else. We don't want to be buying oil  we want to be doing something green. And we get kind of in on our own con. I mean    and this is funny  it looks funny here. But in fact  that's why the slogan  beyond petroleum  worked. But it's an inherent part of our energy policy  which is we don't talk about reducing the amount of oil that we use. We talk about energy independence. We talk about hydrogen cars. We talk about biofuels that haven't been invented yet. And so  cognitive dissonance is part and parcel of the way that we deal with oil  and it's really important to dealing with this oil spill. Okay  so the politics of oil are very moral in the United States. The oil industry is like a huge  gigantic octopus of engineering and finance and everything else  but we actually see it in very moral terms. This is an early on photograph    you can see  we had these gushers. Early journalists looked at these spills  and they said   This is a filthy industry.  But they also saw in it that people were getting rich for doing nothing. They weren't farmers  they were just getting rich for stuff coming out of the ground. It's the  Beverly Hillbillies   basically. But in the beginning  this was seen as a very morally problematic thing  long before it became funny. And then  of course  there was John D. Rockefeller. And the thing about John D. is that he went into this chaotic wild east of oil industry  and he rationalized it into a vertically integrated company  a multinational. It was terrifying  you think Walmart is a terrifying business model now  imagine what this looked like in the     s or     s. And it also the kind of root of how we see oil as a conspiracy. But what's really amazing is that Ida Tarbell  the journalist  went in and did a big expos  of Rockefeller and actually got the whole antitrust laws put in place. But in many ways  that image of the conspiracy still sticks with us. And here's one of the things that Ida Tarbell said    she said   He has a thin nose like a thorn. There were no lips. There were puffs under the little colorless eyes with creases running from them.  Okay  so that guy is actually still with us. I mean  this is a very pervasive    this is part of our DNA. And then there's this guy  okay. So  you might be wondering why it is that  every time we have high oil prices or an oil spill  we call these CEOs down to Washington  and we sort of pepper them with questions in public and we try to shame them. And this is something that we've been doing since       when we first asked them   Why are there these obscene profits   And we've sort of personalized the whole oil industry into these CEOs. And we take it as  you know    we look at it on a moral level  rather than looking at it on a legal and financial level. And so I'm not saying these guys aren't liable to answer questions    I'm just saying that  when you focus on whether they are or are not a bunch of greedy bastards  you don't actually get around to the point of making laws that are either going to either change the way they operate  or you're going to get around to really reducing the amount of oil and reducing our dependence on oil. So I'm saying this is kind of a distraction. But it makes for good theater  and it's powerfully cathartic as you probably saw last week. So the thing about water oil spills is that they are very politically galvanizing. I mean  these pictures    this is from the Santa Barbara spill. You have these pictures of birds. They really influence people. When the Santa Barbara spill happened in       it formed the environmental movement in its modern form. It started Earth Day. It also put in place the National Environmental Policy Act  the Clean Air Act  the Clean Water Act. Everything that we are really stemmed from this period. I think it's important to kind of look at these pictures of the birds and understand what happens to us. Here we are normally  we're standing at the gas pump  and we're feeling kind of helpless. We look at these pictures and we understand  for the first time  our role in this supply chain. We connect the dots in the supply chain. And we have this kind of    as voters  we have kind of a  eureka   moment. This is why these moments of these oil spills are so important. But it's also really important that we don't get distracted by the theater or the morals of it. We actually need to go in and work on the roots of the problem. One of the things that happened with the two previous oil spills was that we really worked on some of the symptoms. We were very reactive  as opposed to being proactive about what happened. And so what we did was  actually  we made moratoriums on the east and west coasts on drilling. We stopped drilling in ANWR  but we didn't actually reduce the amount of oil that we consumed. In fact  it's continued to increase. The only thing that really reduces the amount of oil that we consume is much higher prices. As you can see  our own production has fallen off as our reservoirs have gotten old and expensive to drill out. We only have two percent of the world's oil reserves     percent of them are in the Persian Gulf. One of the things that's happened because of this is that  since       the country of Nigeria  or the part of Nigeria that pumps oil  which is the delta    which is two times the size of Maryland    has had thousands of oil spills a year. I mean  we've essentially been exporting oil spills when we import oil from places without tight environmental regulations. That has been the equivalent of an Exxon Valdez spill every year since     . And we can wrap our heads around the spills  because that's what we see here  but in fact  these guys actually live in a war zone. There's a thousand battle related deaths a year in this area twice the size of Maryland  and it's all related to the oil. And these guys  I mean  if they were in the U.S.  they might be actually here in this room. They have degrees in political science  degrees in business    they're entrepreneurs. They don't actually want to be doing what they're doing. And it's sort of one of the other groups of people who pay a price for us. The other thing that we've done  as we've continued to increase demand  is that we kind of play a shell game with the costs. One of the places we put in a big oil project in Chad  with Exxon. So the U.S. taxpayer paid for it  the World Bank  Exxon paid for it. We put it in. There was a tremendous banditry problem. I was there in     . We were driving along this dark  dark road  and the guy in the green stepped out  and I was just like   Ahhh  This is it.  And then the guy in the Exxon uniform stepped out  and we realized it was okay. They have their own private sort of army around them at the oil fields. But at the same time  Chad has become much more unstable  and we are not paying for that price at the pump. We pay for it in our taxes on April   th. We do the same thing with the price of policing the Persian Gulf and keeping the shipping lanes open. This is         we actually bombed two Iranian oil platforms that year. That was the beginning of an escalating U.S. involvement there that we do not pay for at the pump. We pay for it on April   th  and we can't even calculate the cost of this involvement. The other place that is sort of supporting our dependence on oil and our increased consumption is the Gulf of Mexico  which was not part of the moratoriums. Now what's happened in the Gulf of Mexico    as you can see  this is the Minerals Management diagram of wells for gas and oil. It's become this intense industrialized zone. It doesn't have the same resonance for us that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has  but it should  I mean  it's a bird sanctuary. Also  every time you buy gasoline in the United States  half of it is actually being refined along the coast  because the Gulf actually has about    percent of our refining capacity and a lot of our marine terminals as well. So the people of the Gulf have essentially been subsidizing the rest of us through a less clean environment. And finally  American families also pay a price for oil. Now on the one hand  the price at the pump is not really very high when you consider the actual cost of the oil  but on the other hand  the fact that people have no other transit options means that they pay a large amount of their income into just getting back and forth to work  generally in a fairly crummy car. If you look at people who make         a year  they have two kids  they might have three jobs or more  and then they have to really commute. They're actually spending more on their car and fuel than they are on taxes or on health care. And the same thing happens at the   th percentile  around       . Gasoline costs are a tremendous drain on the American economy  but they're also a drain on individual families and it's kind of terrifying to think about what happens when prices get higher. So  what I'm going to talk to you about now is  what do we have to do this time  What are the laws  What do we have to do to keep ourselves focused  One thing is    we need to stay away from the theater. We need to stay away from the moratoriums. We need to focus really back again on the molecules. The moratoriums are fine  but we do need to focus on the molecules on the oil. One of the things that we also need to do  is we need to try to not kind of fool ourselves into thinking that you can have a green world  before you reduce the amount of oil that we use. We need to focus on reducing the oil. What you see in this top drawing is a schematic of how petroleum gets used in the U.S. economy. It comes in on the side    the useful stuff is the dark gray  and the un useful stuff  which is called the rejected energy    the waste  goes up to the top. Now you can see that the waste far outweighs the actually useful amount. And one of the things that we need to do is  not only fix the fuel efficiency of our vehicles and make them much more efficient  but we also need to fix the economy in general. We need to remove the perverse incentives to use more fuel. For example  we have an insurance system where the person who drives        miles a year pays the same insurance as somebody who drives      . We actually encourage people to drive more. We have policies that reward sprawl    we have all kinds of policies. We need to have more mobility choices. We need to make the gas price better reflect the real cost of oil. And we need to shift subsidies from the oil industry  which is at least    billion dollars a year  into something that allows middle class people to find better ways to commute. Whether that's getting a much more efficient car and also kind of building markets for new cars and new fuels down the road  this is where we need to be. We need to kind of rationalize this whole thing  and you can find more about this policy. It's called STRONG  which is  Secure Transportation Reducing Oil Needs Gradually   and the idea is instead of being helpless  we need to be more strong. They're up at NewAmerica.net. What's important about these is that we try to move from feeling helpless at the pump  to actually being active and to really sort of thinking about who we are  having kind of that special moment  where we connect the dots actually at the pump. Now supposedly  oil taxes are the third rail of American politics    the no fly zone. I actually    I agree that a dollar a gallon on oil is probably too much  but I think that if we started this year with three cents a gallon on gasoline  and upped it to six cents next year  nine cents the following year  all the way up to    cents by       that we could actually significantly reduce our gasoline consumption  and at the same time we would give people time to prepare  time to respond  and we would be raising money and raising consciousness at the same time. Let me give you a little sense of how this would work. This is a gas receipt  hypothetically  for a year from now. The first thing that you have on the tax is    you have a tax for a stronger America       cents. So you're not helpless at the pump. And the second thing that you have is a kind of warning sign  very similar to what you would find on a cigarette pack. And what it says is   The National Academy of Sciences estimates that every gallon of gas you burn in your car creates    cents in health care costs.  That's a lot. And so this    you can see that you're paying considerably less than the health care costs on the tax. And also  the hope is that you start to be connected to the whole greater system. And at the same time  you have a number that you can call to get more information on commuting  or a low interest loan on a different kind of car  or whatever it is you're going to need to actually reduce your gasoline dependence. With this whole sort of suite of policies  we could actually reduce our gasoline consumption    or our oil consumption    by    percent by     . So  three million barrels a day. But in order to do this  one of the things we really need to do  is we need to remember we are people of the hydrocarbon. We need to keep or minds on the molecules and not get distracted by the theater  not get distracted by the cognitive dissonance of the green possibilities that are out there. We need to kind of get down and do the gritty work of reducing our dependence upon this fuel and these molecules. Thank you. So I work in marketing  which I love  but my first passion was physics  a passion brought to me by a wonderful school teacher  when I had a little less gray hair. So he taught me that physics is cool because it teaches us so much about the world around us. And I'm going to spend the next few minutes trying to convince you that physics can teach us something about marketing. So quick show of hands    who studied some marketing in university  Who studied some physics in university  Pretty good. And at school  Okay  lots of you. So  hopefully this will bring back some happy  or possibly some slightly disturbing memories. So  physics and marketing. We'll start with something very simple    Newton's Law   The force equals mass times acceleration.  This is something that perhaps Turkish Airlines should have studied a bit more carefully before they ran this campaign. But if we rearrange this formula quickly  we can get to acceleration equals force over mass  which means that for a larger particle    a larger mass    it requires more force to change its direction. It's the same with brands  the more massive a brand  the more baggage it has  the more force is needed to change its positioning. And that's one of the reasons why Arthur Andersen chose to launch Accenture rather than try to persuade the world that Andersen's could stand for something other than accountancy. It explains why Hoover found it very difficult to persuade the world that it was more than vacuum cleaners  and why companies like Unilever and P G keep brands separate  like Ariel and Pringles and Dove rather than having one giant parent brand. So the physics is that the bigger the mass of an object the more force is needed to change its direction. The marketing is  the bigger a brand  the more difficult it is to reposition it. So think about a portfolio of brands or maybe new brands for new ventures. Now  who remembers Heisenberg's uncertainty principle  Getting a little more technical now. So this says that it's impossible  by definition  to measure exactly the state    i.e.  the position    and the momentum of a particle  because the act of measuring it  by definition  changes it. So to explain that    if you've got an elementary particle and you shine a light on it  then the photon of light has momentum  which knocks the particle  so you don't know where it was before you looked at it. By measuring it  the act of measurement changes it. The act of observation changes it. It's the same in marketing. So with the act of observing consumers  changes their behavior. Think about the group of moms who are talking about their wonderful children in a focus group  and almost none of them buy lots of junk food. And yet  McDonald's sells hundreds of millions of burgers every year. Think about the people who are on accompanied shops in supermarkets  who stuff their trolleys full of fresh green vegetables and fruit  but don't shop like that any other day. And if you think about the number of people who claim in surveys to regularly look for porn on the Web  it's very few. Yet  at Google  we know it's the number one searched for category. So luckily  the science    no  sorry    the marketing is getting easier. Luckily  with now better point of sale tracking  more digital media consumption  you can measure more what consumers actually do  rather than what they say they do. So the physics is you can never accurately and exactly measure a particle  because the observation changes it. The marketing is    the message for marketing is    that try to measure what consumers actually do  rather than what they say they'll do or anticipate they'll do. So next  the scientific method    an axiom of physics  of all science    says you cannot prove a hypothesis through observation  you can only disprove it. What this means is you can gather more and more data around a hypothesis or a positioning  and it will strengthen it  but it will not conclusively prove it. And only one contrary data point can blow your theory out of the water. So if we take an example    Ptolemy had dozens of data points to support his theory that the planets would rotate around the Earth. It only took one robust observation from Copernicus to blow that idea out of the water. And there are parallels for marketing    you can invest for a long time in a brand  but a single contrary observation of that positioning will destroy consumers' belief. Take BP    they spent millions of pounds over many years building up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand  but then one little accident. Think about Toyota. It was  for a long time  revered as the most reliable of cars  and then they had the big recall incident. And Tiger Woods  for a long time  the perfect brand ambassador. Well  you know the story. So the physics is that you cannot prove a hypothesis  but it's easy to disprove it    any hypothesis is shaky. And the marketing is that not matter how much you've invested in your brand  one bad week can undermine decades of good work. So be really careful to try and avoid the screw ups that can undermine your brand. And lastly  to the slightly obscure world of entropy    the second law of thermodynamics. This says that entropy  which is a measure of the disorder of a system  will always increase. The same is true of marketing. If we go back    years  the one message pretty much controlled by one marketing manager could pretty much define a brand. But where we are today  things have changed. You can get a strong brand image or a message and put it out there like the Conservative Party did earlier this year with their election poster. But then you lose control of it. With the kind of digital comment creation and distribution tools that are available now to every consumer  it's impossible to control where it goes. Your brand starts being dispersed  it gets more chaotic. It's out of your control. I actually saw him speak    he did a good job. But while this may be unsettling for marketers  it's actually a good thing. This distribution of brand energy gets your brand closer to the people  more in with the people. It makes this distribution of energy a democratizing force  which is ultimately good for your brand. So  the lesson from physics is that entropy will always increase  it's a fundamental law. The message for marketing is that your brand is more dispersed. You can't fight it  so embrace it and find a way to work with it. So to close  my teacher  Mr. Vutter  told me that physics is cool  and hopefully  I've convinced you that physics can teach all of us  even in the world of marketing  something special. Thank you. Martin Luther King did not say   I have a nightmare   when he inspired the civil rights movements. He said   I have a dream.  And I have a dream. I have a dream that we can stop thinking that the future will be a nightmare  and this is going to be a challenge  because  if you think of every major blockbusting film of recent times  nearly all of its visions for humanity are apocalyptic. I think this film is one of the hardest watches of modern times   The Road.  It's a beautiful piece of filmmaking  but everything is desolate  everything is dead. And just a father and son trying to survive  walking along the road. And I think the environmental movement of which I am a part of has been complicit in creating this vision of the future. For too long  we have peddled a nightmarish vision of what's going to happen. We have focused on the worst case scenario. We have focused on the problems. And we have not thought enough about the solutions. We've used fear  if you like  to grab people's attention. And any psychologist will tell you that fear in the organism is linked to flight mechanism. It's part of the fight and flight mechanism  that when an animal is frightened    think of a deer. A deer freezes very  very still  poised to run away. And I think that's what we're doing when we're asking people to engage with our agenda around environmental degradation and climate change. People are freezing and running away because we're using fear. And I think the environmental movement has to grow up and start to think about what progress is. What would it be like to be improving the human lot  And one of the problems that we face  I think  is that the only people that have cornered the market in terms of progress is a financial definition of what progress is  an economic definition of what progress is    that somehow  if we get the right numbers to go up  we're going to be better off  whether that's on the stock market  whether that's with GDP and economic growth  that somehow life is going to get better. This is somehow appealing to human greed instead of fear    that more is better. Come on. In the Western world  we have enough. Maybe some parts of the world don't  but we have enough. And we've know for a long time that this is not a good measure of the welfare of nations. In fact  the architect of our national accounting system  Simon Kuznets  in the     s  said that   A nation's welfare can scarcely be inferred from their national income.  But we've created a national accounting system which is firmly based on production and producing stuff. And indeed  this is probably historical  and it had its time. In the second World War  we needed to produce a lot of stuff. And indeed  we were so successful at producing certain types of stuff that we destroyed a lot of Europe  and we had to rebuild it afterwards. And so our national accounting system became fixated on what we can produce. But as early as       this visionary man  Robert Kennedy  at the start of his ill fated presidential campaign  gave the most eloquent deconstruction of gross national product that ever has been. And he finished his talk with the phrase  that   The gross national product measures everything except that which makes life worthwhile.  How crazy is that  That our measure of progress  our dominant measure of progress in society  is measuring everything except that which makes life worthwhile  I believe  if Kennedy was alive today  he would be asking statisticians such as myself to go out and find out what makes life worthwhile. He'd be asking us to redesign our national accounting system to be based upon such important things as social justice  sustainability and people's well being. And actually  social scientists have already gone out and asked these questions around the world. This is from a global survey. It's asking people  what do they want. And unsurprisingly  people all around the world say that what they want is happiness  for themselves  for their families  their children  their communities. Okay  they think money is slightly important. It's there  but it's not nearly as important as happiness  and it's not nearly as important as love. We all need to love and be loved in life. It's not nearly as important as health. We want to be healthy and live a full life. These seem to be natural human aspirations. Why are statisticians not measuring these  Why are we not thinking of the progress of nations in these terms  instead of just how much stuff we have  And really  this is what I've done with my adult life    is think about how do we measure happiness  how do we measure well being  how can we do that within environmental limits. And we created  at the organization that I work for  the New Economics Foundation  something we call the Happy Planet Index  because we think people should be happy and the planet should be happy. Why don't we create a measure of progress that shows that  And what we do  is we say that the ultimate outcome of a nation is how successful is it at creating happy and healthy lives for its citizens. That should be the goal of every nation on the planet. But we have to remember that there's a fundamental input to that  and that is how many of the planet's resources we use. We all have one planet. We all have to share it. It is the ultimate scarce resource  the one planet that we share. And economics is very interested in scarcity. When it has a scarce resource that it wants to turn into a desirable outcome  it thinks in terms of efficiency. It thinks in terms of how much bang do we get for our buck. And this is a measure of how much well being we get for our planetary resource use. It is an efficiency measure. And probably the easiest way to show you that  is to show you this graph. Running horizontally along the graph  is  ecological footprint   which is a measure of how much resources we use and how much pressure we put on the planet. More is bad. Running vertically upwards  is a measure called  happy life years.  It's about the well being of nations. It's like a happiness adjusted life expectancy. It's like quality and quantity of life in nations. And the yellow dot there you see  is the global average. Now  there's a huge array of nations around that global average. To the top right of the graph  are countries which are doing reasonably well and producing well being  but they're using a lot of planet to get there. They are the U.S.A.  other Western countries going across in those triangles and a few Gulf states in there actually. Conversely  at the bottom left of the graph  are countries that are not producing much well being    typically  sub Saharan Africa. In Hobbesian terms  life is short and brutish there. The average life expectancy in many of these countries is only    years. Malaria  HIV AIDS are killing a lot of people in these regions of the world. But now for the good news  There are some countries up there  yellow triangles  that are doing better than global average  that are heading up towards the top left of the graph. This is an aspirational graph. We want to be top left  where good lives don't cost the earth. They're Latin American. The country on its own up at the top is a place I haven't been to. Maybe some of you have. Costa Rica. Costa Rica    average life expectancy is    and a half years. That is longer than in the USA. They are  according to the latest Gallup world poll  the happiest nation on the planet    than anybody  more than Switzerland and Denmark. They are the happiest place. They are doing that on a quarter of the resources that are used typically in  the  Western world    a quarter of the resources. What's going on there  What's happening in Costa Rica  We can look at some of the data.    percent of their electricity comes from renewable resources. Their government is one of the first to commit to be carbon neutral by     . They abolished the army in             . And they invested in social programs    health and education. They have one of the highest literacy rates in Latin America and in the world. And they have that Latin vibe  don't they. They have the social connectedness. The challenge is  that possibly    and the thing we might have to think about    is that the future might not be North American  might not be Western European. It might be Latin American. And the challenge  really  is to pull the global average up here. That's what we need to do. And if we're going to do that  we need to pull countries from the bottom  and we need to pull countries from the right of the graph. And then we're starting to create a happy planet. That's one way of looking at it. Another way of looking at it is looking at time trends. We don't have good data going back for every country in the world  but for some of the richest countries  the OECD group  we do. And this is the trend in well being over that time  a small increase  but this is the trend in ecological footprint. And so in strict happy planet methodology  we've become less efficient at turning our ultimate scarce resource into the outcome we want to. And the point really is  is that I think  probably everybody in this room would like society to get to      without an apocalyptic something happening. It's actually not very long away. It's half a human lifetime away. A child entering school today will be my age in     . This is not the very distant future. This is what the U.K. government target on carbon and greenhouse emissions looks like. And I put it to you  that is not business as usual. That is changing our business. That is changing the way we create our organizations  we do our government policy and we live our lives. And the point is  we need to carry on increasing well being. No one can go to the polls and say that quality of life is going to reduce. None of us  I think  want human progress to stop. I think we want it to carry on. I think we want the lot of humanity to keep on increasing. And I think this is where climate change skeptics and deniers come in. I think this is what they want. They want quality of life to keep increasing. They want to hold on to what they've got. And if we're going to engage them  I think that's what we've got to do. And that means we have to really increase efficiency even more. Now that's all very easy to draw graphs and things like that  but the point is we need to turn those curves. And this is where I think we can take a leaf out of systems theory  systems engineers  where they create feedback loops  put the right information at the right point of time. Human beings are very motivated by the  now.  You put a smart meter in your home  and you see how much electricity you're using right now  how much it's costing you  your kids go around and turn the lights off pretty quickly. What would that look like for society  Why is it  on the radio news every evening  I hear the FTSE      the Dow Jones  the dollar pound ratio    I don't even know which way the dollar pound ratio should go to be good news. And why do I hear that  Why don't I hear how much energy Britain used yesterday  or American used yesterday  Did we meet our three percent annual target on reducing carbon emissions  That's how you create a collective goal. You put it out there into the media and start thinking about it. And we need positive feedback loops for increasing well being At a government level  they might create national accounts of well being. At a business level  you might look at the well being of your employees  which we know is really linked to creativity  which is linked to innovation  and we're going to need a lot of innovation to deal with those environmental issues. At a personal level  we need these nudges too. Maybe we don't quite need the data  but we need reminders. In the U.K.  we have a strong public health message on five fruit and vegetables a day and how much exercise we should do    never my best thing. What are these for happiness  What are the five things that you should do every day to be happier  We did a project for the Government Office of Science a couple of years ago  a big program called the Foresight program    lots and lots of people    involved lots of experts    everything evidence based    a huge tome. But a piece of work we did was on  what five positive actions can you do to improve well being in your life  And the point of these is they are  not quite  the secrets of happiness  but they are things that I think happiness will flow out the side from. And the first of these is to connect  is that your social relationships are the most important cornerstones of your life. Do you invest the time with your loved ones that you could do  and energy  Keep building them. The second one is be active. The fastest way out of a bad mood  step outside  go for a walk  turn the radio on and dance. Being active is great for our positive mood. The third one is take notice. How aware are you of things going on around the world  the seasons changing  people around you  Do you notice what's bubbling up for you and trying to emerge  Based on a lot of evidence for mindfulness  cognitive behavioral therapy   very  strong for our well being. The fourth is keep learning and keep is important    learning throughout the whole life course. Older people who keep learning and are curious  they have much better health outcomes than those who start to close down. But it doesn't have to be formal learning  it's not knowledge based. It's more curiosity. It can be learning to cook a new dish  picking up an instrument you forgot as a child. Keep learning. And the final one is that most anti economic of activities  but give. Our generosity  our altruism  our compassion  are all hardwired to the reward mechanism in our brain. We feel good if we give. You can do an experiment where you give two groups of people a hundred dollars in the morning. You tell one of them to spend it on themselves and one on other people. You measure their happiness at the end of the day  those that have gone and spent on other people are much happier that those that spent it on themselves. And these five ways  which we put onto these handy postcards  I would say  don't have to cost the earth. They don't have any carbon content. They don't need a lot of material goods to be satisfied. And so I think it's really quite feasible that happiness does not cost the earth. Now  Martin Luther King  on the eve of his death  gave an incredible speech. He said   I know there are challenges ahead  there may be trouble ahead  but I fear no one. I don't care. I have been to the mountain top  and I have seen the Promised Land.  Now  he was a preacher  but I believe the environmental movement and  in fact  the business community  government  needs to go to the top of the mountain top  and it needs to look out  and it needs to see the Promised Land  or the land of promise  and it needs to have a vision of a world that we all want. And not only that  we need to create a Great Transition to get there  and we need to pave that great transition with good things. Human beings want to be happy. Pave them with the five ways. And we need to have signposts gathering people together and pointing them    something like the Happy Planet Index. And then I believe that we can all create a world we all want  where happiness does not cost the earth. We live on a human dominated planet  putting unprecedented pressure on the systems on Earth. This is bad news  but perhaps surprising to you  it's also part of the good news. We're the first generation    thanks to science    to be informed that we may be undermining the stability and the ability of planet Earth to support human development as we know it. It's also good news  because the planetary risks we're facing are so large  that business as usual is not an option. In fact  we're in a phase where transformative change is necessary  which opens the window for innovation  for new ideas and new paradigms. This is a scientific journey on the challenges facing humanity in the global phase of sustainability. On this journey  I'd like to bring  apart from yourselves  a good friend  a stakeholder  who's always absent when we deal with the negotiations on environmental issues  a stakeholder who refuses to compromise    planet Earth. So I thought I'd bring her with me today on stage  to have her as a witness of a remarkable journey  which humbly reminds us of the period of grace we've had over the past        years. This is the living conditions on the planet over the last         years. It's a very important period    it's roughly half the period when we've been fully modern humans on the planet. We've had the same  roughly  abilities that developed civilizations as we know it. This is the environmental conditions on the planet. Here  used as a proxy  temperature variability. It was a jumpy ride.        years back in a crisis  we leave Africa  we colonize Australia in another crisis         years back  we leave Asia for Europe in another crisis         years back  and then we enter the remarkably stable Holocene phase  the only period in the whole history of the planet  that we know of  that can support human development. A thousand years into this period  we abandon our hunting and gathering patterns. We go from a couple of million people to the seven billion people we are today. The Mesopotamian culture  we invent agriculture  we domesticate animals and plants. You have the Roman  the Greek and the story as you know it. The only phase  as we know it that can support humanity. The trouble is we're putting a quadruple sqeeze on this poor planet  a quadruple sqeeze  which  as its first squeeze  has population growth of course. Now  this is not only about numbers  this is not only about the fact that we're seven billion people committed to nine billion people  it's an equity issue as well. The majority of the environmental impacts on the planet have been caused by the rich minority  the    percent that jumped onto the industrial bandwagon in the mid   th century. The majority of the planet  aspiring for development  having the right for development  are in large aspiring for an unsustainable lifestyle  a momentous pressure. The second pressure on the planet is  of course the climate agenda    the big issue    where the policy interpretation of science is that it would be enough to stabilize greenhouse gases at     ppm to avoid average temperatures exceeding two degrees  to avoid the risk that we may be destabilizing the West Antarctic Ice Sheet  holding six meters    level rising  the risk of destabilizing the Greenland Ice Sheet  holding another seven meters    sea level rising. Now  you would have wished the climate pressure to hit a strong planet  a resilient planet  but unfortunately  the third pressure is the ecosystem decline. Never have we seen  in the past    years  such a sharp decline of ecosystem functions and services on the planet  one of them being the ability to regulate climate on the long term  in our forests  land and biodiversity. The forth pressure is surprise  the notion and the evidence that we need to abandon our old paradigm  that ecosystems behave linearly  predictably  controllably in our    so to say    linear systems  and that in fact  surprise is universal  as systems tip over very rapidly  abruptly and often irreversibly. This  dear friends  poses a human pressure on the planet of momentous scale. We may  in fact  have entered a new geological era    the Anthropocene  where humans are the predominant driver of change at a planetary level. Now  as a scientist  what's the evidence for this  Well  the evidence is  unfortunately  ample. It's not only carbon dioxide that has this hockey stick pattern of accelerated change. You can take virtually any parameter that matters for human well being    nitrous oxide  methane  deforestation  overfishing land degredation  loss of species    they all show the same pattern over the past     years. Simultaneously  they branch off in the mid   s     years after the Second World War  showing very clearly that the great acceleration of the human enterprise starts in the mid   s. You see  for the first time  an imprint on the global level. And I can tell you  you enter the disciplinary research in each of these  you find something remarkably important  the conclusion that we may have come to the point where we have to bend the curves  that we may have entered the most challenging and exciting decade in the history humanity on the planet  the decade when we have to bend the curves. Now  as if this was not enough    to just bend the curves and understanding the accelerated pressure on the planet    we also have to recognize the fact that systems do have multiple stable states  separated by thresholds    illustrated here by this ball and cup diagram  where the depth of the cup is the resilience of the system. Now  the system may gradually    under pressure of climate change  erosion  biodiversity loss    lose the depth of the cup  the resilience  but appear to be healthy and appear to suddenly  under a threshold  be tipping over. Upff. Sorry. Changing state and literally ending up in an undesired situation  where new biophysical logic takes over  new species take over  and the system gets locked. Do we have evidence of this  Yes  coral reef systems. Biodiverse  low nutrient  hard coral systems under multiple pressures of overfishing  unsustainable tourism  climate change. A trigger and the system tips over  loses its resilience  soft corals take over  and we get undesired systems that cannot support economic and social development. The Arctic    a beautiful system    a regulating biome at the planetary level  taking the knock after knock on climate change  appearing to be in a good state. No scientist could predict that in       suddenly  what could be crossing a threshold. The system suddenly  very surprisingly  loses    to    percent of its summer ice cover. And the drama is  of course  that when the system does this  the logic may change. It may get locked in an undesired state  because it changes color  absorbs more energy  and the system may get stuck. In my mind  the largest red flag warning for humanity that we are in a precarious situation. As a sideline  you know that the only red flag that popped up here was a submarine from an unnamed country that planted a red flag at the bottom of the Arctic to be able to control the oil resources. Now  if we have evidence  which we now have  that wetlands  forests   unclear  monsoon system  the rainforests  behave in this nonlinear way.    or so scientists around the world gathered and asked a question for the first time   Do we have to put the planet into the the pot   So we have to ask ourselves  are we threatening this extraordinarily stable Holocene state  Are we in fact putting ourselves in a situation where we're coming too close to thresholds that could lead to deleterious and very undesired  if now catastrophic  change for human development  You know  you don't want to stand there. In fact  you're not even allowed to stand where this gentleman is standing  at the foaming  slippery waters at the threshold. In fact  there's a fence quite upstream of this threshold  beyond which you are in a danger zone. And this is the new paradigm  which we gathered two  three years back  recognizing that our old paradigm of just analyzing and pushing and predicting parameters into the future  aiming at minimalizing environmental impacts  is of the past. Now we to ask ourselves  which are the large environmental processes that we have to be stewards of to keep ourselves safe in the Holocene  And could we even  thanks to major advancements in Earth systems science  identify the thresholds  the points where we may expect nonlinear change  And could we even define a planetary boundary  a fence  within which we then have a safe operating space for humanity  This work  which was published in  Nature   late       after a number of years of analysis  led to the final proposition that we can only find nine planetary boundaries with which  under active stewardship  would allow ourselves to have a safe operating space. These include  of course  climate. It may surprise you that it's not only climate. But it shows that we are interconnected  among many systems on the planet  with the three big systems  climate change  stratospheric ozone depletion and ocean acidification being the three big systems  where the scientific evidence of large scale thresholds in the paleo record of the history of the planet. But we also include  what we call  the slow variables  the systems that  under the hood  regulate and buffer the capacity of the resilience of the planet    the interference of the big nitrogen and phosphorus cycles on the planet  land use change  rate of biodiversity loss  freshwater use  functions which regulate biomass on the planet  carbon sequestration  diversity. And then we have two parameters which we were not able to quantify    air pollution  including warming gases and air polluting sulfates and nitrates  but also chemical pollution. Together  these form an integrated whole for guiding human development in the Anthropocene  understanding that the planet is a complex self regulating system. In fact  most evidence indicates that these nine may behave as three Musketeers   One for all. All for one.  You degrade forests  you go beyond the boundary on land  you undermine the ability of the climate system to stay stable. The drama here is  in fact  that it may show that the climate challenge is the easy one  if you consider the whole challenge of sustainable development. Now this is the Big Bang equivalent then of human development within the safe operating space of the planetary boundaries. What you see here in black line is the safe operating space  the quantified boundaries  as suggested by this analysis. The yellow dot in the middle here is our starting point  the pre industrial point  where we're very safely in the safe operating space. In the '  s  we start branching out. In the '  s already  through the green revolution and the Haber Bosch process of fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere    you know  human's today take out more nitrogen from the atmosphere than the whole biosphere does naturally as a whole. We don't transgress the climate boundary until the early '  s  actually  right after Rio. And today  we are in a situation where we estimate that we've transgressed three boundaries  the rate of biodiversity loss  which is the sixth extinction period in the history of humanity    one of them being the extinctions of the dinosaurs    nitrogen and climate change. But we still have some degrees of freedom on the others  but we are approaching fast on land  water  phosphorus and oceans. But this gives a new paradigm to guide humanity  to put the light on our  so far overpowered industrial vehicle  which operates as if we're only on a dark  straight highway. Now the question then is  how gloomy is this  Is then sustainable development utopia  Well  there's no science to suggest. In fact  there is ample science to indicate that we can do this transformative change  that we have the ability to now move into a new innovative  a transformative gear  across scales. The drama is  of course  is that     countries on this planet have to simultaneously start moving in the same direction. But it changes fundamentally our governance and management paradigm  from the current linear  command and control thinking  looking at efficiencies and optimization towards a much more flexible  a much more adaptive approach  where we recognize that redundancy  both in social and environmental systems  is key to be able to deal with a turbulent era of global change. We have to invest in persistence  in the ability of social systems and ecological systems to withstand shocks and still remain in that desired cup. We have to invest in transformations capability  moving from crisis into innovation and the ability to rise after a crisis  and of course to adapt to unavoidable change. This is a new paradigm. We're not doing that at any scale on governance. But is it happening anywhere  Do we have any examples of success on this mind shift being applied at the local level  Well  yes  in fact we do and the list can start becoming longer and longer. There's good news here  for example  from Latin America  where plow based farming systems of the '  s and '  s led farming basically to a dead end  with lower and lower yields  degrading the organic matter and fundamental problems at the livelihood levels in Paraguay  Uruguay and a number of countries  Brazil  leading to innovation and entrepreneurship among farmers in partnership with scientists into an agricultural revolution of zero tillage systems combined with mulch farming with locally adapted technologies  which today  for example  in some countries  have led to a tremendous increase in area under mulch  zero till farming which  not only produces more food  but also sequesters carbon. The Australian Great Barrier Reef is another success story. Under the realization from tourist operators  fishermen  the Australian Great Barrier Reef Authority and scientists that the Great Barrier Reef is doomed under the current governance regime. Global change  beautification rack culture  overfishing and unsustainable tourism  all together placing this system in the realization of crisis. But the window of opportunity was innovation and new mindset  which today has led to a completely new governance strategy to build resilience  acknowledge redundancy and invest in the whole system as an integrated whole  and then allow for much more redundancy in the system. Sweden  the country I come from  has other examples  where wetlands in southern Sweden were seen as    as in many countries    as flood prone polluted nuisance in the peri urban regions. But again  a crisis  new partnerships  actors locally  transforming these into a key component of sustainable urban planning. So crisis leading into opportunities. Now  what about the future  Well  the future  of course  has one massive challenge  which is feeding a world of nine billion people. We need nothing less than a new green revolution  and the planet boundaries shows that agriculture has to go from a source of greenhouse gases to a sink. It has to basically do this on current land. We cannot expand anymore  because it erodes the planetary boundaries. We cannot continue consuming water as we do today  with    percent of world rivers not even reaching the ocean. And we need a transformation. Well  interestingly  and based on my work and others in Africa  for example  we've shown that even the most vulnerable small scale rainfall farming systems  with innovations and supplementary irrigation to bridge dry spells and droughts  sustainable sanitation systems to close the loop on nutrients from toilets back to farmers' fields  and innovations in tillage systems  we can triple  quadruple  yield levels on current land. Elinor Ostrom  the latest Nobel laureate of economics  clearly shows empirically across the world that we can govern the commons if we invest in trust  local  action based partnerships and cross scale institutional innovations  where local actors  together  can deal with the global commons at a large scale. But even on the hard policy area we have innovations. We know that we have to move from our fossil dependence very quickly into a low carbon economy in record time. And what shall we do  Everybody talks about carbon taxes    it won't work    emission schemes  but for example  one policy measure  feed in tariffs on the energy system  which is already applied  from China doing it on offshore wind systems  all the way to the U.S. where you give the guaranteed price for investment in renewable energy  but you can subsidize electricity to poor people. You get people out of poverty. You solve the climate issue with regards to the energy sector  while at the same time  stimulating innovation    examples of things that can be out scaled quickly at the planetary level. So there is    no doubt    opportunity here  and we can list many  many examples of transformative opportunities around the planet. The key though in all of these  the red thread  is the shift in mindset  moving away from a situation where we simply are pushing ourselves into a dark future  where we instead backcast our future  and we say   What is the playing field on the planet  What are the planetary boundaries within which we can safely operate   and then backtrack innovations within that. But of course  the drama is  it clearly shows that incremental change is not an option. So  there is scientific evidence. They sort of say the harsh news  that we are facing the largest transformative development since the industrialization. In fact  what we have to do over the next    years is much more dramatic and more exciting than what we did when we moved into the situation we're in today. Now  science indicates that  yes  we can achieve a prosperous future within the safe operating space  if we move simultaneously  collaborating on a global level  from local to global scale  in transformative options  which build resilience on a finite planet. Thank you. Tyler Dewar  The way I feel right now is that all of the other speakers have said exactly what I wanted to say. And it seems that the only thing left for me to say is to thank you all for your kindness. TD  But maybe in the spirit of appreciating the kindness of you all  I could share with you a little story about myself. TD  From the time I was very young  onward  I was given a lot of different responsibilities  and it always seemed to me  when I was young  that everything was laid out before me. All of the plans for me were already made. I was given the clothes that I needed to wear and told where I needed to be  given these very precious and holy looking robes to wear  with the understanding that it was something sacred or important. TD  But before that kind of formal lifestyle happened for me  I was living in eastern Tibet with my family. And when I was seven years old  all of a sudden  a search party arrived at my home. They were looking the next Karmapa  and I noticed they were talking to my mom and dad  and the news came to me that they were telling me that I was the Karmapa. And these days  people ask me a lot  how did that feel. How did that feel when they came and whisked you away  and your lifestyle completely changed  And what I mostly say is that  at that time  it was a pretty interesting idea to me. I thought that things would be pretty fun and there would be more things to play with. TD  But it didn't turn out to be so fun and entertaining  as I thought it would have been. I was placed in a pretty strictly controlled environment. And immediately  a lot of different responsibilities  in terms of my education and so forth  were heaped upon me. I was separated  largely  from my family  including my mother and father. I didn't have have many personal friends to spend time with  but I was expected to perform these prescribed duties. So it turned out that my fantasy about an entertaining life of being the Karmapa wasn't going to come true. It more felt to be the case to me that I was being treated like a statue  and I was to sit in one place like a statue would. TD  Nevertheless  I felt that  even though I've been separated from my loved ones    and  of course  now I'm even further away. When I was     I escaped from Tibet and became even further removed from my mother and father  my relatives  my friends and my homeland. But nevertheless  there's no real sense of separation from me in my heart  in terms of the love that I feel for these people. I feel  still  a very strong connection of love for all of these people and for the land. TD  And I still do get to keep in touch with my mother and father  albeit infrequently. I talk to my mother once in a blue moon on the telephone. And my experience is that  when I'm talking to her  with every second that passes during our conversation  the feeling of love that binds us is bringing us closer and closer together. TD  So those were just a few remarks about my personal background. And in terms of other things that I wanted to share with you  in terms of ideas  I think it's wonderful to have a situation like this  where so many people from different backgrounds and places can come together  exchange their ideas and form relationships of friendship with each other. And I think that's symbolic of what we're seeing in the world in general  that the world is becoming smaller and smaller  and that all of the peoples in the world are enjoying more opportunities for connection. That's wonderful  but we should also remember that we should have a similar process happening on the inside. Along with outward development and increase of opportunity  there should be inward development and deepening of our heart connections as well as our outward connections. So we spoke and we heard some about design this week. I think that it's important for us to remember that we need to keep pushing forward on the endeavor of the design of the heart. We heard a lot about technology this week  and it's important for us to remember to invest a lot of our energy in improving the technology of the heart. TD  So  even though I'm somewhat happy about the wonderful developments that are happening in the world  still  I feel a sense of impediment  when it comes to the ability that we have to connect with each other on a heart to heart  or a mind to mind  level. I feel that there are some things that are getting in the way. TC  My relationship to this concept of heart to heart connection  or mind to mind connection  is an interesting one  because  as a spiritual leader  I'm always attempting to open my heart to others and offer myself up for heart to heart and mind to mind connections in a genuine way with other people  but at the same time  I've always been advised that I need to emphasize intelligence over the heart to heart connections  because  being someone in a position like mine  if I don't rely primarily on intelligence  then something dangerous may happen to me. So it's an interesting paradox at play there. But I had a really striking experience once  when a group from Afghanistan came to visit me  and we had a really interesting conversation. TD  So we ended up talking about the Bamiyan Buddhas  which  as you know  were destroyed some years ago in Afghanistan. But the basis of our conversation was the different approach to spirituality on the part of the Muslim and Buddhist traditions. Of course  in Muslim  because of the teachings around the concept of idolatry  you don't find as many physical representations of divinity or of spiritual liberation as you do in the Buddhist tradition  where  of course  there are many statues of the Buddha that are highly revered. So  we were talking about the differences between the traditions and what many people perceived as the tragedy of the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas  but I offered the suggestion that perhaps we could look at this in a positive way. What we saw in the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas was the depletion of matter  some solid substance falling down and disintegrating. Maybe we could look at that to be more similar to the falling of the Berlin Wall  where a divide that had kept two types of people apart had collapsed and opened up a door for further communication. So I think that  in this way  it's always possible for us to derive something positive that can help us understand one another better. TD  So  with regard to the development that we've been talking about here at this conference  I really feel that the development that we make shouldn't create a further burden for us as human beings  but should be used to improve our fundamental lifestyle of how we live in the world. TD  Of course  I rejoice in the development and the growth and the rise of the noble land of India  the great country of India  but at the same time  I think  as some of us have acknowledged  we need to be aware that some aspects of this rise are coming at the cost of the very ground on which we stand. So  as we are climbing the tree  some of the things that we're doing in order to climb the tree are actually undermining the tree's very root. And so  what I think it comes down to is a question of  not only having information of what's going on  but paying attention to that and letting that shift our motivation to become more sincere and genuinely positive. We have hear  this week  about the horrible sufferings  for example  that so many women of the world are enduring day to day. We have that information  but what often happens to us is that we don't really choose to pay attention to it. We don't really choose to allow that to cause there to be a shift in our hearts. So I think the way forward for the world    one that will bring the path of outer development in harmony with the real root of happiness    is that we allow the information that we have to really make a change in our heart. TD  So I think that sincere motivation is very important for our future well being  or deep sense of well being as humans  and I think that means sinking in to whatever it is you're doing now. Whatever work you're trying to do now to benefit the world  sink into that  get a full taste of that. TD  So  since we've been here this week  we've taken millions of breaths  collectively  and perhaps we haven't witnessed any course changes happening in our lives  but we often miss the very subtle changes. And I think that sometimes we develop grand concepts of what happiness might look like for us  but that  if we pay attention  we can see that there are little symbols of happiness in every breath that we take. TD  So  every one of you who has come here is so talented  and you have so much to offer to the world  I think it would be a good note to conclude on then to just take a moment to appreciate how fortunate we are to have come together in this way and exchanged ideas and really form a strong aspiration and energy within ourselves that we will take the good that has come from this conference  the momentum  the positivity  and we will spread that and plant it in all of the corners of the world. His Holiness the Karmapa  Tomorrow is my Talk. TD  Lakshmi has worked incredibly hard  even in inviting me  let alone everything else that she has done to make this happen  and I was somewhat resistant at times  and I was also very nervous throughout this week. I was feeling under the weather and dizzy and so forth  and people would ask me  why. I would tell them   It's because I have to talk tomorrow.  And so Lakshmi had to put up with me through all of that  but I very much appreciate the opportunity she's given me to be here. And to you  everyone  thank you very much. HH  Thank you very much. Everyone  please think of your biggest personal goal. For real    you can take a second. You've got to feel this to learn it. Take a few seconds and think of your personal biggest goal  okay  Imagine deciding right now that you're going to do it. Imagine telling someone that you meet today what you're going to do. Imagine their congratulations  and their high image of you. Doesn't it feel good to say it out loud  Don't you feel one step closer already  like it's already becoming part of your identity  Well  bad news  you should have kept your mouth shut  because that good feeling now will make you less likely to do it. The repeated psychology tests have proven that telling someone your goal makes it less likely to happen. Any time you have a goal  there are some steps that need to be done  some work that needs to be done in order to achieve it. Ideally you would not be satisfied until you'd actually done the work. But when you tell someone your goal and they acknowledge it  psychologists have found that it's called a  social reality.  The mind is kind of tricked into feeling that it's already done. And then because you've felt that satisfaction  you're less motivated to do the actual hard work necessary. So this goes against conventional wisdom that we should tell our friends our goals  right  So they hold us to it. So  let's look at the proof.       Kurt Lewin  founder of social psychology  called this  substitution.        Wera Mahler found when it was acknowledged by others  it felt real in the mind.       Peter Gollwitzer wrote a whole book about this  and in       he did some new tests that were published. It goes like this      people across four separate tests. Everyone wrote down their personal goal. Then half of them announced their commitment to this goal to the room  and half didn't. Then everyone was given    minutes of work that would directly lead them towards their goal  but they were told that they could stop at any time. Now  those who kept their mouths shut worked the entire    minutes on average  and when asked afterward  said that they felt that they had a long way to go still to achieve their goal. But those who had announced it quit after only    minutes  on average  and when asked afterward  said that they felt much closer to achieving their goal. So if this is true  what can we do  Well  you could resist the temptation to announce your goal. You can delay the gratification that the social acknowledgment brings  and you can understand that your mind mistakes the talking for the doing. But if you do need to talk about something  you can state it in a way that gives you no satisfaction  such as   I really want to run this marathon  so I need to train five times a week and kick my ass if I don't  okay   So audience  next time you're tempted to tell someone your goal  what will you say  Exactly  Well done. This strange looking plant is called the Llareta. What looks like moss covering rocks is actually a shrub comprised of thousands of branches  each containing clusters of tiny green leaves at the end and so densely packed together that you could actually stand on top of it. This individual lives in the Atacama Desert in Chile  and it happens to be       years old. It also happens to be a relative of parsley. For the past five years  I've been researching  working with biologists and traveling all over the world to find continuously living organisms that are       years old and older. The project is part art and part science. There's an environmental component. And I'm also trying to create a means in which to step outside our quotidian experience of time and to start to consider a deeper timescale. I selected       years as my minimum age because I wanted to start at what we consider to be year zero and work backward from there. What you're looking at now is a tree called Jomon Sugi  living on the remote island of Yakushima. The tree was in part a catalyst for the project. I'd been traveling in Japan without an agenda other than to photograph  and then I heard about this tree that is       years old and knew that I had to go visit it. It wasn't until later  when I was actually back home in New York that I got the idea for the project. So it was the slow churn  if you will. I think it was my longstanding desire to bring together my interest in art  science and philosophy that allowed me to be ready when the proverbial light bulb went on. So I started researching  and to my surprise  this project had never been done before in the arts or the sciences. And    perhaps naively    I was surprised to find that there isn't even an area in the sciences that deals with this idea of global species longevity. So what you're looking at here is the rhizocarpon geographicum  or map lichen  and this is around       years old and lives in Greenland  which is a long way to go for some lichens. Visiting Greenland was more like traveling back in time than just traveling very far north. It was very primal and more remote than anything I'd ever experienced before. And this is heightened by a couple of particular experiences. One was when I had been dropped off by boat on a remote fjord  only to find that the archeologists I was supposed to meet were nowhere to be found. And it's not like you could send them a text or shoot them an e mail  so I was literally left to my own devices. But luckily  it worked out obviously  but it was a humbling experience to feel so disconnected. And then a few days later  we had the opportunity to go fishing in a glacial stream near our campsite  where the fish were so abundant that you could literally reach into the stream and grab out a foot long trout with your bare hands. It was like visiting a more innocent time on the planet. And then  of course  there's the lichens. These lichens grow only one centimeter every hundred years. I think that really puts human lifespans into a different perspective. And what you're looking at here is an aerial photo take over eastern Oregon. And if the title  Searching for Armillaria Death Rings   sounds ominous  it is. The Armillaria is actually a predatory fungus  killing certain species of trees in the forest. It's also more benignly known as the honey mushroom or the  humongous fungus  because it happens to be one of the world's largest organisms as well. So with the help of some biologists studying the fungus  I got some maps and some GPS coordinates and chartered a plane and started looking for the death rings  the circular patterns in which the fungus kills the trees. So I'm not sure if there are any in this photo  but I do know the fungus is down there. And then this back down on the ground and you can see that the fungus is actually invading this tree. So that white material that you see in between the bark and the wood is the mycelial felt of the fungus  and what it's doing    it's actually slowly strangling the tree to death by preventing the flow of water and nutrients. So this strategy has served it pretty well    it's       years old. And then from underground to underwater. This is a Brain Coral living in Tobago that's around       years old. And I had to overcome my fear of deep water to find this one. This is at about    feet or    meters  depth. And you'll see  there's some damage to the surface of the coral. That was actually caused by a school of parrot fish that had started eating it  though luckily  they lost interest before killing it. Luckily still  it seems to be out of harm's way of the recent oil spill. But that being said  we just as easily could have lost one of the oldest living things on the planet  and the full impact of that disaster is still yet to be seen. Now this is something that I think is one of the most quietly resilient things on the planet. This is clonal colony of Quaking Aspen trees  living in Utah  that is literally        years old. What looks like a forest is actually only one tree. Imagine that it's one giant root system and each tree is a stem coming up from that system. So what you have is one giant  interconnected  genetically identical individual that's been living for        years. It also happens to be male and  in theory immortal. This is a clonal tree as well. This is the spruce Gran Picea  which at       years is a mere babe in the woods. The location of this tree is actually kept secret for its own protection. I spoke to the biologist who discovered this tree  and he told me that that spindly growth you see there in the center is most likely a product of climate change. As it's gotten warmer on the top of the mountain  the vegetation zone is actually changing. So we don't even necessarily have to have direct contact with these organisms to have a very real impact on them. This is the Fortingall Yew    no  I'm just kidding    this is the Fortingall Yew. But I put that slide in there because I'm often asked if there are any animals in the project. And aside from coral  the answer is no. Does anybody know how old the oldest tortoise is    any guesses  Rachel Sussman       No      is the oldest living tortoise  so nowhere near      . And then  you might have heard of this giant clam that was discovered off the coast of northern Iceland that reached     years old. However  it died in the lab as they were determining its age. The most interesting discovery of late  I think is the so called immortal jellyfish  which has actually been observed in the lab to be able to be able to revert back to the polyp state after reaching full maturity. So that being said  it's highly unlikely that any jellyfish would survive that long in the wild. And back to the yew here. So as you can see  it's in a churchyard  it's in Scotland. It's behind a protective wall. And there are actually a number or ancient yews in churchyards around the U.K.  but if you do the math  you'll remember it's actually the yew trees that were there first  then the churches. And now down to another part of the world. I had the opportunity to travel around the Limpopo Province in South Africa with an expert in Baobab trees. And we saw a number of them  and this is most likely the oldest. It's around        and it's called the Sagole Baobab. And you know  I think of all of these organisms as palimpsests. They contain thousands of years of their own histories within themselves  and they also contain records of natural and human events. And the Baobabs in particular are a great example of this. You can see that this one has names carved into its trunk  but it also records some natural events. So the Baobabs  as they get older  tend to get pulpy in their centers and hollow out. And this can create great natural shelters for animals  but they've also been appropriated for some rather dubious human uses  including a bar  a prison and even a toilet inside of a tree. And this brings me to another favorite of mine    I think  because it is just so unusual. This plant is called the Welwitschia  and it lives only in parts of coastal Namibia and Angola  where it's uniquely adapted to collect moisture from mist coming off the sea. And what's more  it's actually a tree. It's a primitive conifer. You'll notice that it's bearing cones down the center. And what looks like two big heaps of leaves  is actually two single leaves that get shredded up by the harsh desert conditions over time. And it actually never sheds those leaves  so it also bears the distinction of having the longest leaves in the plant kingdom. I spoke to a biologist at the Kirstenbosch Botanical Garden in Capetown to ask him where he thought this remarkable plant came from  and his thought was that if you travel around Namibia  you see that there are a number of petrified forests  and the logs are all    the logs are all giant coniferous trees  and yet there's no sign of where they might have come from. So his thought was that flooding in the north of Africa actually brought those coniferous trees down tens of thousands of years ago  and what resulted was this remarkable adaptation to this unique desert environment. This is what I think is the most poetic of the oldest living things. This is something called an underground forest. So  I spoke to a botanist at the Pretoria Botanical Garden  who explained that certain species of trees have adapted to this region. It's bushfelt region  which is dry and prone to a lot of fires  as so what these trees have done is  if you can imagine that this is the crown of the tree  and that this is ground level  imagine that the whole thing  that whole bulk of the tree  migrated underground  and you just have those leaves peeping up above the surface. That way  when a fire roars through  it's the equivalent of getting your eyebrows singed. The tree can easily recover. These also tend to grow clonally  the oldest of which is        years old. Back in the U.S.  there's a couple plants of similar age. This is the clonal Creosote bush  which is around        years old. If you've been in the American West  you know the Creosote bush is pretty ubiquitous  but that being said  you see that this has this unique  circular form. And what's happening is it's expanding slowly outwards from that original shape. And it's one    again  that interconnected root system  making it one genetically identical individual. It also has a friend nearby    well  I think they're friends. This is the clonal Mojave yucca  it's about a mile away  and it's a little bit older than        years. And you see it has that similar circular form. And there's some younger clones dotting the landscape behind it. And both of these  the yucca and the Creosote bush  live on Bureau of Land Management land  and that's very different from being protected in a national park. In fact  this land is designated for recreational all terrain vehicle use. So  now I want to show what very well might be the oldest living thing on the planet. This is Siberian Actinobacteria  which is between         and         years old. This bacteria was discovered several years ago by a team of planetary biologists hoping to find clues to life on other planets by looking at one of the harshest conditions on ours. And what they found  by doing research into the permafrost  was this bacteria. But what's unique about it is that it's doing DNA repair below freezing. And what that means is that it's not dormant    it's actually been living and growing for half a million years. It's also probably one the most vulnerable of the oldest living things  because if the permafrost melts  it won't survive. This is a map that I've put together of the oldest living things  so you can get a sense of where they are  you see they're all over the world. The blue flags represent things that I've already photographed  and the reds are places that I'm still trying to get to. You'll see also  there's a flag on Antarctica. I'm trying to travel there to find       year old moss  which lives on the Antarctic Peninsula. So  I probably have about two more years left on this project    on this phase of the project  but after five years  I really feel like I know what's at the heart of this work. The oldest living things in the world are a record and celebration of our past  a call to action in the present and a barometer of our future. They've survived for millennia in desert  in the permafrost  at the tops of mountains and at the bottom of the ocean. They've withstood untold natural perils and human encroachments  but now some of them are in jeopardy  and they can't just get up and get out of the way. It's my hope that  by going to find these organisms  that I can help draw attention to their remarkable resilience and help play a part in insuring their continued longevity into the foreseeable future. Thank you. Well  that's kind of an obvious statement up there. I started with that sentence about    years ago  and I started in the context of developing countries  but you're sitting here from every corner of the world. So if you think of a map of your country  I think you'll realize that for every country on Earth  you could draw little circles to say   These are places where good teachers won't go.  On top of that  those are the places from where trouble comes. So we have an ironic problem    good teachers don't want to go to just those places where they're needed the most. I started in      to try and address this problem with an experiment  which was a very simple experiment in New Delhi. I basically embedded a computer into a wall of a slum in New Delhi. The children barely went to school  they didn't know any English    they'd never seen a computer before  and they didn't know what the internet was. I connected high speed internet to it    it's about three feet off the ground    turned it on and left it there. After this  we noticed a couple of interesting things  which you'll see. But I repeated this all over India and then through a large part of the world and noticed that children will learn to do what they want to learn to do. This is the first experiment that we did    eight year old boy on your right teaching his student  a six year old girl  and he was teaching her how to browse. This boy here in the middle of central India    this is in a Rajasthan village  where the children recorded their own music and then played it back to each other and in the process  they've enjoyed themselves thoroughly. They did all of this in four hours after seeing the computer for the first time. In another South Indian village  these boys here had assembled a video camera and were trying to take the photograph of a bumble bee. They downloaded it from Disney.com  or one of these websites     days after putting the computer in their village. So at the end of it  we concluded that groups of children can learn to use computers and the internet on their own  irrespective of who or where they were. At that point  I became a little more ambitious and decided to see what else could children do with a computer. We started off with an experiment in Hyderabad  India  where I gave a group of children    they spoke English with a very strong Telugu accent. I gave them a computer with a speech to text interface  which you now get free with Windows  and asked them to speak into it. So when they spoke into it  the computer typed out gibberish  so they said   Well  it doesn't understand anything of what we are saying.  So I said   Yeah  I'll leave it here for two months. Make yourself understood to the computer.  So the children said   How do we do that.  And I said   I don't know  actually.  And I left. Two months later    and this is now documented in the Information Technology for International Development journal    that accents had changed and were remarkably close to the neutral British accent in which I had trained the speech to text synthesizer. In other words  they were all speaking like James Tooley. So they could do that on their own. After that  I started to experiment with various other things that they might learn to do on their own. I got an interesting phone call once from Columbo  from the late Arthur C. Clarke  who said   I want to see what's going on.  And he couldn't travel  so I went over there. He said two interesting things   A teacher that can be replaced by a machine should be.  The second thing he said was that   If children have interest  then education happens.  And I was doing that in the field  so every time I would watch it and think of him. help people  because children quickly learn to navigate the web and find things which interest them. And when you've got interest  then you have education. Sugata Mitra  I took the experiment to South Africa. This is a    year old boy. like animals  and I listen to music. SM  And I asked him   Do you send emails   And he said   Yes  and they hop across the ocean.  This is in Cambodia  rural Cambodia    a fairly silly arithmetic game  which no child would play inside the classroom or at home. They would  you know  throw it back at you. They'd say   This is very boring.  If you leave it on the pavement and if all the adults go away  then they will show off with each other about what they can do. This is what these children are doing. They are trying to multiply  I think. And all over India  at the end of about two years  children were beginning to Google their homework. As a result  the teachers reported tremendous improvements in their English    rapid improvement and all sorts of things. They said   They have become really deep thinkers and so on and so forth. And indeed they had. I mean  if there's stuff on Google  why would you need to stuff it into your head  So at the end of the next four years  I decided that groups of children can navigate the internet to achieve educational objectives on their own. At that time  a large amount of money had come into Newcastle University to improve schooling in India. So Newcastle gave me a call. I said   I'll do it from Delhi.  They said   There's no way you're going to handle a million pounds worth of University money sitting in Delhi.  So in       I bought myself a heavy overcoat and moved to Newcastle. I wanted to test the limits of the system. The first experiment I did out of Newcastle was actually done in India. And I set myself and impossible target  can Tamil speaking    year old children in a South Indian village teach themselves biotechnology in English on their own  And I thought  I'll test them  they'll get a zero    I'll give the materials  I'll come back and test them    they get another zero  I'll go back and say   Yes  we need teachers for certain things.  I called in    children. They all came in there  and I told them that there's some really difficult stuff on this computer. I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't understand anything. It's all in English  and I'm going. So I left them with it. I came back after two months  and the    children marched in looking very  very quiet. I said   Well  did you look at any of the stuff   They said   Yes  we did.   Did you understand anything    No  nothing.  So I said   Well  how long did you practice on it before you decided you understood nothing   They said   We look at it every day.  So I said   For two months  you were looking at stuff you didn't understand   So a    year old girl raises her hand and says  literally   Apart from the fact that improper replication of the DNA molecule causes genetic disease  we've understood nothing else.  It took me three years to publish that. It's just been published in the British Journal of Educational Technology. One of the referees who refereed the paper said   It's too good to be true   which was not very nice. Well  one of the girls had taught herself to become the teacher. And then that's her over there. Remember  they don't study English. I edited out the last bit when I asked   Where is the neuron   and she says   The neuron  The neuron   and then she looked and did this. Whatever the expression  it was not very nice. So their scores had gone up from zero to    percent  which is an educational impossibility under the circumstances. But    percent is not a pass. So I found that they had a friend  a local accountant  a young girl  and they played football with her. I asked that girl   Would you teach them enough biotechnology to pass   And she said   How would I do that  I don't know the subject.  I said   No  use the method of the grandmother.  She said   What's that   I said   Well  what you've got to do is stand behind them and admire them all the time. Just say to them  'That's cool. That's fantastic. What is that  Can you do that again  Can you show me some more '  She did that for two months. The scores went up to     which is what the posh schools of New Delhi  with a trained biotechnology teacher were getting. So I came back to Newcastle with these results and decided that there was something happening here that definitely was getting very serious. So  having experimented in all sorts of remote places  I came to the most remote place that I could think of. Approximately       miles from Delhi is the little town of Gateshead. In Gateshead  I took    children and I started to fine tune the method. I made them into groups of four. I said   You make your own groups of four. Each group of four can use one computer and not four computers.  Remember  from the Hole in the Wall.  You can exchange groups. You can walk across to another group  if you don't like your group  etc. You can go to another group  peer over their shoulders  see what they're doing  come back to you own group and claim it as your own work.  And I explained to them that  you know  a lot of scientific research is done using that method. The children enthusiastically got after me and said   Now  what do you want us to do   I gave them six GCSE questions. The first group    the best one    solved everything in    minutes. The worst  in   . They used everything that they knew    news groups  Google  Wikipedia  Ask Jeeves  etc. The teachers said   Is this deep learning   I said   Well  let's try it. I'll come back after two months. We'll give them a paper test    no computers  no talking to each other  etc.  The average score when I'd done it with the computers and the groups was    percent. When I did the experiment  when I did the test  after two months  the score was    percent. There was photographic recall inside the children  I suspect because they're discussing with each other. A single child in front of a single computer will not do that. I have further results  which are almost unbelievable  of scores which go up with time. Because their teachers say that after the session is over  the children continue to Google further. Here in Britain  I put out a call for British grandmothers  after my Kuppam experiment. Well  you know  they're very vigorous people  British grandmothers.     of them volunteered immediately. The deal was that they would give me one hour of broadband time  sitting in their homes  one day in a week. So they did that  and over the last two years  over     hours of instruction has happened over Skype  using what my students call the granny cloud. The granny cloud sits over there. I can beam them to whichever school I want to. You say it. You can't catch me. Children  You can't catch me. Teacher  I'm the gingerbread man. Children  I'm the gingerbread man. Teacher  Well done. Very good ... SM  Back at Gateshead  a    year old girl gets into the heart of Hinduism in    minutes. You know  stuff which I don't know anything about. Two children watch a TEDTalk. They wanted to be footballers before. After watching eight TEDTalks  he wants to become Leonardo da Vinci. It's pretty simple stuff. This is what I'm building now    they're called SOLEs  Self Organized Learning Environments. The furniture is designed so that children can sit in front of big  powerful screens  big broadband connections  but in groups. If they want  they can call the granny cloud. This is a SOLE in Newcastle. The mediator is from Pune  India. So how far can we go  One last little bit and I'll stop. I went to Turin in May. I sent all the teachers away from my group of    year old students. I speak only English  they speak only Italian  so we had no way to communicate. I started writing English questions on the blackboard. The children looked at it and said   What   I said   Well  do it.  They typed it into Google  translated it into Italian  went back into Italian Google. Fifteen minutes later    next question  where is Calcutta  This one  they took only    minutes. I tried a really hard one then. Who was Pythagoras  and what did he do  There was silence for a while  then they said   You've spelled it wrong. It's Pitagora.  And then  in    minutes  the right angled triangles began to appear on the screens. This sent shivers up my spine. These are    year olds. Text  In another    minutes they would reach the Theory of Relativity. And then  SM  So you know what's happened  I think we've just stumbled across a self organizing system. A self organizing system is one where a structure appears without explicit intervention from the outside. Self organizing systems also always show emergence  which is that the system starts to do things  which it was never designed for. Which is why you react the way you do  because it looks impossible. I think I can make a guess now    education is self organizing system  where learning is an emergent phenomenon. It'll take a few years to prove it  experimentally  but I'm going to try. But in the meanwhile  there is a method available. One billion children  we need     million mediators    there are many more than that on the planet       million SOLEs      billion dollars and    years. We could change everything. Thanks. The moment I say  school   so many memories come back to me. It's like after every exam  when I walk out  the teacher would say   Hey  come. How did you do   I would say with a great smile   I will definitely pass.  And I didn't understand why  in one hand they say   Speak the truth   in the other hand  when you say the truth  they hated you. So it went on like that  and I didn't know where else to find myself. So I remember those nights I used to go to sleep with asking help from  the  Unknown because  for some reason  I couldn't believe what my father and mother hanged in the Puja room as a god  because my friend's family had something else as a god. So I thought   I guess I'll pray to  the  Unknown and ask help   and started getting help from everywhere  each and every corner of my life at that time. My brothers started giving me a few tips about drawing and painting. Then  when I was in eighth standard around    years old  I started working in a part time job in one of the signboard artists called Putu. And then school also started supporting me.  Oh  he's bad at studies  but let him send to the drawing competitions.  So it was good to survive with that little tool that I found to find my own place in school. And one of those competitions  I just won a small  little transistor Philips radio. And I didn't have the patience to wait until I reached home. So I just switched on in the train  loudly. If you travel in Indian trains  you can see people listening to radio and  you know  even from their mobiles. So at that time    and I was       and I was listening to just radio  and someone happened to sit next to me  like these three people are sitting here. You know  like just adjacent to me. He just started asking   Where did you buy the radio  How much is it   I said   It's a prize from  an  art competition.  And he said   Oh  I teach at a college of arts. I think you should study in a school of art. You just quit school and come there.  So  why I'm telling you this  you know  maybe  you know  whoever is sitting next to you can change your whole life    it's possible. It is that we need we need to be open and fine tuned. So that's what made me enter  the  college of arts after three attempts and just continue to inquire what I really want to do with art work  or art and finally I'm here in front of you. When I look back  you know  on what happened between that time and now here    the last       years    I can see that most of the works revolve around three subjects  but it was not intentional. And I just start out with a trace because I was thinking   What really makes us      you know  it's actually  the  past  what makes a person. So I was thinking  but when you look at the past  the way to understand the past is only by the traces available  because we cannot go back  to  the past. It can be ruins  or it can be music  or it can be painting or drawing or writing  whatever it is. But it is just a kind of trace of that time. And that fascinated me  to explore that territory. So I was working on the line  but instead of working about traces  I started capturing traces. So here are some of the works I would like to show you. So this is called  Self In Progress.  It's just a trace of being in this body. So here  what happened then  you know    what I really enjoyed the most is that this sculpture is nothing but a trace of myself. It's almost like a  D photograph. So there is an element of performance  and there is an element of sculpture  and there is an element of feeling one's self  so close to one's self. So it's almost like fossils for the future. And then moved slowly to explore the other possibilities of capturing traces. So this is what I was talking about  while molding  it's such a great experience  because we have freedom of like walking  or moving my hand or  moving around in the space  but the moment this becomes solid  when you cannot move even an inch  because this is plaster of Paris  so the moment you pour it it's like liquid  but after    minutes  it's almost like a hard stone. So this is capturing the trace of a thumbprint because  knowingly or unknowingly  whatever we do  you know  we leave our traces here. So I just thought   I'm going to capture thumbprint  footprint  or whatever traces we leave as humans.  This is the trace of fire  this is the trace of sun. Because when I was capturing traces  you know  this thought comes to me always  is it  only when the object touches the thing and it leaves the trace  or is there other ways to capture it   So this work is nothing but like    because of the focal length of the lens  it just shows what is on the other side. So I just put the paper on the focal length  which was an etching print  then I got the portrait of  the  sun from sunlight. This is called  Dawn to Dawn.  What I did here  I just put like    feet  of  paper then put a coconut rope  and just burnt it. So it took about    hours to get this line. So wherever the fire is eating the paper  that's what becomes the work    detail. Even though we have traces when we try to understand them  the perception and context play a major role to understand it. So do we really understand what it is  or are we trying to get what we think it is  Then move towards questioning the perception because  even though there are traces  when you try to understand them  you know you play a major role. So like let's say even a simple act. How many of you saw a cow crossing in India while you were coming from Bangalore to Mysore  Can you just raise the hand  If you just ask an opinion of how  everyone can interpret it. Like  let's say  if a schoolteacher says  she'll simply say   To get to the other side.  Why the cow was crossing the road  you know. The answer can be so different if Potter said it. He would say   For the greater good.  Martin Luther King would say   I imagine a world where all cows will be free to cross the road  without having their motives called into question.  Imagine Moses comes now  and he sees the same cow walking around the street. He would definitely say   God came down from heaven  and he said unto the cow  'Thou shalt cross the road.' And cow crossed the road  and there was much rejoicing as a holy cow.  Freud would say   The fact that you're at all concerned reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.  If we ask Einstein  he would say   Whether the cow crossed the road  or the road moved underneath the cow  depends on your frame of reference.  Or Buddha    if he saw the same cow  he would say   Asking this question denies your own nature  as a  cow.  So  what we see is just what we think often  and most of the time  we don't see what it is. It just all depends on one's perception. And context  what is really context  You know  I could just show you this little piece of paper. Because I always think meaning doesn't really exist. The meaning of what we create in this world doesn't exist. It's just created by the mind. If you look at this piece of paper  this is the breadth and this is called length. This is how we've been taught in school. But if you tear it in the middle    now  I didn't touch this breadth  but still  the meaning of this changes. So what we conceive as a meaning is always not there  it's on the other side  even when we say dark  light  good  bad  tall  short    all meaning it doesn't exist in reality. It's just that being a human  the way we train to perceive the reality creates this meaning. So this work from this period is mostly like    you know  this is a work called  Light Makes Dark.  It's just captured through from the lamp. So the lamp is not just giving a light  it's also giving a darkness. So this is a work of art  which is just trying to explore that. This is called  Limit Out.  This shows how limited our eye or hearing sense or touch    do we really see  This is an exact negative. It's about six inches deep in the wall  but it just appears like it's coming out of the wall. You know the wall is almost like    this is the first skin  and this is the second  and there's a third  and each creates a meaning. And we're just pulling the wall off the gallery. Again   Inward Out.  It's a full figure cast from myself. It's about eight inches deep. When I was doing that  I always wondered since I've worked with creators    and now you know  I've moved to questioning the perception    whenever I see the bird flying in the sky  it just makes me feel like  is there anything behind  are there any traces up there  which as a human  we don't see them  Is there any way to capture the thought into visual art  I couldn't find it. But a solution arrived after being quiet and not working for about six  seven months  in the restroom  when I was changing the air freshener that goes from solid substance to vapor. It's called Odonil. This is the work I made out of that material. The process to get to make the sculpture was interesting  because I wrote to Balsara  who produces that air freshener called Odonil  saying   Dear Sir  I am an artist. This is my catalogue. Will you help me to make this sculpture   They never wrote back to me. Then I thought   I will go to the Small Scale Industries Facilitating Unit and ask help.  So I told them   I'd like to start an air freshener company.  They said   Of course. This is the fee for the project report  and we will give you all the details   and they gave. Finally  I went back to them and said   It's not for starting the company  it's just to make my own work. Please come for the show.  And they did. And this work is in the Devi Art Foundation in Delhi. In India  nobody really talks about works of art  they always talk about the appreciation of art. You buy this for       rupees  it'll become        in two months. This is the craft that was going on  but there are a few collectors who also collect art which can depreciate. And this was collected by Anupam    which is like  finally in the end  he will not have anything  because it will evaporate. So this is after a few weeks  this is after a few months. It's just all about questioning the preconceptions. So if someone says   Oh  I see the portrait   it may not be the portrait after a few months. And if they say it's solid  it will not be solid  it will evaporate. And if they say they don't get it  that's also not true  because it's in the air. It's in the same gallery or in the same museum. So they inhaled it  but they are not aware of it. While I was doing that work  my mom and my dad  they were looking at it and they said   Why do you deal with negative subjects all the time   And I was like   What do you mean    Light makes dark and now evaporating self. Don't you think it remained something about death   they said.  Of course not. For me   I'm thinking   this is tucked in some small solid  but the moment it evaporates  it's merged with the whole.  But she said   No. Still  I don't like it. Can you make something from nothing as a sculptor   I said   No  mom. It can't be. Because we can create a sculpture by gathering dust together  or we can break the sculpture and get the dust  but there is nowhere that we can bring dust into the universe.  So  I did this work for her. It's called  Emerging Angel.  This is the first day    it just gives the appearance that one is becoming the other. So  the same sculpture after a few days. This is after       days. Through that small little slit between the glass box and the wood  the air goes underneath the sculpture and creates the other one. This gave me a greater faith. That evaporating sculpture gave me a greater faith that maybe there is many more possibilities to capture  the  invisible. So what you see now is called  Shadow Foreshadow.  And what I'd like to tell you is we don't see shadow  and we don't see light too  we see the source of the light. We see where it's bouncing  but we don't see  them  as they exist. You know  that's why the night sky  we see the sky as dark  but it's filled with light all the time. When it's bounced on the moon  we see it. The same thing in the darkroom. The little dust particle will again  reflect the light  and we realize the existence of light. So we don't see dark  we don't see light  we don't see gravity  we don't see electricity. So  I just started doing this work to inquire further about how to sculpt the space between this object and there. Because  as a visual artist  if I'm seeing this and I'm seeing that    but how to sculpt this  you know  If we sculpt this  this has two reference points. The skin of this is also representing this. And skin at the other end also represents the floor. I did this as an experiment of casting the shadow. So this is a corrugated box and its shadow. Then the second one    the moment you bring any invisible into the visible world it will have all the characteristics of the visible existence. So that produced a shadow. Then I thought  okay  let me sculpt that. Then  again  that becomes an object. Again  throwing light  then the third one. So what you see is nothing but shadow of a shadow of a shadow. And then again  at that point  there is no shadow. I thought   Oh  good. Work is finished.  You can see the detail. This is called  Gravity.  It's called  Breath.  It's just two holes on the gallery wall. It's a false wall  which contains like     cubic feet. So that hole actually makes the air come out and go in. So where it's happening  we can see  but what is happening will remain invisible only. This is from the show called  Invisible   at Talwar Gallery. This is called  Kaayam.  Detail. And what I'd like to tell you  our senses are so limited    we cannot hear everything  we cannot see everything. We don't feel   I am touching the air   but if the breeze is a little more faster  then I can feel it. So all of our construction of reality is through these limited senses. So my request was like  is there any way to use all this as just a symbol or a sign  And to really get to the point  we should move beyond  you know  go to the other side of the wall  like illogic  like are invisible. Because when we see someone walks  we see the footprint. But if we're just cutting that footprint from the whole thing and trying to analyze it  you will miss the point because the actual journey happens between those footprints  and the footprints are nothing but passing time. Thank you. My story is a little bit about war. It's about disillusionment. It's about death. And it's about rediscovering idealism in all of that wreckage. And perhaps also  there's a lesson about how to deal with our screwed up  fragmenting and dangerous world of the   st century. I don't believe in straightforward narratives. I don't believe in a life or history written as decision  A  led to consequence  B  led to consequence  C     these neat narratives that we're presented with  and that perhaps we encourage in each other. I believe in randomness  and one of the reasons I believe that is because me becoming a diplomat was random. I'm colorblind. I was born unable to see most colors. This is why I wear gray and black most of the time  and I have to take my wife with me to chose clothes. And I'd always wanted to be a fighter pilot when I was a boy. I loved watching planes barrel over our holiday home in the countryside. And it was my boyhood dream to be a fighter pilot. And I did the tests in the Royal Air Force to become a pilot  and sure enough  I failed. I couldn't see all the blinking different lights  and I can't distinguish color. So I had to choose another career  and this was in fact relatively easy for me  because I had an abiding passion all the way through my childhood  which was international relations. As a child  I read the newspaper thoroughly. I was fascinated by the Cold War  by the INF negotiations over intermediate range nuclear missiles  the proxy war between the Soviet Union and the U.S. in Angola or Afghanistan. These things really interested me. And so I decided quite at an early age I wanted to be a diplomat. And I  one day  I announced this to my parents    and my father denies this story to this day    I said   Daddy  I want to be a diplomat.  And he turned to me  and he said   Carne  you have to be very clever to be a diplomat.  And my ambition was sealed. In       I entered the British Foreign Service. That year        people applied to become a diplomat  and    of us succeeded. And as those numbers suggest  I was inducted into an elite and fascinating and exhilarating world. Being a diplomat  then and now  is an incredible job  and I loved every minute of it    I enjoyed the status of it. I bought myself a nice suit and wore leather soled shoes and reveled in this amazing access I had to world events. I traveled to the Gaza Strip. I headed the Middle East Peace Process section in the British Foreign Ministry. I became a speechwriter for the British Foreign Secretary. I met Yasser Arafat. I negotiated with Saddam's diplomats at the U.N. Later  I traveled to Kabul and served in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban. And I would travel in a C     transport and go and visit warlords in mountain hideaways and negotiate with them about how we were going to eradicate Al Qaeda from Afghanistan  surrounded by my Special Forces escort  who  themselves  had to have an escort of a platoon of Royal Marines  because it was so dangerous. And that was exciting    that was fun. It was really interesting. And it's a great cadre of people  incredibly close knit community of people. And the pinnacle of my career  as it turned out  was when I was posted to New York. I'd already served in Germany  Norway  various other places  but I was posted to New York to serve on the U.N. Security Council for the British delegation. And my responsibility was the Middle East  which was my specialty. And there  I dealt with things like the Middle East peace process  the Lockerbie issue    we can talk about that later  if you wish    but above all  my responsibility was Iraq and its weapons of mass destruction and the sanctions we placed on Iraq to oblige it to disarm itself of these weapons. I was the chief British negotiator on the subject  and I was steeped in the issue. And anyway  my tour    it was kind of a very exciting time. I mean it was very dramatic diplomacy. We went through several wars during my time in New York. I negotiated for my country the resolution in the Security Council of the   th of September      condemning the attacks of the day before  which were  of course  deeply present to us actually living in New York at the time. So it was kind of the best of time  worst of times kind of experience. I lived the high life. Although I worked very long hours  I lived in a penthouse in Union Square. I was a single British diplomat in New York City  you can imagine what that might have meant. I had a good time. But in       when my tour came to an end  I decided I wasn't going to go back to the job that was waiting for me in London. I decided to take a sabbatical  in fact  at the New School  Bruce. In some inchoate  inarticulate way I realized that there was something wrong with my work  with me. I was exhausted  and I was also disillusioned in a way I couldn't quite put my finger on. And I decided to take some time out from work. The Foreign Office was very generous. You could take these special unpaid leave  as they called them  and yet remain part of the diplomatic service  but not actually do any work. It was nice. And eventually  I decided to take a secondment to join the U.N. in Kosovo  which was then under U.N. administration. And two things happened in Kosovo  which kind of  again  shows the randomness of life  because these things turned out to be two of the pivots of my life and helped to deliver me to the next stage. But they were random things. One was that  in the summer of       the British government  somewhat reluctantly  decided to have an official inquiry into the use of intelligence on WMD in the run up to the Iraq War  a very limited subject. And I testified to that inquiry in secret. I had been steeped in the intelligence on Iraq and its WMD  and my testimony to the inquiry said three things  that the government exaggerated the intelligence  which was very clear in all the years I'd read it. And indeed  our own internal assessment was very clear that Iraq's WMD did not pose a threat to its neighbors  let alone to us. Secondly  the government had ignored all available alternatives to war  which in some ways was a more discreditable thing still. The third reason  I won't go into. But anyway  I gave that testimony  and that presented me with a crisis. What was I going to do  This testimony was deeply critical of my colleagues  of my ministers  who had  in my view had perpetrated a war on a falsehood. And so I was in crisis. And this wasn't a pretty thing. I moaned about it  I hesitated  I went on and on and on to my long suffering wife  and eventually I decided to resign from the British Foreign Service. I felt    there's a scene in the Al Pacino movie  The Insider   which you may know  where he goes back to CBS after they've let him down over the tobacco guy  and he goes   You know  I just can't do this anymore. Something's broken.  And it was like that for me. I love that movie. I felt just something's broken. I can't actually sit with my foreign minister or my prime minister again with a smile on my face and do what I used to do gladly for them. So took a running leap and jumped over the edge of a cliff. And it was a very  very uncomfortable  unpleasant feeling. And I started to fall. And today  that fall hasn't stopped  I'm still falling. But  in a way  I've got used to the sensation of it. And in a way  I kind of like the sensation of it a lot better than I like actually standing on top of the cliff  wondering what to do. A second thing happened in Kosovo  which kind of    I need a quick gulp of water  forgive me. A second thing happened in Kosovo  which kind of delivered the answer  which I couldn't really answer  which is   What do I do with my life   I love diplomacy    I have no career    I expected my entire life to be a diplomat  to be serving my country. I wanted to be an ambassador  and my mentors  my heroes  people who got to the top of my profession  and here I was throwing it all away. A lot of my friends were still in it. My pension was in it. And I gave it up. And what was I going to do  And that year  in Kosovo  this terrible  terrible thing happened  which I saw. In March       there were terrible riots all over the province    as it then was    of Kosovo.    people were killed. It was anarchy. And it's a very horrible thing to see anarchy  to know that the police and the military    there were lots of military troops there    actually can't stop that rampaging mob who's coming down the street. And the only way that rampaging mob coming down the street will stop is when they decide to stop and when they've had enough burning and killing. And that is not a very nice feeling to see  and I saw it. And I went through it. I went through those mobs. And with my Albanian friends  we tried to stop it  but we failed. And that riot taught me something  which isn't immediately obvious and it's kind of a complicated story. But one of the reasons that riot took place    those riots  which went on for several days  took place    was because the Kosovo people were disenfranchised from their own future. There were diplomatic negotiations about the future of Kosovo going on then  and the Kosovo government  let alone the Kosovo people  were not actually participating in those talks. There was this whole fancy diplomatic system  this negotiation process about the future of Kosovo  and the Kosovars weren't part of it. And funnily enough  they were frustrated about that. Those riots were part of the manifestation of that frustration. It wasn't the only reason  and life is not simple  one reason narratives. It was a complicated thing  and I'm not pretending it was more simple than it was. But that was one of the reasons. And that kind of gave me the inspiration    or rather to be precise  it gave my wife the inspiration. She said   Why don't you advise the Kosovars  Why don't you advise their government on their diplomacy   And the Kosovars were not allowed a diplomatic service. They were not allowed diplomats. They were not allowed a foreign office to help them deal with this immensely complicated process  which became known as the Final Status Process of Kosovo. And so that was the idea. That was the origin of the thing that became Independent Diplomat  the world's first diplomatic advisory group and a non profit to boot. And it began when I flew back from London after my time at the U.N. in Kosovo. I flew back and had dinner with the Kosovo prime minister and said to him   Look  I'm proposing that I come and advise you on the diplomacy. I know this stuff. It's what I do. Why don't I come and help you   And he raised his glass of raki to me and said   Yes  Carne. Come.  And I came to Kosovo and advised the Kosovo government. Independent Diplomat ended up advising three successive Kosovo prime ministers and the multi party negotiation team of Kosovo. And Kosovo became independent. Independent Diplomat is now established in five diplomatic centers around the world  and we're advising seven or eight different countries  or political groups  depending on how you wish to define them    and I'm not big on definitions. We're advising the Northern Cypriots on how to reunify their island. We're advising the Burmese opposition  the government of Southern Sudan  which    you heard it here first    is going to be a new country within the next few years. We're advising the Polisario Front of the Western Sahara  who are fighting to get their country back from Moroccan occupation after    years of dispossession. We're advising various island states in the climate change negotiations  which is suppose to culminate in Copenhagen. There's a bit of randomness here too because  when I was beginning Independent Diplomat  I went to a party in the House of Lords  which is a ridiculous place  but I was holding my drink like this  and I bumped into this guy who was standing behind me. And we started talking  and he said    I told him what I was doing  and I told him rather grandly I was going to establish Independent Diplomat in New York. At that time there was just me    and me and my wife were moving back to New York. And he said   Why don't you see my colleagues in New York   And it turned out he worked for an innovation company called  What If   which some of you have probably heard of. And one thing led to another  and I ended up having a desk in  What If  in New York  when I started Independent Diplomat. And watching  What If  develop new flavors of chewing gum for Wrigley or new flavors for Coke actually helped me innovate new strategies for the Kosovars and for the Saharawis of the Western Sahara. And I began to realize that there are different ways of doing diplomacy    that diplomacy  like business  is a business of solving problems  and yet the word innovation doesn't exist in diplomacy  it's all zero sum games and realpolitik and ancient institutions that have been there for generations and do things the same way they've always done things. And Independent Diplomat  today  tries to incorporate some of the things I learned at  What If . We all sit in one office and shout at each other across the office. We all work on little laptops and try to move desks to change the way we think. And we use naive experts who may know nothing about the countries we're dealing with  but may know something about something else to try to inject new thinking into the problems that we try to address for our clients. It's not easy  because our clients  by definition  are having a difficult time  diplomatically. There are  I don't know  some lessons from all of this  personal and political    and in a way  they're the same thing. The personal one is falling off a cliff is actually a good thing  and I recommend it. And it's a good thing to do at least once in your life just to tear everything up and jump. The second thing is a bigger lesson about the world today. Independent Diplomat is part of a trend which is emerging and evident across the world  which is that the world is fragmenting. States mean less than they used to  and the power of the state is declining. That means the power of others things is rising. Those other things are called non state actors. They may be corporations  they may be mafiosi  they may be nice NGOs  they may anything  any number of things. We are living in a more complicated and fragmented world. If governments are less able to affect the problems that affect us in the world  then that means  who is left to deal with them  who has to take greater responsibility to deal with them  Us. If they can't do it  who's left to deal with it  We have no choice but to embrace that reality. What this means is it's no longer good enough to say that international relations  or global affairs  or chaos in Somalia  or what's going on in Burma is none of your business  and that you can leave it to governments to get on with. I can connect any one of you by six degrees of separation to the Al Shabaab militia in Somalia. Ask me how later  particularly if you eat fish  interestingly enough  but that connection is there. We are all intimately connected. And this isn't just Tom Friedman  it's actually provable in case after case after case. What that means is  instead of asking your politicians to do things  you have to look to yourself to do things. And Independent Diplomat is a kind of example of this in a sort of loose way. There aren't neat examples  but one example is this  the way the world is changing is embodied in what's going on at the place I used to work    the U.N. Security Council. The U.N. was established in     . Its charter is basically designed to stop conflicts between states    interstate conflict. Today     percent of the agenda of the U.N. Security Council is about conflicts within states  involving non state parties    guerillas  separatists  terrorists  if you want to call them that  people who are not normal governments  who are not normal states. That is the state of the world today. When I realized this  and when I look back on my time at the Security Council and what happened with the Kosovars  and I realize that often the people who were most directly affected by what we were doing in the Security Council weren't actually there  weren't actually invited to give their views to the Security Council  I thought  this is wrong. Something's got to be done about this. So I started off in a traditional mode. Me and my colleagues at Independent Diplomat went around the U.N. Security Council. We went around    U.N. member states    the Kazaks  the Ethiopians  the Israelis    you name them  we went to see them    the secretary general  all of them  and said   This is all wrong. This is terrible that you don't consult these people who are actually affected. You've got to institutionalize a system where you actually invite the Kosovars to come and tell you what they think. This will allow you to tell me    you can tell them what you think. It'll be great. You can have an exchange. You can actually incorporate these people's views into your decisions  which means your decisions will be more effective and durable.  Super logical  you would think. I mean  incredibly logical. So obvious  anybody could get it. And of course  everybody got it. Everybody went   Yes  of course  you're absolutely right. Come back to us in maybe six months.  And of course  nothing happened    nobody did anything. The Security Council does its business in exactly the same way today that it did X number of years ago  when I was there    years ago. So we looked at that observation of basically failure and thought  what can we do about it. And I thought  I'm buggered if I'm going to spend the rest of my life lobbying for these crummy governments to do what needs to be done. So what we're going to do is we're actually going to set up these meetings ourselves. So now  Independent Diplomat is in the process of setting up meetings between the U.N. Security Council and the parties to the disputes that are on the agenda of the Security Council. So we will be bringing Darfuri rebel groups  the Northern Cypriots and the Southern Cypriots  rebels from Aceh  and awful long laundry list of chaotic conflicts around the world. And we will be trying to bring the parties to New York to sit down in a quiet room in a private setting with no press and actually explain what they want to the members of the U. N. Security Council  and for the members of the U.N. Security Council to explain to them what they want. So there's actually a conversation  which has never before happened. And of course  describing all this  any of you who know politics will think this is incredibly difficult  and I entirely agree with you. The chances of failure are very high  but it certainly won't happen if we don't try to make it happen. And my politics has changed fundamentally from when I was a diplomat to what I am today  and I think that outputs is what matters  not process  not technology  frankly  so much either. Preach technology to all the Twittering members of all the Iranian demonstrations who are now in political prison in Tehran  where Ahmadinejad remains in power. Technology has not delivered political change in Iran. You've got to look at the outputs  and you got to say to yourself   What can I do to produce that particular output   That is the politics of the   st century  and in a way  Independent Diplomat embodies that fragmentation  that change  that is happening to all of us. That's my story. Thanks. I am a cultural omnivore  one whose daily commute is made possible by attachment to an iPod    an iPod that contains Wagner and Mozart  pop diva Christina Aguilera  country singer Josh Turner  gangsta rap artist Kirk Franklin  concerti  symphonies and more and more. I'm a voracious reader  a reader who deals with Ian McEwan down to Stephanie Meyer. I have read the  Twilight  tetralogy. And one who lives for my home theater  a home theater where I devour DVDs  video on demand and a lot of television. For me   Law and Order  SVU   Tine Fey and     Rock  and  Judge Judy      The people are real  the cases are real  the rulings are final.  Now  I'm convinced a lot of you probably share my passions  especially my passion for Judge Judy  and you'd fight anybody who attempted to take her away from us  but I'm a little less convinced that you share the central passion of my life  a passion for the live professional performing arts  performing arts that represent the orchestral repertoire  yes  but jazz as well  modern dance  opera  theater and more and more and more. You know  frankly it's a sector that many of us who work in the field worry is being endangered and possibly dismantled by technology. While we initially heralded the Internet as the fantastic new marketing device that was going to solve all our problems  we now realize that the Internet is  if anything  too effective in that regard. Depending on who you read  an arts organization or an artist  who tries to attract the attention of a potential single ticket buyer  now competes with between three and       different marketing messages a typical citizen sees every single day. We now know in fact that technology is our biggest competitor for leisure time. Five years ago  Gen X'ers spent   .  hours online and TV  the majority on TV. Gen Y'ers spent even more      .  hours  the majority online. And now  a typical university entering student arrives at college already having spent        hours online and an additional        hours playing video games    a stark reminder that we operate in a cultural context where video games now outsell music and movie recordings combined. Moreover  we're afraid that technology has altered our very assumptions of cultural consumption. Thanks to the Internet  we believe we can get anything we want whenever we want it  delivered to our own doorstep. We can shop at three in the morning or eight at night  ordering jeans tailor made for our unique body types. Expectations of personalization and customization that the live performing arts    which have set curtain times  set venues  attendant inconveniences of travel  parking and the like    simply cannot meet. And we're all acutely aware  what's it going to mean in the future when we ask someone to pay a hundred dollars for a symphony  opera or ballet ticket  when that cultural consumer is used to downloading on the internet    hours a day for    cents a song or for free  These are enormous questions for those of us who work in this terrain. But as particular as they feel to us  we know we're not alone. All of us are engaged in a seismic  fundamental realignment of culture and communications  a realignment that is shaking and decimating the newspaper industry  the magazine industry  the book and publishing industry and more. Saddled in the performing arts as we are  by antiquated union agreements that inhibit and often prohibit mechanical reproduction and streaming  locked into large facilities that were designed to ossify the ideal relationship between artist and audience most appropriate to the   th century and locked into a business model dependent on high ticket revenues  where we charge exorbitant prices. Many of us shudder in the wake of the collapse of Tower Records and ask ourselves   Are we next   Everyone I talk to in performing arts resonates to the words of Adrienne Rich  who  in  Dreams of a Common Language   wrote   We are out in a country that has no language  no laws. Whatever we do together is pure invention. The maps they gave us are out of date by years.  And for those of you who love the arts  aren't you glad you invited me here to brighten your day  Now  rather than saying that we're on the brink of our own annihilation  I prefer to believe that we are engaged in a fundamental reformation  a reformation like the religious Reformation of the   th century. The arts reformation  like the religious Reformation  is spurred in part by technology  with indeed  the printing press really leading the charge on the religious Reformation. Both reformations were predicated on fractious discussion  internal self doubt and massive realignment of antiquated business models. And at heart  both reformations  I think were asking the questions  who's entitled to practice  How are they entitled to practice  And indeed  do we need anyone to intermediate for us in order to have an experience with a spiritual divine  Chris Anderson  someone I trust you all know  editor in chief of Wired magazine and author of  The Long Tail   really was the first    for me    to nail a lot of this. He wrote a long time ago  you know  thanks to the invention of the Internet  web technology  mini cams and more  the means of artistic production have been democratized for the first time in all of human history. In the     s  if any of you wanted to make a movie  you had to work for Warner Brothers or RKO because who could afford a movie set and lighting equipment and editing equipment and scoring and more  And now who in this room doesn't know a    year old hard at work on her second  third  or fourth movie  Similarly  the means of artistic distribution have been democratized for the first time in human history. Again  in the '  s  Warner Brothers  RKO did that for you. Now  go to YouTube  Facebook  you have worldwide distribution without leaving the privacy of your own bedroom. This double impact is occasioning a massive redefinition of the cultural market  a time when anyone is a potential author. Frankly  what we're seeing now in this environment is a massive time  when the entire world is changing as we move from a time when audience numbers are plummeting. But the number of arts participants  people who write poetry  who sing songs  who perform in church choirs  is exploding beyond our wildest imaginations. This group  others have called the  pro ams   amateur artists doing work at a professional level. You see them on YouTube  in dance competitions  film festivals and more. They are radically expanding our notions of the potential of an aesthetic vocabulary  while they are challenging and undermining the cultural autonomy of our traditional institutions. Ultimately  we now live in a world defined not by consumption  but by participation. But I want to be clear  just as the religious Reformation did not spell the end to the formal Church or to the priesthood  I believe that our artistic institutions will continue to have importance. They currently are the best opportunities for artists to have lives of economic dignity    not opulence    of dignity. And they are the places where artists who deserve and want to work at a certain scale of resources will find a home. But to view them as synonymous with the entirety of the arts community is  by far  too short sighted. And indeed  while we've tended to polarize the amateur from the professional  the single most exciting development in the last five to    years has been the rise of the professional hybrid artist  the professional artist who works  not primarily in the concert hall or on the stage  but most frequently around women's rights  or human rights  or on global warming issues or AIDS relief for more    not out of economic necessity  but out of a deep  organic conviction that the work that she or he  is called to do cannot be accomplished in the traditional hermetic arts environment. Today's dance world is not defined solely by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet or the National Ballet of Canada  but by Liz Lerman's Dance Exchange    a multi generational  professional dance company  whose dancers range in age from    to     and who work with genomic scientists to embody the DNA strand and with nuclear physicists at CERN. Today's professional theater community is defined  not only the Shaw and Stratford Festivals  but by the Cornerstone Theater of Los Angeles    a collective of artists that after       brought together    different religious communities    the Bahia  the Catholic  the Muslim  the Jewish  even the Native American and the gay and lesbian communities of faith  helping them create their own individual plays and one massive play  where they explored the differences in their faith and found commonality as an important first step toward cross community healing. Today's performers  like Rhodessa Jones  work in women's prisons  helping women prisoners articulate the pain of incarceration  while today's playwrights and directors work with youth gangs to find alternate channels to violence and more and more and more. And indeed  I think  rather than being annihilated  the performing arts are posed on the brink of a time when we will be more important than we have ever been. You know  we've said for a long time  we are critical to the health of the economic communities in your town. And absolutely    I hope you know that every dollar spent on a performing arts ticket in a community generates five to seven additional dollars for the local economy  dollars spent in restaurants or on parking  at the fabric stores where we buy fabric for costumes  the piano tuner who tunes the instruments and more. But the arts are going to be more important to economies as we go forward  especially in industries we can't even imagine yet  just as they have been central to the iPod and the computer game industries  which few  if any of us come have foreseen    to    years ago. Business leadership will depend more and more on emotional intelligence  the ability to listen deeply  to have empathy  to articulate change  to motivate others    the very capacities that the arts cultivate with every encounter. Especially now  as we all must confront the fallacy of a market only orientation  uninformed by social conscience  we must seize and celebrate the power of the arts to shape our individual and national characters  and especially characters of the young people  who all too often  are subjected to bombardment of sensation  rather than digested experience. Ultimately  especially now in this world  where we live in a context of regressive and onerous immigration laws  in reality TV that thrives on humiliation  and in a context of analysis  where the thing we hear most repeatedly  day in  day out in the United States  in every train station  every bus station  every plane station is   Ladies and gentlemen  please report any suspicious behavior or suspicious individuals to the authorities nearest you   when all of these ways we are encouraged to view our fellow human being with hostility and fear and contempt and suspicion. The arts  whatever they do  whenever they call us together  invite us to look at our fellow human being with generosity and curiosity. God knows  if we ever needed that capacity in human history  we need it now. You know  we're bound together  not  I think by technology  entertainment and design  but by common cause. We work to promote healthy vibrant societies  to ameliorate human suffering  to promote a more thoughtful  substantive  empathic world order. I salute all of you as activists in that quest and urge you to embrace and hold dear the arts in your work  whatever your purpose may be. I promise you the hand of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation is stretched out in friendship for now and years to come. And I thank you for your kindness and your patience in listening to me this afternoon. Thank you  and godspeed. If you really want to understand the problem that we're facing with the oceans  you have to think about the biology at the same time you think about the physics. We can't solve the problems unless we start studying the ocean in a very much more interdisciplinary way. So I'm going to demonstrate that through discussion of some of the climate change things that are going on in the ocean. We'll look at sea level rise. We'll look at ocean warming. And then the last thing on the list there  ocean acidification    if you were to ask me  you know   What do you worry about the most  What frightens you   for me  it's ocean acidification. And this has come onto the stage pretty recently. So I will spend a little time at the end. I was in Copenhagen in December like a number of you in this room. And I think we all found it  simultaneously  an eye opening and a very frustrating experience. I sat in this large negotiation hall  at one point  for three or four hours  without hearing the word  oceans  one time. It really wasn't on the radar screen. The nations that brought it up when we had the speeches of the national leaders    it tended to be the leaders of the small island states  the low lying island states. And by this weird quirk of alphabetical order of the nations  a lot of the low lying states  like Kiribati and Nauru  they were seated at the very end of these immensely long rows. You know  they were marginalized in the negotiation room. One of the problems is coming up with the right target. It's not clear what the target should be. And how can you figure out how to fix something if you don't have a clear target  Now  you've heard about  two degrees   that we should limit temperature rise to no more than two degrees. But there's not a lot of science behind that number. We've also talked about concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Should it be      Should it be      There's not a lot of science behind that one either. Most of the science that is behind these numbers  these potential targets  is based on studies on land. And I would say  for the people that work in the ocean and think about what the targets should be  we would argue that they must be much lower. You know  from an oceanic perspective      is way too high. Now there's compelling evidence that it really needs to be    . We are  right now  at     parts per million of CO  in the atmosphere. We're not going to put the brakes on in time to stop at      so we've got to accept we're going to do an overshoot  and the discussion as we go forward has to focus on how far the overshoot goes and what's the pathway back to    . Now  why is this so complicated  Why don't we know some of these things a little bit better  Well  the problem is that we've got very complicated forces in the climate system. There's all kinds of natural causes of climate change. There's air sea interactions. Here in Galapagos  we're affected by El Ninos and La Nina. But the entire planet warms up when there's a big El Nino. Volcanoes eject aerosols into the atmosphere. That changes our climate. The ocean contains most of the exchangeable heat on the planet. So anything that influences how ocean surface waters mix with the deep water changes the ocean of the planet. And we know the solar output's not constant through time. So those are all natural causes of climate change. And then we have the human induced causes of climate change as well. We're changing the characteristics of the surface of the land  the reflectivity. We inject our own aerosols into the atmosphere  and we have trace gases  and not just carbon dioxide    it's methane  ozone  oxides of sulfur and nitrogen. So here's the thing. It sounds like a simple question. Is CO  produced by man's activities causing the planet to warm up  But to answer that question  to make a clear attribution to carbon dioxide  you have to know something about all of these other agents of change. But the fact is we do know a lot about all of those things. You know  thousands of scientists have been working on understanding all of these man made causes and the natural causes. And we've got it worked out  and we can say   Yes  CO  is causing the planet to warm up now.  Now  we have many ways to study natural variability. I'll show you a few examples of this now. This is the ship that I spent the last three months on in the Antarctic. It's a scientific drilling vessel. We go out for months at a time and drill into the sea bed to recover sediments that tell us stories of climate change  right. Like one of the ways to understand our greenhouse future is to drill down in time to the last period where we had CO  double what it is today. And so that's what we've done with this ship. This was    this is south of the Antarctic Circle. It looks downright tropical there. One day where we had calm seas and sun  which was the reason I could get off the ship. Most of the time it looked like this. We had a waves up to    ft. and winds averaging about    knots for most of the voyage and up to    or    knots. So that trip just ended  and I can't show you too many results from that right now  but we'll go back one more year  to another drilling expedition I've been involved in. This was led by Ross Powell and Tim Naish. It's the ANDRILL project. And we made the very first bore hole through the largest floating ice shelf on the planet. This is a crazy thing  this big drill rig wrapped in a blanket to keep everybody warm  drilling at temperatures of minus   . And we drilled in the Ross Sea. That's the Ross Sea Ice Shelf on the right there. So  this huge floating ice shelf the size of Alaska comes from West Antarctica. Now  West Antarctica is the part of the continent where the ice is grounded on sea floor as much as       meters deep. So that ice sheet is partly floating  and it's exposed to the ocean  to the ocean heat. This is the part of Antarctica that we worry about. Because it's partly floating  you can imagine  is sea level rises a little bit  the ice lifts off the bed  and then it can break off and float north. When that ice melts  sea level rises by six meters. So we drill back in time to see how often that's happened  and exactly how fast that ice can melt. Here's the cartoon on the left there. We drilled through a hundred meters of floating ice shelf then through     meters of water and then       meters into the sea floor. So it's the deepest geological bore hole ever drilled. It took about    years to put this project together. And here's what we found. Now  there's    scientists working on this project  and people are doing all kinds of really complicated and expensive analyses. But it turns out  you know  the thing that told the best story was this simple visual description. You know  we saw this in the core samples as they came up. We saw these alternations between sediments that look like this    there's gravel and cobbles in there and a bunch of sand. That's the kind of material in the deep sea. It can only get there if it's carried out by ice. So we know there's an ice shelf overhead. And that alternates with a sediment that looks like this. This is absolutely beautiful stuff. This sediment is     percent made up of the shells of microscopic plants. And these plants need sunlight  so we know when we find that sediment there's no ice overhead. And we saw about    alternations between open water and ice covered water  between gravels and these plant sediments. So what that means is  what it tells us is that the Ross Sea region  this ice shelf  melted back and formed anew about    times. And this is in the past four million years. This was completely unexpected. Nobody imagined that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet was this dynamic. In fact  the lore for many years has been   The ice formed many tens of millions of years ago  and it's been there ever since.  And now we know that in our recent past it melted back and formed again  and sea level went up and down  six meters at a time. What caused it  Well  we're pretty sure that it's very small changes in the amount of sunlight reaching Antarctica  just caused by natural changes in the orbit of the Earth. But here's the key thing  you know  the other thing we found out is that the ice sheet passed a threshold  that the planet warmed up enough    and the number's about one degree to one and a half degrees Centigrade    the planet warmed up enough that it became ... that ice sheet became very dynamic and was very easily melted. And you know what  We've actually changed the temperature in the last century just the right amount. So many of us are convinced now that West Antarctica  the West Antarctic Ice Sheet  is starting to melt. We do expect to see a sea level rise on the order of one to two meters by the end of this century. And it could be larger than that. This is a serious consequence for nations like Kiribati  you know  where the average elevation is about a little over a meter above sea level. Okay  the second story takes place here in Galapagos. This is a bleached coral  coral that died during the      '   El Nino. This is from Champion Island. It's about a meter tall Pavona clavus colony. And it's covered with algae. That's what happens. When these things die  immediately  organisms come in and encrust and live on that dead surface. And so  when a coral colony is killed by an El Nino event  it leaves this indelible record. You can go then and study corals and figure out how often do you see this. So one of the things thought of in the '  s was to go back and take cores of coral heads throughout the Galapagos and find out how often was there a devastating event. And just so you know       '    that El Nino killed    percent of all the corals here in Galapagos. Then there was similar mortality in '   '  . And what we found after drilling back in time two to     years was that these were unique events. We saw no other mass mortality events. So these events in our recent past really are unique. So they're either just truly monster El Ninos  or they're just very strong El Ninos that occurred against a backdrop of global warming. Either case  it's bad news for the corals of the Galapagos Islands. Here's how we sample the corals. This is actually Easter Island. Look at this monster. This coral is eight meters tall  right. And it been growing for about     years. Now  Sylvia Earle turned me on to this exact same coral. And she was diving here with John Lauret    I think it was         and collected a little nugget and sent it to me. And we started working on it  and we figured out we could tell the temperature of the ancient ocean from analyzing a coral like this. So we have a diamond drill. We're not killing the colony  we're taking a small core sample out of the top. The core comes up as these cylindrical tubes of limestone. And that material then we take back to the lab and analyze it. You can see some of the coral cores there on the right. So we've done that all over the Eastern Pacific. We're starting to do it in the Western Pacific as well. I'll take you back here to the Galapagos Islands. And we've been working at this fascinating uplift here in Urbina Bay. That the place where  during an earthquake in       this marine terrace was lifted up out of the ocean very quickly  and it was lifted up about six to seven meters. And so now you can walk through a coral reef without getting wet. If you go on the ground there  it looks like this  and this is the grandaddy coral. It's    meters in diameter  and we know that it started growing in the year     . Imagine that. And that coral was growing happily in those shallow waters  until       when the earthquake happened. Now the reason we know it's      is that these corals have growth bands. When you cut them  slice those cores in half and x ray them  you see these light and dark bands. Each one of those is a year. We know these corals grow about a centimeter and a half a year. And we just count on down to the bottom. Then their other attribute is that they have this great chemistry. We can analyze the carbonate that makes up the coral  and there's a whole bunch of things we can do. But in this case  we measured the different isotopes of oxygen. Their ratio tells us the water temperature. In this example here  we had monitored this reef in Galapagos with temperature recorders  so we know the temperature of the water the coral's growing in. Then after we harvest a coral  we measure this ratio  and now you can see  those curves match perfectly. In this case  at these islands  you know  corals are instrumental quality recorders of change in the water. And of course  our thermometers only take us back    years or so here. The coral can take us back hundreds and thousands of years. So  what we do  we've merged a lot of different data sets. It's not just my group  there's maybe    groups worldwide doing this. But we get these instrumental  and near instrumental quality records of temperature change that go back hundreds of years  and we put them together. Here's a synthetic diagram. There's a whole family of curves here. But what's happening  we're looking at the last thousand years of temperature on the planet. And there's five or six different compilations there  But each one of those compilations reflects input from hundreds of these kinds of records from corals. We do similar things with ice cores. We work with tree rings. And that's how we discover what is truly natural and how different is the last century  right  And I chose this one because it's complicated and messy looking  right. This is as messy as it gets. You can see there's some signals there. Some of the records show lower temperatures than others. Some of them show greater variability. But they all tell us what the natural variability is. Some of them are from the northern hemisphere  some are from the entire globe. But here's what we can say  what's natural in the last thousand years is that the planet was cooling down. It was cooling down until about      or so. And there is natural variability caused by the Sun  caused by El Ninos. A century scale  decadal scale variability  and we know the magnitude  it's about two tenths to four tenths of a degree Centigrade. But then at the very end is where we have the instrumental record in black. And there's the temperature up there in     . You know  we've warmed the globe about a degree Centigrade in the last century  and there's nothing in the natural part of that record that resembles what we've seen in the last century. You know  that's the strength of our argument  that we are doing something that's truly different. So I'll close with a short discussion of ocean acidification. I like it as a component of global change to talk about  because  even if you are a hard bitten global warming skeptic  and I talk to that community fairly often  you cannot deny the simple physics of CO  dissolving in the ocean. You know  we're pumping out lots of CO  into the atmosphere  from fossil fuels  from cement production. Right now  about a third of that carbon dioxide is dissolving straight into the sea  right  And as it does so  it makes the ocean more acidic. So  you cannot argue with that. That is what's happening right now  and it's a very different issue than the global warming issue. It has many consequences. There's consequences for carbonate organisms. There are many organisms that build their shells out of calcium carbonate    plants and animals both. The main framework material of coral reefs is calcium carbonate. That material is more soluble in acidic fluid. So one of the things we're seeing is organisms are having to spend more metabolic energy to build and maintain their shells. At some point  as this transience  as this CO  uptake in the ocean continues  that material's actually going to start to dissolve. And on coral reefs  where some of the main framework organisms disappear  we will see a major loss of marine biodiversity. But it's not just the carbonate producers that are affected. There's many physiological processes that are influenced by the acidity of the ocean. So many reactions involving enzymes and proteins are sensitive to the acid content of the ocean. So  all of these things    greater metabolic demands  reduced reproductive success  changes in respiration and metabolism. You know  these are things that we have good physiological reasons to expect to see stressed caused by this transience. So we figured out some pretty interesting ways to track CO  levels in the atmosphere  going back millions of years. We used to do it just with ice cores  but in this case  we're going back    million years. And we take samples of the sediment  and it tells us the CO  level of the ocean  and therefore the CO  level of the atmosphere. And here's the thing  you have to go back about    million years to find a time when CO  levels were about what they are today. You have to go back about    million years to find a time when CO  levels were double what they are today. Now  what that means is that all of the organisms that live in the sea have evolved in this chemostatted ocean  with CO  levels lower than they are today. That's the reason that they're not able to respond or adapt to this rapid acidification that's going on right now. So  Charlie Veron came up with this statement last year   The prospect of ocean acidification may well be the most serious of all of the predicted outcomes of anthropogenic CO  release.  And I think that may very well be true  so I'll close with this. You know  we do need the protected areas  absolutely  but for the sake of the oceans  we have to cap or limit CO  emissions as soon as possible. Thank you very much. If nothing else  at least I've discovered what it is we put our speakers through  sweaty palms  sleepless nights  a wholly unnatural fear of clocks. I mean  it's quite brutal. And I'm also a little nervous about this. There are nine billion humans coming our way. Now  the most optimistic dreams can get dented by the prospect of people plundering the planet. But recently  I've become intrigued by a different way of thinking of large human crowds  because there are circumstances where they can do something really cool. It's a phenomenon that I think any organization or individual can tap into. It certainly impacted the way we think about TED's future  and perhaps the world's future overall. So  let's explore. The story starts with just a single person  a child  behaving a little strangely. This kid is known online as Lil Demon. He's doing tricks here  dance tricks  that probably no six year old in history ever managed before. How did he learn them  And what drove him to spend the hundreds of hours of practice this must have taken  Here's a clue.   Step your game up. Oh. Oh.   Chris Anderson  So  that was sent to me by this man  a filmmaker  Jonathan Chu  who told me that was the moment he realized the Internet was causing dance to evolve. This is what he said at TED in February. In essence  dancers were challenging each other online to get better  incredible new dance skills were being invented  even the six year olds were joining in. It felt like a revolution. And so Jon had a brilliant idea  He went out to recruit the best of the best dancers off of YouTube to create this dance troupe    The League of Extraordinary Dancers  the LXD. I mean  these kids were web taught  but they were so good that they got to play at the Oscars this year. And at TED here in February  their passion and brilliance just took our breath away. So  this story of the evolution of dance seems strangely familiar. You know  a while after TEDTalks started taking off  we noticed that speakers were starting to spend a lot more time in preparation. It was resulting in incredible new talks like these two. ... Months of preparation crammed into    minutes  raising the bar cruelly for the next generation of speakers  with the effects that we've seen this week. It's not as if J.J. and Jill actually ended their talks saying   Step your game up   but they might as well have. So  in both of these cases  you've got these cycles of improvement  apparently driven by people watching web video. What is going on here  Well  I think it's the latest iteration of a phenomenon we can call  crowd accelerated innovation.  And there are just three things you need for this thing to kick into gear. You can think of them as three dials on a giant wheel. You turn up the dials  the wheel starts to turn. And the first thing you need is ... a crowd  a group of people who share a common interest. The bigger the crowd  the more potential innovators there are. That's important  but actually most people in the crowd occupy these other roles. They're creating the ecosystem from which innovation emerges. The second thing you need is light. You need clear  open visibility of what the best people in that crowd are capable of  because that is how you will learn how you will be empowered to participate. And third  you need desire. You know  innovation's hard work. It's based on hundreds of hours of research  of practice. Absent desire  not going to happen. Now  here's an example    pre Internet    of this machine in action. Dancers at a street corner    it's a crowd  a small one  but they can all obviously see what each other can do. And the desire part comes  I guess  from social status  right  Best dancer walks tall  gets the best date. There's probably going to be some innovation happening here. But on the web  all three dials are ratcheted right up. The dance community is now global. There's millions connected. And amazingly  you can still see what the best can do  because the crowd itself shines a light on them  either directly  through comments  ratings  email  Facebook  Twitter  or indirectly  through numbers of views  through links that point Google there. So  it's easy to find the good stuff  and when you've found it  you can watch it in close up repeatedly and read what hundreds of people have written about it. That's a lot of light. But the desire element is really dialed way up. I mean  you might just be a kid with a webcam  but if you can do something that goes viral  you get to be seen by the equivalent of sports stadiums crammed with people. You get hundreds of strangers writing excitedly about you. And even if it's not that eloquent    and it's not    it can still really make your day. So  this possibility of a new type of global recognition  I think  is driving huge amounts of effort. And it's important to note that it's not just the stars who are benefiting  because you can see the best  everyone can learn. Also  the system is self fueling. It's the crowd that shines the light and fuels the desire  but the light and desire are a lethal one two combination that attract new people to the crowd. So  this is a model that pretty much any organization could use to try and nurture its own cycle of crowd accelerated innovation. Invite the crowd  let in the light  dial up the desire. And the hardest part about that is probably the light  because it means you have to open up  you have to show your stuff to the world. It's by giving away what you think is your deepest secret that maybe millions of people are empowered to help improve it. And  very happily  there's one class of people who really can't make use of this tool. The dark side of the web is allergic to the light. I don't think we're going to see terrorists  for example  publishing their plans online and saying to the world   Please  could you help us to actually make them work this time   But you can publish your stuff online. And if you can get that wheel to turn  look out. So  at TED  we've become a little obsessed with this idea of openness. In fact  my colleague  June Cohen  has taken to calling it  radical openness   because it works for us each time. We opened up our talks to the world  and suddenly there are millions of people out there helping spread our speakers' ideas  and thereby making it easier for us to recruit and motivate the next generation of speakers. By opening up our translation program  thousands of heroic volunteers    some of them watching online right now  and thank you     have translated our talks into more than    languages  thereby tripling our viewership in non English speaking countries. By giving away our TEDx brand  we suddenly have a thousand plus live experiments in the art of spreading ideas. And these organizers  they're seeing each other  they're learning from each other. We are learning from them. We're getting great talks back from them. The wheel is turning. Okay  step back a minute. I mean  it's really not news for me to tell you that innovation emerges out of groups. You know  we've heard that this week    this romantic notion of the lone genius with the  eureka   moment that changes the world is misleading. Even he said that  and he would know. We're a social species. We spark off each other. It's also not news to say that the Internet has accelerated innovation. For the past    years  powerful communities have been connecting online  sparking off each other. If you take programmers  you know  the whole open source movement is a fantastic instance of crowd accelerated innovation. But what's key here is  the reason these groups have been able to connect is because their work output is of the type that can be easily shared digitally    a picture  a music file  software. And that's why what I'm excited about  and what I think is under reported  is the significance of the rise of online video. This is the technology that's going to allow the rest of the world's talents to be shared digitally  thereby launching a whole new cycle of crowd accelerated innovation. The first few years of the web were pretty much video free  for this reason  video files are huge  the web couldn't handle them. But in the last    years  bandwidth has exploded a hundredfold. Suddenly  here we are. Humanity watches    million hours of YouTube every day. Cisco actually estimates that  within four years  more than    percent of the web's data will be video. If it's all puppies  porn and piracy  we're doomed. I don't think it will be. Video is high bandwidth for a reason. It packs a huge amount of data  and our brains are uniquely wired to decode it. Here  let me introduce you to Sam Haber. He's a unicyclist. Before YouTube  there was no way for him to discover his sport's true potential  because you can't communicate this stuff in words  right  But looking at video clips posted by strangers  a world of possibility opens up for him. Suddenly  he starts to emulate and then to innovate. And a global community of unicyclists discover each other online  inspire each other to greatness. And there are thousands of other examples of this happening    of video driven evolution of skills  ranging from the physical to the artful. And I have to tell you  as a former publisher of hobbyist magazines  I find this strangely beautiful. I mean  there's a lot of passion right here on this screen. But if Rube Goldberg machines and video poetry aren't quite your cup of tea  how about this. Jove is a website that was founded to encourage scientists to publish their peer reviewed research on video. There's a problem with a traditional scientific paper. It can take months for a scientist in another lab to figure out how to replicate the experiments that are described in print. Here's one such frustrated scientist  Moshe Pritsker  the founder of Jove. He told me that the world is wasting billions of dollars on this. But look at this video. I mean  look  if you can show instead of just describing  that problem goes away. So it's not far fetched to say that  at some point  online video is going to dramatically accelerate scientific advance. Here's another example that's close to our hearts at TED  where video is sometimes more powerful than print    the sharing of an idea. Why do people like watching TEDTalks  All those ideas are already out there in print. It's actually faster to read than to view. Why would someone bother  Well  so  there's some showing as well as telling. But even leaving the screen out of it  there's still a lot more being transferred than just words. And in that non verbal portion  there's some serious magic. Somewhere hidden in the physical gestures  the vocal cadence  the facial expressions  the eye contact  the passion  the kind of awkward  British body language  the sense of how the audience are reacting  there are hundreds of subconscious clues that go to how well you will understand  and whether you're inspired    light  if you like  and desire. Incredibly  all of this can be communicated on just a few square inches of a screen. Reading and writing are actually relatively recent inventions. Face to face communication has been fine tuned by millions of years of evolution. That's what's made it into this mysterious  powerful thing it is. Someone speaks  there's resonance in all these receiving brains  the whole group acts together. I mean  this is the connective tissue of the human superorganism in action. It's probably driven our culture for millennia.     years ago  it ran into a competitor with a lethal advantage. It's right here. Print scaled. The world's ambitious innovators and influencers now could get their ideas to spread far and wide  and so the art of the spoken word pretty much withered on the vine. But now  in the blink of an eye  the game has changed again. It's not too much to say that what Gutenberg did for writing  online video can now do for face to face communication. So  that primal medium  which your brain is exquisitely wired for ... that just went global. Now  this is big. We may have to reinvent an ancient art form. I mean  today  one person speaking can be seen by millions  shedding bright light on potent ideas  creating intense desire for learning and to respond    and in his case  intense desire to laugh. For the first time in human history  talented students don't have to have their potential and their dreams written out of history by lousy teachers. They can sit two feet in front of the world's finest. Now  TED is just a small part of this. I mean  the world's universities are opening up their curricula. Thousands of individuals and organizations are sharing their knowledge and data online. Thousands of people are figuring out new ways to learn and  crucially  to respond  completing the cycle. And so  as we've thought about this  you know  it's become clear to us what the next stage of TED's evolution has to be. TEDTalks can't be a one way process  one to many. Our future is many to many. So  we're dreaming of ways to make it easier for you  the global TED community  to respond to speakers  to contribute your own ideas  maybe even your own TEDTalks  and to help shine a light on the very best of what's out there. Because  if we can bubble up the very best from a vastly larger pool  this wheel turns. Now  is it possible to imagine a similar process to this  happening to global education overall  I mean  does it have to be this painful  top down process  Why not a self fueling cycle in which we all can participate  It's the participation age  right  Schools can't be silos. We can't stop learning at age   . What if  in the coming crowd of nine billion ... what if that crowd could learn enough to be net contributors  instead of net plunderers  That changes everything  right  I mean  that would take more teachers than we've ever had. But the good news is they are out there. They're in the crowd  and the crowd is switching on lights  and we can see them for the first time  not as an undifferentiated mass of strangers  but as individuals we can learn from. Who's the teacher  You're the teacher. You're part of the crowd that may be about to launch the biggest learning cycle in human history  a cycle capable of carrying all of us to a smarter  wiser  more beautiful place. Here's a group of kids in a village in Pakistan near where I grew up. Within five years  each of these kids is going to have access to a cellphone capable of full on web video and capable of uploading video to the web. I mean  is it crazy to think that this girl  in the back  at the right  in    years  might be sharing the idea that keeps the world beautiful for your grandchildren  It's not crazy  it's actually happening right now. I want to introduce you to a good friend of TED who just happens to live in Africa's biggest shantytown. I'm one of the organizers of TEDxKibera. There are so many good things which are happening right here in Kibera. There's a self help group. They turned a trash place into a garden. The same spot  it was a crime spot where people were being robbed. They used the same trash to form green manure. The same trash site is feeding more than    families. We have our own film school. They are using Flip cameras to record  edit  and reporting to their own channel  Kibera TV. Because of a scarcity of land  we are using the sacks to grow vegetables  and also  we're  able to save on the cost of living. Change happens when we see things in a different way. Today  I see Kibera in a different way. My message to TEDGlobal and the entire world is  Kibera is a hotbed of innovation and ideas. CA  You know what  I bet Chris has always been an inspiring guy. What's new    and it's huge    is that  for the first time  we get to see him  and he can see us. Right now  Chris and Kevin and Dennis and Dickson and their friends are watching us  in Nairobi  right now. Guys  we've learned from you today. Thank you. And thank you. Let's start with day and night. Life evolved under conditions of light and darkness  light and then darkness. And so plants and animals developed their own internal clocks so that they would be ready for these changes in light. These are chemical clocks  and they're found in every known being that has two or more cells and in some that only have one cell. I'll give you an example    if you take a horseshoe crab off the beach  and you fly it all the way across the continent  and you drop it into a sloped cage  it will scramble up the floor of the cage as the tide is rising on its home shores  and it'll skitter down again right as the water is receding thousands of miles away. It'll do this for weeks  until it kind of gradually loses the plot. And it's incredible to watch  but there's nothing psychic or paranormal going on  it's simply that these crabs have internal cycles that correspond  usually  with what's going on around it. So  we have this ability as well. And in humans  we call it the  body clock.  You can see this most clearly when you take away someone's watch and you shut them into a bunker  deep underground  for a couple of months.  Laughter  People actually volunteer for this  and they usually come out kind of raving about their productive time in the hole. So  no matter how atypical these subjects would have to be  they all show the same thing. They get up just a little bit later every day    say    minutes or so    and they kind of drift all the way around the clock like this over the course of the weeks. And so  in this way we know that they are working on their own internal clocks  rather than somehow sensing the day outside. So fine  we have a body clock  and it turns out that it's incredibly important in our lives. It's a huge driver for culture and I think that it's the most underrated force on our behavior. We evolved as a species near the equator  and so we're very well equipped to deal with    hours of daylight and    hours of darkness. But of course  we've spread to every corner of the globe and in Arctic Canada  where I live  we have perpetual daylight in summer and    hours of darkness in winter. So the culture  the northern aboriginal culture  traditionally has been highly seasonal. In winter  there's a lot of sleeping going on  you enjoy your family life inside. And in summer  it's almost manic hunting and working activity very long hours  very active. So  what would our natural rhythm look like  What would our sleeping patterns be in the sort of ideal sense  Well  it turns out that when people are living without any sort of artificial light at all  they sleep twice every night. They go to bed around      p.m. until midnight and then again  they sleep from about      a.m. until sunrise. And in between  they have a couple of hours of sort of meditative quiet in bed. And during this time  there's a surge of prolactin  the likes of which a modern day never sees. The people in these studies report feeling so awake during the daytime  that they realize they're experiencing true wakefulness for the first time in their lives. So  cut to the modern day. We're living in a culture of jet lag  global travel     hour business  shift work. And you know  our modern ways of doing things have their advantages  but I believe we should understand the costs. Thank you. For the last    years  I've been spending my time trying to figure out how and why human beings assemble themselves into social networks. And the kind of social network I'm talking about is not the recent online variety  but rather  the kind of social networks that human beings have been assembling for hundreds of thousands of years  ever since we emerged from the African savannah. So  I form friendships and co worker and sibling and relative relationships with other people who in turn have similar relationships with other people. And this spreads on out endlessly into a distance. And you get a network that looks like this. Every dot is a person. Every line between them is a relationship between two people    different kinds of relationships. And you can get this kind of vast fabric of humanity  in which we're all embedded. And my colleague  James Fowler and I have been studying for quite sometime what are the mathematical  social  biological and psychological rules that govern how these networks are assembled and what are the similar rules that govern how they operate  how they affect our lives. But recently  we've been wondering whether it might be possible to take advantage of this insight  to actually find ways to improve the world  to do something better  to actually fix things  not just understand things. So one of the first things we thought we would tackle would be how we go about predicting epidemics. And the current state of the art in predicting an epidemic    if you're the CDC or some other national body    is to sit in the middle where you are and collect data from physicians and laboratories in the field that report the prevalence or the incidence of certain conditions. So  so and so patients have been diagnosed with something  or other patients have been diagnosed  and all these data are fed into a central repository  with some delay. And if everything goes smoothly  one to two weeks from now you'll know where the epidemic was today. And actually  about a year or so ago  there was this promulgation of the idea of Google Flu Trends  with respect to the flu  where by looking at people's searching behavior today  we could know where the flu    what the status of the epidemic was today  what's the prevalence of the epidemic today. But what I'd like to show you today is a means by which we might get not just rapid warning about an epidemic  but also actually early detection of an epidemic. And  in fact  this idea can be used not just to predict epidemics of germs  but also to predict epidemics of all sorts of kinds. For example  anything that spreads by a form of social contagion could be understood in this way  from abstract ideas on the left like patriotism  or altruism  or religion to practices like dieting behavior  or book purchasing  or drinking  or bicycle helmet  and  other safety practices  or products that people might buy  purchases of electronic goods  anything in which there's kind of an interpersonal spread. A kind of a diffusion of innovation could be understood and predicted by the mechanism I'm going to show you now. So  as all of you probably know  the classic way of thinking about this is the diffusion of innovation  or the adoption curve. So here on the Y axis  we have the percent of the people affected  and on the X axis  we have time. And at the very beginning  not too many people are affected  and you get this classic sigmoidal  or S shaped  curve. And the reason for this shape is that at the very beginning  let's say one or two people are infected  or affected by the thing and then they affect  or infect  two people  who in turn affect four  eight     and so forth  and you get the epidemic growth phase of the curve. And eventually  you saturate the population. There are fewer and fewer people who are still available that you might infect  and then you get the plateau of the curve  and you get this classic sigmoidal curve. And this holds for germs  ideas  product adoption  behaviors  and the like. But things don't just diffuse in human populations at random. They actually diffuse through networks. Because  as I said  we live our lives in networks  and these networks have a particular kind of a structure. Now if you look at a network like this    this is     people. And the lines represent    the dots are the people  and the lines represent friendship relationships. You might see that people occupy different locations within the network. And there are different kinds of relationships between the people. You could have friendship relationships  sibling relationships  spousal relationships  co worker relationships  neighbor relationships and the like. And different sorts of things spread across different sorts of ties. For instance  sexually transmitted diseases will spread across sexual ties. Or  for instance  people's smoking behavior might be influenced by their friends. Or their altruistic or their charitable giving behavior might be influenced by their coworkers  or by their neighbors. But not all positions in the network are the same. So if you look at this  you might immediately grasp that different people have different numbers of connections. Some people have one connection  some have two  some have six  some have    connections. And this is called the  degree  of a node  or the number of connections that a node has. But in addition  there's something else. So  if you look at nodes A and B  they both have six connections. But if you can see this image  of the network  from a bird's eye view  you can appreciate that there's something very different about nodes A and B. So  let me ask you this    I can cultivate this intuition by asking a question    who would you rather be if a deadly germ was spreading through the network  A or B  B is located on the edge of the network. Now  who would you rather be if a juicy piece of gossip were spreading through the network  A. And you have an immediate appreciation that A is going to be more likely to get the thing that's spreading and to get it sooner by virtue of their structural location within the network. A  in fact  is more central  and this can be formalized mathematically. So  if we want to track something that was spreading through a network  what we ideally would like to do is to set up sensors on the central individuals within the network  including node A  monitor those people that are right there in the middle of the network  and somehow get an early detection of whatever it is that is spreading through the network. So if you saw them contract a germ or a piece of information  you would know that  soon enough  everybody was about to contract this germ or this piece of information. And this would be much better than monitoring six randomly chosen people  without reference to the structure of the population. And in fact  if you could do that  what you would see is something like this. On the left hand panel  again  we have the S shaped curve of adoption. In the dotted red line  we show what the adoption would be in the random people  and in the left hand line  shifted to the left  we show what the adoption would be in the central individuals within the network. On the Y axis is the cumulative instances of contagion  and on the X axis is the time. And on the right hand side  we show the same data  but here with daily incidence. And what we show here is    like  here    very few people are affected  more and more and more and up to here  and here's the peak of the epidemic. But shifted to the left is what's occurring in the central individuals. And this difference in time between the two is the early detection  the early warning we can get  about an impending epidemic in the human population. The problem  however  is that mapping human social networks is not always possible. It can be expensive  not feasible  unethical  or  frankly  just not possible to do such a thing. So  how can we figure out who the central people are in a network without actually mapping the network  What we came up with was an idea to exploit an old fact  or a known fact  about social networks  which goes like this  Do you know that your friends have more friends than you do  Your friends have more friends than you do  and this is known as the friendship paradox. Imagine a very popular person in the social network    like a party host who has hundreds of friends    and a misanthrope who has just one friend  and you pick someone at random from the population  they were much more likely to know the party host. And if they nominate the party host as their friend  that party host has a hundred friends  therefore  has more friends than they do. And this  in essence  is what's known as the friendship paradox. The friends of randomly chosen people have higher degree  and are more central than the random people themselves. And you can get an intuitive appreciation for this if you imagine just the people at the perimeter of the network. If you pick this person  the only friend they have to nominate is this person  who  by construction  must have at least two and typically more friends. And that happens at every peripheral node. And in fact  it happens throughout the network as you move in  everyone you pick  when they nominate a random    when a random person nominates a friend of theirs  you move closer to the center of the network. So  we thought we would exploit this idea in order to study whether we could predict phenomena within networks. Because now  with this idea we can take a random sample of people  have them nominate their friends  those friends would be more central  and we could do this without having to map the network. And we tested this idea with an outbreak of H N  flu at Harvard College in the fall and winter of       just a few months ago. We took       randomly selected undergraduates  we had them nominate their friends  and we followed both the random students and their friends daily in time to see whether or not they had the flu epidemic. And we did this passively by looking at whether or not they'd gone to university health services. And also  we had them  actively  email us a couple of times a week. Exactly what we predicted happened. So the random group is in the red line. The epidemic in the friends group has shifted to the left  over here. And the difference in the two is    days. By monitoring the friends group  we could get    days advance warning of an impending epidemic in this human population. Now  in addition to that  if you were an analyst who was trying to study an epidemic or to predict the adoption of a product  for example  what you could do is you could pick a random sample of the population  also have them nominate their friends and follow the friends and follow both the randoms and the friends. Among the friends  the first evidence you saw of a blip above zero in adoption of the innovation  for example  would be evidence of an impending epidemic. Or you could see the first time the two curves diverged  as shown on the left. When did the randoms    when did the friends take off and leave the randoms  and  when did  their curve start shifting  And that  as indicated by the white line  occurred    days before the peak of the epidemic. So this would be a technique whereby we could get more than a month and a half warning about a flu epidemic in a particular population. I should say that how far advanced a notice one might get about something depends on a host of factors. It could depend on the nature of the pathogen    different pathogens  using this technique  you'd get different warning    or other phenomena that are spreading  or frankly  on the structure of the human network. Now in our case  although it wasn't necessary  we could also actually map the network of the students. So  this is a map of     students and their friendship ties. And in a minute now  I'm going to put this map into motion. We're going to take daily cuts through the network for     days. The red dots are going to be cases of the flu  and the yellow dots are going to be friends of the people with the flu. And the size of the dots is going to be proportional to how many of their friends have the flu. So bigger dots mean more of your friends have the flu. And if you look at this image    here we are now in September the   th    you're going to see a few cases light up. You're going to see kind of blooming of the flu in the middle. Here we are on October the   th. The slope of the epidemic curve is approaching now  in November. Bang  bang  bang  bang  bang    you're going to see lots of blooming in the middle  and then you're going to see a sort of leveling off  fewer and fewer cases towards the end of December. And this type of a visualization can show that epidemics like this take root and affect central individuals first  before they affect others. Now  as I've been suggesting  this method is not restricted to germs  but actually to anything that spreads in populations. Information spreads in populations  norms can spread in populations  behaviors can spread in populations. And by behaviors  I can mean things like criminal behavior  or voting behavior  or health care behavior  like smoking  or vaccination  or product adoption  or other kinds of behaviors that relate to interpersonal influence. If I'm likely to do something that affects others around me  this technique can get early warning or early detection about the adoption within the population. The key thing is that for it to work  there has to be interpersonal influence. It cannot be because of some broadcast mechanism affecting everyone uniformly. Now the same insights can also be exploited    with respect to networks    can also be exploited in other ways  for example  in the use of targeting specific people for interventions. So  for example  most of you are probably familiar with the notion of herd immunity. So  if we have a population of a thousand people  and we want to make the population immune to a pathogen  we don't have to immunize every single person. If we immunize     of them  it's as if we had immunized a hundred  percent  of them. Because even if one or two of the non immune people gets infected  there's no one for them to infect. They are surrounded by immunized people. So    percent is as good as     percent. Well  some other scientists have estimated what would happen if you took a    percent random sample of these      people      people and immunized them. Would you get any population level immunity  And the answer is no. But if you took this    percent  these     people and had them nominate their friends and took the same number of vaccine doses and vaccinated the friends of the        the     friends    you can get the same level of herd immunity as if you had vaccinated    percent of the population at a much greater efficiency  with a strict budget constraint. And similar ideas can be used  for instance  to target distribution of things like bed nets in the developing world. If we could understand the structure of networks in villages  we could target to whom to give the interventions to foster these kinds of spreads. Or  frankly  for advertising with all kinds of products. If we could understand how to target  it could affect the efficiency of what we're trying to achieve. And in fact  we can use data from all kinds of sources nowadays  to do this . This is a map of eight million phone users in a European country. Every dot is a person  and every line represents a volume of calls between the people. And we can use such data  that's being passively obtained  to map these whole countries and understand who is located where within the network. Without actually having to query them at all  we can get this kind of a structural insight. And other sources of information  as you're no doubt aware are available about such features  from email interactions  online interactions  online social networks and so forth. And in fact  we are in the era of what I would call  massive passive  data collection efforts. They're all kinds of ways we can use massively collected data to create sensor networks to follow the population  understand what's happening in the population  and intervene in the population for the better. Because these new technologies tell us not just who is talking to whom  but where everyone is  and what they're thinking based on what they're uploading on the Internet  and what they're buying based on their purchases. And all this administrative data can be pulled together and processed to understand human behavior in a way we never could before. So  for example  we could use truckers' purchases of fuel. So the truckers are just going about their business  and they're buying fuel. And we see a blip up in the truckers' purchases of fuel  and we know that a recession is about to end. Or we can monitor the velocity with which people are moving with their phones on a highway  and the phone company can see  as the velocity is slowing down  that there's a traffic jam. And they can feed that information back to their subscribers  but only to their subscribers on the same highway located behind the traffic jam  Or we can monitor doctors prescribing behaviors  passively  and see how the diffusion of innovation with pharmaceuticals occurs within  networks of  doctors. Or again  we can monitor purchasing behavior in people and watch how these types of phenomena can diffuse within human populations. And there are three ways  I think  that these massive passive data can be used. One is fully passive  like I just described    as in  for instance  the trucker example  where we don't actually intervene in the population in any way. One is quasi active  like the flu example I gave  where we get some people to nominate their friends and then passively monitor their friends    do they have the flu  or not     and then get warning. Or another example would be  if you're a phone company  you figure out who's central in the network and you ask those people   Look  will you just text us your fever every day  Just text us your temperature.  And collect vast amounts of information about people's temperature  but from centrally located individuals. And be able  on a large scale  to monitor an impending epidemic with very minimal input from people. Or  finally  it can be more fully active    as I know subsequent speakers will also talk about today    where people might globally participate in wikis  or photographing  or monitoring elections  and upload information in a way that allows us to pool information in order to understand social processes and social phenomena. In fact  the availability of these data  I think  heralds a kind of new era of what I and others would like to call  computational social science.  It's sort of like when Galileo invented    or  didn't invent    came to use a telescope and could see the heavens in a new way  or Leeuwenhoek became aware of the microscope    or actually invented    and could see biology in a new way. But now we have access to these kinds of data that allow us to understand social processes and social phenomena in an entirely new way that was never before possible. And with this science  we can understand how exactly the whole comes to be greater than the sum of its parts. And actually  we can use these insights to improve society and improve human well being. Thank you. Now  since this is TEDGlobal  who can tell me what this is called in French  I see you're all up on the history of hurdy gurdy     vielle   roue.  And in Spanish   zanfona.  And in Italian   ghironda   okay  Hurdy gurdy  or wheel fiddle. So  these are the different kinds and shapes of the hurdy gurdy. The hurdy gurdy is the only musical instrument that uses a crank to turn a wheel to rub strings  like the bow of a violin  to produce music. It has three different kinds of strings. The first string is the drone string  which plays a continuous sound like the bagpipe. The second string is a melody string  which is played with a wooden keyboard tuned like a piano. And the third string is pretty innovative. It's also the only instrument that uses this kind of technique. It activates what's called the buzzing bridge  or the dog. When I turn the crank and I apply pressure  it makes a sound like a barking dog. So all of this is pretty innovative  if you consider that the hurdy gurdy appeared about a thousand years ago and it took two people to play it  one to turn the crank  and another person    yes    to play the melody by physically pulling up large wooden pegs. Luckily  all of this changed a couple of centuries later. So  one person could actually play and almost    this is pretty heavy    carry the hurdy gurdy. The hurdy gurdy has been used  historically  through the centuries in mostly dance music because of the uniqueness of the melody combined with the acoustic boombox here. And today  the hurdy gurdy is used in all sorts of music    traditional folk music  dance  contemporary and world music    in the U.K.  in France  in Spain and in Italy. And this kind of hurdy gurdy takes anywhere from three to five years  to order and receive it . It's made by specialized luthiers  also in Europe. And it's very difficult to tune. So without further ado  would you like to hear it  Caroline Phillips  I didn't hear you. Would you like to hear it   Audience  Yes   CP  Okay. There I go. I'd like to sing in Basque  which is the language spoken in the Basque Country where I live  in the region in France and Spain.  Basque  Thank you. This is a song that I wrote based on traditional Basque rhythms. And this is a song that has a kind of a Celtic feel. Thank you. Thank you. Hello. I would like to start my talk with actually two questions  and the first one is  How many people here actually eat pig meat  Please raise your hand    oh  that's a lot. And how many people have actually seen a live pig producing this meat  In the last year  In the Netherlands    where I come from    you actually never see a pig  which is really strange  because  on a population of    million people  we have    million pigs. And well  of course  the Dutch can't eat all these pigs. They eat about one third  and the rest is exported to all kinds of countries in Europe and the rest of the world. A lot goes to the U.K.  Germany. And what I was curious about    because historically  the whole pig would be used up until the last bit so nothing would be wasted    and I was curious to find out if this was actually still the case. And I spent about three years researching. And I followed this one pig with number          all the way up until the end and to what products it's made of. And in these years  I met all kinds people like  for instance  farmers and butchers  which seems logical. But I also met aluminum mold makers  ammunition producers and all kinds of people. And what was striking to me is that the farmers actually had no clue what was made of their pigs  but the consumers    as in us    had also no idea of the pigs being in all these products. So what I did is  I took all this research and I made it into a    well  basically it's a product catalog of this one pig  and it carries a duplicate of his ear tag on the back. And it consists of seven chapters    the chapters are skin  bones  meat  internal organs  blood  fat and miscellaneous. In total  they weigh    .  kilograms. And to show you how often you actually meet part of this pig in a regular day  I want to show you some images of the book. You probably start the day with a shower. So  in soap  fatty acids made from boiling pork bone fat are used as a hardening agent  but also for giving it a pearl like effect. Then if you look around you in the bathroom  you see lots more products like shampoo  conditioner  anti wrinkle cream  body lotion  but also toothpaste. Then  so  before breakfast  you've already met the pig so many times. Then  at breakfast  the pig that I followed  the hairs off the pig or proteins from the hairs off the pig were used as an improver of dough. Well  that's what the producer says  it's  improving the dough  of course.  In low fat butter  or actually in many low fat products  when you take the fat out  you actually take the taste and the texture out. So what they do is they put gelatin back in  in order to retain the texture. Well  when you're off to work  under the road or under the buildings that you see  there might very well be cellular concrete  which is a very light kind of concrete that's actually got proteins from bones inside and it's also fully reusable. In the train brakes    at least in the German train brakes    there's this part of the brake that's made of bone ash. And in cheesecake and all kinds of desserts  like chocolate mousse  tiramisu  vanilla pudding  everything that's cooled in the supermarket  there's gelatin to make it look good. Fine bone china    this is a real classic. Of course  the bone in fine bone china gives it its translucency and also its strength  in order to make these really fine shapes  like this deer. In interior decorating  the pig's actually quite there. It's used in paint for the texture  but also for the glossiness. In sandpaper  bone glue is actually the glue between the sand and the paper. And then in paintbrushes  hairs are used because  apparently  they're very suitable for making paintbrushes because of their hard wearing nature. I was not planning on showing you any meat because  of course  half the book's meat and you probably all know what meats they are. But I didn't want you to miss out on this one  because this  well  it's called  portion controlled meat cuts.  And this is actually sold in the frozen area of the supermarket. And what it is    it's actually steak. So  this is sold as cow  but what happens when you slaughter a cow    at least in industrial factory farming    they have all these little bits of steak left that they can't actually sell as steak  so what they do is they glue them all together with fibrin from pig blood into this really large sausage  then freeze the sausage  cut it in little slices and sell those as steak again. And this also actually happens with tuna and scallops. So  with the steak  you might drink a beer. In the brewing process  there's lots of cloudy elements in the beer  so to get rid of these cloudy elements  what some companies do is they pour the beer through a sort of gelatin sieve in order to get rid of that cloudiness. This actually also goes for wine as well as fruit juice. There's actually a company in Greece that produces these cigarettes that actually contain hemoglobin from pigs in the filter. And according to them  this creates an artificial lung in the filter. So  this is actually a healthier cigarette. Injectable collagen    or  since the '  s  collagen from pigs    has been used for injecting into wrinkles. And the reason for this is that pigs are actually quite close to human beings  so the collagen is as well. Well  this must be the strangest thing I found. This is a bullet coming from a very large ammunition company in the United States. And while I was making the book  I contacted all the producers of products because I wanted them to send me the real samples and the real specimens. So I sent this company an email saying   Hello. I'm Christien. I'm doing this research. And can you send me a bullet   And well  I didn't expect them to even answer my email. But they answered and they said   Why  thank you for your email. What an interesting story. Are you in anyway related to the Dutch government   I thought that was really weird  as if the Dutch government sends emails to anyone. So  the most beautiful thing I found    at least what I think is the most beautiful    in the book  is this heart valve. It's actually a very low tech and very high tech product at the same time. The low tech bit is that it's literally a pig's heart valve mounted in the high tech bit  which is a memory metal casing. And what happens is this can be implanted into a human heart without open heart surgery. And once it's in the right spot  they remove the outer shell  and the heart valve  well  it gets this shape and at that moment it starts beating  instantly. It's really a sort of magical moment. So this is actually a Dutch company  so I called them up  and I asked   Can I borrow a heart valve from you   And the makers of this thing were really enthusiastic. So they were like   Okay  we'll put it in a jar for you with formalin  and you can borrow it.  Great    and then I didn't hear from them for weeks  so I called  and I asked   What's going on with the heart valve   And they said   Well the director of the company decided not to let you borrow this heart valve  because want his product to be associated with pigs.  Well  the last product from the book that I'm showing you is renewable energy    actually  to show that my first question  if pigs are still used up until the last bit  was still true. Well it is  because everything that can't be used for anything else is made into a fuel that can be used as renewable energy source. In total  I found     products. And what they showed me is that  well  firstly  it's at least to say odd that we don't treat these pigs as absolute kings and queens. And the second  is that we actually don't have a clue of what all these products that surround us are made of. And you might think I'm very fond of pigs  but actually    well  I am a little bit    but I'm more fond of raw materials in general. And I think that  in order to take better care of what's behind our products    so  the livestock  the crops  the plants  the non renewable materials  but also the people that produce these products    the first step would actually be to know that they are there. Thank you very much. Just a few minutes ago  I took this picture about    blocks from here. This is the Grand Cafe here in Oxford. I took this picture because this turns out to be the first coffeehouse to open in England in     . That's its great claim to fame  and I wanted to show it to you  not because I want to give you the kind of Starbucks tour of historic England  but rather because the English coffeehouse was crucial to the development and spread of one of the great intellectual flowerings of the last     years  what we now call the Enlightenment. And the coffeehouse played such a big role in the birth of the Enlightenment  in part  because of what people were drinking there. Because  before the spread of coffee and tea through British culture  what people drank    both elite and mass folks drank    day in and day out  from dawn until dusk was alcohol. Alcohol was the daytime beverage of choice. You would drink a little beer with breakfast and have a little wine at lunch  a little gin    particularly around         and top it off with a little beer and wine at the end of the day. That was the healthy choice    right    because the water wasn't safe to drink. And so  effectively until the rise of the coffeehouse  you had an entire population that was effectively drunk all day. And you can imagine what that would be like  right  in your own life    and I know this is true of some of you    if you were drinking all day  and then you switched from a depressant to a stimulant in your life  you would have better ideas. You would be sharper and more alert. And so it's not an accident that a great flowering of innovation happened as England switched to tea and coffee. But the other thing that makes the coffeehouse important is the architecture of the space. It was a space where people would get together from different backgrounds  different fields of expertise  and share. It was a space  as Matt Ridley talked about  where ideas could have sex. This was their conjugal bed  in a sense    ideas would get together there. And an astonishing number of innovations from this period have a coffeehouse somewhere in their story. I've been spending a lot of time thinking about coffeehouses for the last five years  because I've been kind of on this quest to investigate this question of where good ideas come from. What are the environments that lead to unusual levels of innovation  unusual levels of creativity  What's the kind of environmental    what is the space of creativity  And what I've done is I've looked at both environments like the coffeehouse  I've looked at media environments  like the world wide web  that have been extraordinarily innovative  I've gone back to the history of the first cities  I've even gone to biological environments  like coral reefs and rainforests  that involve unusual levels of biological innovation  and what I've been looking for is shared patterns  kind of signature behavior that shows up again and again in all of these environments. Are there recurring patterns that we can learn from  that we can take and kind of apply to our own lives  or our own organizations  or our own environments to make them more creative and innovative  And I think I've found a few. But what you have to do to make sense of this and to really understand these principles is you have to do away with a lot of the way in which our conventional metaphors and language steers us towards certain concepts of idea creation. We have this very rich vocabulary to describe moments of inspiration. We have the kind of the flash of insight  the stroke of insight  we have epiphanies  we have  eureka   moments  we have the lightbulb moments  right  All of these concepts  as kind of rhetorically florid as they are  share this basic assumption  which is that an idea is a single thing  it's something that happens often in a wonderful illuminating moment. But in fact  what I would argue and what you really need to kind of begin with is this idea that an idea is a network on the most elemental level. I mean  this is what is happening inside your brain. An idea    a new idea    is a new network of neurons firing in sync with each other inside your brain. It's a new configuration that has never formed before. And the question is  how do you get your brain into environments where these new networks are going to be more likely to form  And it turns out that  in fact  the kind of network patterns of the outside world mimic a lot of the network patterns of the internal world of the human brain. So the metaphor I'd like the use I can take from a story of a great idea that's quite recent    a lot more recent than the     s. A wonderful guy named Timothy Prestero  who has a company called ... an organization called Design That Matters. They decided to tackle this really pressing problem of  you know  the terrible problems we have with infant mortality rates in the developing world. One of the things that's very frustrating about this is that we know  by getting modern neonatal incubators into any context  if we can keep premature babies warm  basically    it's very simple    we can halve infant mortality rates in those environments. So  the technology is there. These are standard in all the industrialized worlds. The problem is  if you buy a         incubator  and you send it off to a mid sized village in Africa  it will work great for a year or two years  and then something will go wrong and it will break  and it will remain broken forever  because you don't have a whole system of spare parts  and you don't have the on the ground expertise to fix this         piece of equipment. And so you end up having this problem where you spend all this money getting aid and all these advanced electronics to these countries  and then it ends up being useless. So what Prestero and his team decided to do is to look around and see  what are the abundant resources in these developing world contexts  And what they noticed was they don't have a lot of DVRs  they don't have a lot of microwaves  but they seem to do a pretty good job of keeping their cars on the road. There's a Toyota Forerunner on the street in all these places. They seem to have the expertise to keep cars working. So they started to think   Could we build a neonatal incubator that's built entirely out of automobile parts   And this is what they ended up coming with. It's called a  neonurture device.  From the outside  it looks like a normal little thing you'd find in a modern  Western hospital. In the inside  it's all car parts. It's got a fan  it's got headlights for warmth  it's got door chimes for alarm    it runs off a car battery. And so all you need is the spare parts from your Toyota and the ability to fix a headlight  and you can repair this thing. Now  that's a great idea  but what I'd like to say is that  in fact  this is a great metaphor for the way that ideas happen. We like to think our breakthrough ideas  you know  are like that          brand new incubator  state of the art technology  but more often than not  they're cobbled together from whatever parts that happen to be around nearby. We take ideas from other people  from people we've learned from  from people we run into in the coffee shop  and we stitch them together into new forms and we create something new. That's really where innovation happens. And that means that we have to change some of our models of what innovation and deep thinking really looks like  right. I mean  this is one vision of it. Another is Newton and the apple  when Newton was at Cambridge. This is a statue from Oxford. You know  you're sitting there thinking a deep thought  and the apple falls from the tree  and you have the theory of gravity. In fact  the spaces that have historically led to innovation tend to look like this  right. This is Hogarth's famous painting of a kind of political dinner at a tavern  but this is what the coffee shops looked like back then. This is the kind of chaotic environment where ideas were likely to come together  where people were likely to have new  interesting  unpredictable collisions    people from different backgrounds. So  if we're trying to build organizations that are more innovative  we have to build spaces that    strangely enough    look a little bit more like this. This is what your office should look like  is part of my message here. And one of the problems with this is that people are actually    when you research this field    people are notoriously unreliable  when they actually kind of self report on where they have their own good ideas  or their history of their best ideas. And a few years ago  a wonderful researcher named Kevin Dunbar decided to go around and basically do the Big Brother approach to figuring out where good ideas come from. He went to a bunch of science labs around the world and videotaped everyone as they were doing every little bit of their job. So when they were sitting in front of the microscope  when they were talking to their colleague at the water cooler  and all these things. And he recorded all of these conversations and tried to figure out where the most important ideas  where they happened. And when we think about the classic image of the scientist in the lab  we have this image    you know  they're pouring over the microscope  and they see something in the tissue sample. And  oh  eureka   they've got the idea. What happened actually when Dunbar kind of looked at the tape is that  in fact  almost all of the important breakthrough ideas did not happen alone in the lab  in front of the microscope. They happened at the conference table at the weekly lab meeting  when everybody got together and shared their kind of latest data and findings  oftentimes when people shared the mistakes they were having  the error  the noise in the signal they were discovering. And something about that environment    and I've started calling it the  liquid network   where you have lots of different ideas that are together  different backgrounds  different interests  jostling with each other  bouncing off each other    that environment is  in fact  the environment that leads to innovation. The other problem that people have is they like to condense their stories of innovation down to kind of shorter time frames. So they want to tell the story of the  eureka   moment. They want to say   There I was  I was standing there and I had it all suddenly clear in my head.  But in fact  if you go back and look at the historical record  it turns out that a lot of important ideas have very long incubation periods    I call this the  slow hunch.  We've heard a lot recently about hunch and instinct and blink like sudden moments of clarity  but in fact  a lot of great ideas linger on  sometimes for decades  in the back of people's minds. They have a feeling that there's an interesting problem  but they don't quite have the tools yet to discover them. They spend all this time working on certain problems  but there's another thing lingering there that they're interested in  but they can't quite solve. Darwin is a great example of this. Darwin himself  in his autobiography  tells the story of coming up with the idea for natural selection as a classic  eureka   moment. He's in his study  it's October of       and he's reading Malthus  actually  on population. And all of a sudden  the basic algorithm of natural selection kind of pops into his head and he says   Ah  at last  I had a theory with which to work.  That's in his autobiography. About a decade or two ago  a wonderful scholar named Howard Gruber went back and looked at Darwin's notebooks from this period. And Darwin kept these copious notebooks where he wrote down every little idea he had  every little hunch. And what Gruber found was that Darwin had the full theory of natural selection for months and months and months before he had his alleged epiphany  reading Malthus in October of     . There are passages where you can read it  and you think you're reading from a Darwin textbook  from the period before he has this epiphany. And so what you realize is that Darwin  in a sense  had the idea  he had the concept  but was unable of fully thinking it yet. And that is actually how great ideas often happen  they fade into view over long periods of time. Now the challenge for all of us is  how do you create environments that allow these ideas to have this kind of long half life  right  It's hard to go to your boss and say   I have an excellent idea for our organization. It will be useful in     . Could you just give me some time to do that   Now a couple of companies    like Google    they have innovation time off     percent time  where  in a sense  those are hunch cultivating mechanisms in an organization. But that's a key thing. And the other thing is to allow those hunches to connect with other people's hunches  that's what often happens. You have half of an idea  somebody else has the other half  and if you're in the right environment  they turn into something larger than the sum of their parts. So  in a sense  we often talk about the value of protecting intellectual property  you know  building barricades  having secretive R D labs  patenting everything that we have  so that those ideas will remain valuable  and people will be incentivized to come up with more ideas  and the culture will be more innovative. But I think there's a case to be made that we should spend at least as much time  if not more  valuing the premise of connecting ideas and not just protecting them. And I'll leave you with this story  which I think captures a lot of these values  and it's just wonderful kind of tale of innovation and how it happens in unlikely ways. It's October of       and Sputnik has just launched  and we're in Laurel Maryland  at the applied physics lab associated with Johns Hopkins University. And it's Monday morning  and the news has just broken about this satellite that's now orbiting the planet. And of course  this is nerd heaven  right  There are all these physics geeks who are there thinking   Oh my gosh  This is incredible. I can't believe this has happened.  And two of them  two    something researchers at the APL are there at the cafeteria table having an informal conversation with a bunch of their colleagues. And these two guys are named Guier and Weiffenbach. And they start talking  and one of them says   Hey  has anybody tried to listen for this thing  There's this  you know  man made satellite up there in outer space that's obviously broadcasting some kind of signal. We could probably hear it  if we tune in.  And so they ask around to a couple of their colleagues  and everybody's like   No  I hadn't thought of doing that. That's an interesting idea.  And it turns out Weiffenbach is kind of an expert in microwave reception  and he's got a little antennae set up with an amplifier in his office. And so Guier and Weiffenbach go back to Weiffenbach's office  and they start kind of noodling around    hacking  as we might call it now. And after a couple of hours  they actually start picking up the signal  because the Soviets made Sputnik very easy to track. It was right at    MHz  so you could pick it up really easily  because they were afraid that people would think it was a hoax  basically. So they made it really easy to find it. So these two guys are sitting there listening to this signal  and people start kind of coming into the office and saying   Wow  that's pretty cool. Can I hear  Wow  that's great.  And before long  they think   Well jeez  this is kind of historic. We may be the first people in the United States to be listening to this. We should record it.  And so they bring in this big  clunky analog tape recorder and they start recording these little bleep  bleeps. And they start writing the kind of date stamp  time stamps for each little bleep that they record. And they they start thinking   Well gosh  you know  we're noticing small little frequency variations here. We could probably calculate the speed that the satellite is traveling  if we do a little basic math here using the Doppler effect.  And then they played around with it a little bit more  and they talked to a couple of their colleagues who had other kind of specialties. And they said   Jeez  you know  we think we could actually take a look at the slope of the Doppler effect to figure out the points at which the satellite is closest to our antennae and the points at which it's farthest away. That's pretty cool.  And eventually  they get permission    this is all a little side project that hadn't been officially part of their job description. They get permission to use the new  you know  UNIVAC computer that takes up an entire room that they'd just gotten at the APL. They run some more of the numbers  and at the end of about three or four weeks  turns out they have mapped the exact trajectory of this satellite around the Earth  just from listening to this one little signal  going off on this little side hunch that they'd been inspired to do over lunch one morning. A couple weeks later their boss  Frank McClure  pulls them into the room and says   Hey  you guys  I have to ask you something about that project you were working on. You've figured out an unknown location of a satellite orbiting the planet from a known location on the ground. Could you go the other way  Could you figure out an unknown location on the ground  if you knew the location of the satellite   And they thought about it and they said   Well  I guess maybe you could. Let's run the numbers here.  So they went back  and they thought about it. And they came back and said   Actually  it'll be easier.  And he said   Oh  that's great. Because see  I have these new nuclear submarines that I'm building. And it's really hard to figure out how to get your missile so that it will land right on top of Moscow  if you don't know where the submarine is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. So we're thinking  we could throw up a bunch of satellites and use it to track our submarines and figure out their location in the middle of the ocean. Could you work on that problem   And that's how GPS was born.    years later  Ronald Reagan actually opened it up and made it an open platform that anybody could kind of build upon and anybody could come along and build new technology that would create and innovate on top of this open platform  left it open for anyone to do pretty much anything they wanted with it. And now  I guarantee you certainly half of this room  if not more  has a device sitting in their pocket right now that is talking to one of these satellites in outer space. And I bet you one of you  if not more  has used said device and said satellite system to locate a nearby coffeehouse somewhere in the last    in the last day or last week  right  And that  I think  is a great case study  a great lesson in the power  the marvelous  kind of unplanned emergent  unpredictable power of open innovative systems. When you build them right  they will be led to completely new directions that the creators never even dreamed of. I mean  here you have these guys who basically thought they were just following this hunch  this little passion that had developed  then they thought they were fighting the Cold War  and then it turns out they're just helping somebody find a soy latte. That is how innovation happens. Chance favors the connected mind. Thank you very much. I want you to take a trip with me. Picture yourself driving down a small road in Africa  and as you drive along  you look off to the side  and this is what you see  you see a field of graves. And you stop  and you get out of your car and you take a picture. And you go into the town  and you inquire   What's going on here   and people are initially reluctant to tell you. And then someone says   These are the recent AIDS deaths in our community.  HIV isn't like other medical conditions  it's stigmatizing. People are reluctant to talk about it    there's a fear associated with it. And I'm going to talk about HIV today  about the deaths  about the stigma. It's a medical story  but more than that  it's a social story. This map depicts the global distribution of HIV. And as you can see  Africa has a disproportionate share of the infection. There are    million people living with HIV in the world today. Of these  two thirds     million are living in sub Saharan Africa. There are  .  million pregnant women in low  and middle income countries living with HIV and of these     percent are in sub Saharan Africa. We talk about things in relative terms. And I'm going to talk about annual pregnancies and HIV positive mothers. The United States    a large country    each year        mothers with HIV who give birth to a child. But you go to Rwanda    a very small country          mothers with HIV who are pregnant. And then you go to Baragwanath Hospital  outside of Johannesburg in South Africa  and       HIV positive pregnant women giving birth    a hospital the same as a country. And to realize that this is just the tip of an iceberg that when you compare everything here to South Africa  it just pales  because in South Africa  each year         mothers with HIV give birth to children. So we talk about PMTCT  and we refer to PMTCT  prevention of mother to child transmission. I think there's an assumption amongst most people in the public that if a mother is HIV positive  she's going to infect her child. The reality is really  very different. In resource rich countries  with all the tests and treatment we currently have  less than two percent of babies are born HIV positive       percent of babies are born HIV negative. And yet  the reality in resource poor countries  in the absence of tests and treatment     percent       percent of children are infected       percent versus two percent    an enormous difference. So these programs    and I'm going to refer to PMTCT though my talk    these prevention programs  simply  they're the tests and the drugs that we give to mothers to prevent them from infecting their babies  and also the medicines we give to mothers to keep them healthy and alive to raise their children. So it's the test a mother gets when she comes in. It's the drugs she receives to protect the baby that's inside the uterus and during delivery. It's the guidance she gets around infant feeding and safer sex. It's an entire package of services  and it works. So in the United States  since the advent of treatment in the middle of the     s  there's been an    percent decline in the number of HIV infected children. Less than     babies are born with HIV each year in the United States and yet  still  over         children are born every year in the world today with HIV. What does that mean  It means       children infected each day          children each day  infected with HIV. And where do they come from  Well  less than one comes from the United States. One  on average  comes from Europe.     come from Asia and the Pacific. And each day  a thousand babies    a thousand babies are born each day with HIV in Africa. So again  I look at the globe here and the disproportionate share of HIV in Africa. And let's look at another map. And here  again  we see Africa has a disproportionate share of the numbers of doctors. That thin sliver you see here  that's Africa. And it's the same with nurses. The truth is sub Saharan Africa has    percent of the global disease burden and yet only three percent of the world's health care workers. That means doctors and nurses simply don't have the time to take care of patients. A nurse in a busy clinic will see    to     patients in a day  which leaves her just minutes per patient    minutes per patient. And so when we look at these PMTCT programs  what does it mean  Well  back in       when there was just a simple test and a single dose of a drug  a nurse  in the course of her few minutes with a patient  would have to counsel for the HIV test  perform the HIV test  explain the results  dispense a single dose of the drug  Nevirapine  explain how to take it  discuss infant feeding options  reinforce infant feeding  and test the baby    in minutes. Well  fortunately since       we've got new treatments  new tests  and we're far more successful  but we don't have any more nurses. And so these are the tests a nurse now has to do in those same few minutes. It's not possible    it doesn't work. And so we need to find better ways of providing care. This is a picture of a maternal health clinic in Africa    mothers coming  pregnant and with their babies. These women are here for care  but we know that just doing a test  just giving someone a drug  it's not enough. Meds don't equal medical care. Doctors and nurses  frankly  don't have the time or skills to tell people what to do in ways they understand. I'm a doctor    I tell people things to do  and I expect them to follow my guidance    because I'm a doctor  I went to Harvard    but the reality is  if I tell a patient   You should have safer sex. You should always use a condom   and yet  in her relationship  she's not empowered    what's going to happen  If I tell her to take her medicines every day and yet  no one in the household knows about her illness  so it's just not going to work. And so we need to do more  we need to do it differently  we need to do it in ways that are affordable and accessible and can be taken to scale  which means it can be done everywhere. So  I want to tell you a story    I want to take you on a little trip. Imagine yourself  if you can  you're a young woman in Africa  you're going to the hospital or clinic. You go in for a test and you find out that you're pregnant  and you're delighted. And then they give you another test and they tell you you're HIV positive  and you're devastated. And the nurse takes you into a room  and she tells you about the tests and HIV and the medicines you can take and how to take care of yourself and your baby  and you hear none of it. All you're hearing is   I'm going to die  and my baby is going to die.  And then you're out on the street  and you don't know where to go. And you don't know who you can talk to  because the truth is  HIV is so stigmatizing that if you partner  your family  anyone in your home  you're likely to be thrown out without any means of support. And this    this is the face and story of HIV in Africa today. But we're here to talk about possible solutions and some good news. And I want to change the story a little bit. Take the same mother  and the nurse  after she gives her her test  takes her to a room. The door opens and there's a room full of mothers  mothers with babies  and they're sitting  and they're talking  they're listening. They're drinking tea  they're having sandwiches. And she goes inside  and woman comes up to her and says   Welcome to mothers mothers. Have a seat. You're safe here. We're all HIV positive. You're going to be okay. You're going to live. Your baby is going to be HIV negative.  We view mothers as a community's single greatest resource. Mothers take care of the children  take care of the home. So often the men are gone. They're working  or they're not part of the household. Our organization  mothers mothers  enlists women with HIV as care providers. We bring mothers who have HIV  who've been through these PMTCT programs in the very facilities  to come back and work side by side with doctors and nurses as part of the health care team. These mothers  we call them mentor mothers  are able to engage women who  just like themselves  pregnant with babies  have found out about being HIV positive  who need support and education. And they support them around the diagnosis and educate them about how to take their medicines  how to take care of themselves  how to take care of their babies. Consider  if you needed surgery  you would want the best possible technical surgeon  right  But if you wanted to understand what that surgery would do to your life  you'd like to engage someone  someone who's had the procedure. Patients are experts on their own experience  and they can share that experience with others. This is the medical care that goes beyond just medicines. So the mothers who work for us  they come from the communities in which they work. They're hired    they're paid as professional members of the health care teams  just like doctors and nurses. And we open bank accounts for them and they're paid directly into the accounts  because their money's protected  the men can't take it away from them. They go through two to three weeks of rigorous curriculum based education  training. Now  doctors and nurses    they too get trained. But so often  they only get trained once  so they're not aware of new medicines  new guidelines as they come out. Our mentor mothers get trained every single year and retrained. And so doctors and nurses    they look up to them as experts. Imagine that  a woman  a former patient  being able to educate her doctor for the first time and educate the other patients that she's taking care of. Our organization has three goals. The first  to prevent mother to child transmission. The second  keep mothers healthy  keep mothers alive  keep the children alive    no more orphans. And the third  and maybe the most grand  is to find ways to empower women  enable them to fight the stigma and to live positive and productive lives with HIV. So how do we do it  Well  maybe the most important engagement is the one to one  seeing patients one to one  educating them  supporting them  explaining how they can take care of themselves. We go beyond that  we try to bring in the husbands  the partners. In Africa  it's very  very hard to engage men. Men are not frequently part of pregnancy care. But in Rwanda  in one country  they've got a policy that a woman can't come for care unless she brings the father of the baby with her    that's the rule. And so the father and the mother  together  go through the counseling and the testing. The father and the mother  together  they get the results. And this is so important in breaking through the stigma. Disclosure is so central to prevention. How do you have safer sex  how do you use a condom regularly if there hasn't been disclosure  Disclosure is so important to treatment  because again  people need the support of family members and friends to take their medicines regularly. We also work in groups. Now the groups  it's not like me lecturing  but what happens is women  they come together    under the support and guidance of our mentor mothers    they come together  and they share their personal experiences. And it's through the sharing that people get tactics of how to take care of themselves  how to disclose how to take medicines. And then there's the community outreach  engaging women in their communities. If we can change the way households believe and think  we can change the way communities believe and think. And if we can change enough communities  we can change national attitudes. We can change national attitudes to women and national attitudes to HIV. The hardest barrier really is around stigma reduction. We have the medicines  we have the tests  but how do you reduce the stigma  And it's important about disclosure. So  a couple years ago  one of the mentor mothers came back  and she told me a story. She had been asked by one of the clients to go to the home of the client  because the client wanted to tell the mother and her brothers and sisters about her HIV status  and she was afraid to go by herself. And so the mentor mother went along with. And the patient walked into the house and said to her mother and siblings   I have something to tell you. I'm HIV positive.  And everybody was quiet. And then her oldest brother stood up and said   I too have something to tell you. I'm HIV positive. I've been afraid to tell everybody.  And then this older sister stood up and said   I too am living with the virus  and I've been ashamed.  And then her younger brother stood up and said   I'm also positive. I thought you were going to throw me out of the family.  And you see where this is going. The last sister stood up and said   I'm also positive. I thought you were going to hate me.  And there they were  all of them together for the first time being able to share this experience for the first time and to support each other for the first time. and they are crying and scared. I tell them my story  that I am HIV positive  but my child is HIV negative. I tell them   You are going to make it  and you will raise a healthy baby.  I am proof that there is hope. Mitchell Besser  Remember the images I showed you of how few doctors and nurses there are in Africa. And it is a crisis in health care systems. Even as we have more tests and more drugs  we can't reach people  we don't have enough providers. So we talk in terms of what we call task shifting. Task shifting is traditionally when you take health care services from one provider and have another provider do it. Typically  it's a doctor giving a job to a nurse. And the issue in Africa is that there are fewer nurses  really than doctors  and so we need to find new paradigm for health care. How do you build a better health care system  We've chosen to redefine the health care system as a doctor  a nurse and a mentor mother. And so what nurses do is that they ask the mentor mothers to explain how to take the drugs  the side effects. They delegate education about infant feeding  family planning  safer sex  actions that nurses simple just don't have time for. So we go back to the prevention of mother to child transmission. The world is increasingly seeing these programs as the bridge to comprehensive maternal and child health. And our organization helps women across that bridge. The care doesn't stop when the baby's born    we deal with the ongoing health of the mother and baby  ensuring that they live healthy  successful lives. Our organization works on three levels. The first  at the patient level    mothers and babies keeping babies from getting HIV  keeping mothers healthy to raise them. The second  communities    empowering women. They become leaders within their communities. They change the way communities think    we need to change attitudes to HIV. We need to change attitudes to women in Africa. We have to do that. And then rework the level of the health care systems  building stronger health care systems. Our health care systems are broken. They're not going to work the way they're currently designed. And so doctors and nurses who need to try to change people's behaviors don't have the skills  don't have the time    our mentor mothers do. And so in redefining the health care teams by bringing the mentor mothers in  we can do that. I started the program in Capetown  South Africa back in     . It was at that point  just the spark of an idea. Referencing Steven Johnson's very lovely speech yesterday on where ideas come from  I was in the shower at the time    I was alone. The program is now working in nine countries  we have     program sites  we're seeing about         women every month  we're employing       mentor mothers  and last year  they enrolled         HIV positive pregnant women and mothers. That is    percent of the global HIV positive pregnant women       percent of the world. What's extraordinary is how simple the premise is. Mothers with HIV caring for mothers with HIV. Past patients taking care of present patients. And empowerment through employment    reducing stigma. hope that one day we shall win this fight against HIV and AIDS. Each person must know their HIV status. Those who are HIV negative must know how to stay negative. Those who are HIV infected must know how to take care of themselves. HIV positive pregnant women must get PMTCT services in order to have HIV negative babies. All of this is possible  if we each contribute to this fight. MB  Simple solutions to complex problems. Mothers caring for mothers. It's transformational. Thank you. I'm going to share with you the story as to how I have become an HIV AIDS campaigner. And this is the name of my campaign  SING Campaign. In November of       I was invited to take part in the launch of Nelson Mandela's       Foundation    that is his HIV AIDS foundation. And       is the number that Mandela had when he was imprisoned in Robben Island. And that's me with Youssou N'Dour  onstage  having the time of my life. The next day  all the artists were invited to join Mandela in Robben Island  where he was going to give a conference to the world's press  standing in front of his former prison cell. You can see the bars of the window there. It was quite a momentous occasion for all of us. In that moment in time  Mandela told the world's press that there was a virtual genocide taking place in his country  that post apartheid Rainbow Nation  a thousand people were dying on a daily basis and that the front line victims  the most vulnerable of all  were women and children. This was a huge impact on my mind  because I am a woman and I am a mother  and I hadn't realized that the HIV AIDS pandemic was directly affecting women in such a way. And so I committed    when I left South Africa  when I left Capetown  I told myself   This is going to be something that I have to talk about. I have to serve.  And so  subsequently I participated in every single       event that I could take part in and gave news conferences  interviews  talking and using my platform as a musician  with my commitment to Mandela    out of respect for the tremendous  unbelievable work that he had done. Everyone in the world respects Nelson Mandela  everyone reveres Nelson Mandela. But do they all know about what has been taking place in South Africa  his country  the country that had one of the highest incidents of transmission of the virus  I think that if I went out into the street now and I told people what was happening there  they would be shocked. I was very  very fortunate a couple of years later to have met Zackie Achmat  the founder of Treatment Action Campaign  an incredible campaigner and activist. I met him at a       event. He was wearing a t shirt like the one I wear now. This is a tool    this tells you I am in solidarity with people who have HIV  people who are living with HIV. And in a way because of the stigma  by wearing this t shirt I say   Yes  we can talk about this issue. It doesn't have to be in the closet.  I became a member of Treatment Action Campaign and I'm very proud to be a member of that incredible organization. It's a grassroots campaign with    percent membership being women  most of whom are HIV positive. They work in the field. They have tremendous outreach to the people who are living directly with the effects of the virus. They have education programs. They bring out the issues of stigma. It's quite extraordinary what they do. And yes  my SING Campaign has supported Treatment Action Campaign in the way that I have tried to raise awareness and to try to also raise funds. A lot of the funding that I have managed to raise has gone directly to Treatment Action Campaign and the incredible work that they do  and are still continuing to do in South Africa. So this is my SING Campaign. SING Campaign is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to support me. I've traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years    I went to about    different countries. Here I am in Oslo in Norway  getting a nice  fat check  singing in Hong Kong  trying to get people to raise money. In Johannesburg  I had the opportunity to play to a mainly white  middle class South African audience who ended up in tears because I use film clips that really touch the heart  the whole nature  of this terrible tragedy that is taking place  that people are tending to avoid  because they are fatigued  and they really don't quite know what the solutions are. Aaron Motsoaledi  the current health minister  attended that concert and I had an opportunity to meet with him  and he gave his absolute commitment to try to making a change  which is absolutely necessary. This is in the Scottish Parliament. I've subsequently become an envoy for Scotland and HIV. And I was showing them my experiences and trying to  again  raise awareness. And once again  in Edinburgh with the wonderful African Children's Choir who I simply adore. And it's children like this  many of whom have been orphaned because of their family being affected by the AIDS virus. I'm sitting here in New York with Michel Sidibe    he's the director of UNAIDS. And I'm very honored by the fact that Michel invited me  only a few months ago  to become a UNAIDS ambassador. And in this way  I've been strengthening my platform and broadening my outreach. The message that UNAIDS are currently sending out to the world is that we would like to see the virtual elimination of the transmission of the virus from mother to child by     . It's a very ambitious goal but we believe it can be achieved with political will. This can happen. And here I am with a pregnant woman  who is HIV positive and we're smiling  both of us are smiling  because we're very confident  because we know that that young woman is receiving treatment so her life can be extended to take care of the baby she's about to give birth to. And her baby will receive PMTCT  which will mean that that baby can be born free of the virus. Now that is prevention at the very beginning of life. It's one way to start looking at intervention with the AIDS pandemic. Now  I just would like to finish off to tell you the little story about Avelile. This is Avelile    she goes with me wherever I go. I tell her story to everyone because she represents one of millions of HIV AIDS orphans. Avelile's mother had HIV virus    she died from AIDS related illness. Avelile had the virus  she was born with the virus. And here she is at seven years old  weighing no more than a one year old baby. At this point in her life  she's suffering with full blown AIDS and had pneumonia. We met her in a hospital in the Eastern Cape and spent a whole afternoon with her    an adorable child. The doctors and nurses were phenomenal. They put her on very special nutritious diet and took great care of her. And we didn't know when we left the hospital    because we filmed her story    we didn't know if she was going to survive. So  it was obviously    it was a very emotional encounter and left us feeling very resonant with this direct experience  this one child  you know  that story. Five months later  we went back to South Africa to meet Avelile again. And I'm getting    the hairs on my    I don't know if you can see the hairs on my arms. They're standing up because I know what I'm going to show you. This is the transformation that took place. Isn't it extraordinary  That round of applause is actually for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of Avelile. And I take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation. So  I would like to say to you  each one in the audience  if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have access to good nutrition and good medical care  and you believe that the Millennium Development Goals  specifically five and six  should be absolutely committed to by all governments around the world    especially in sub Saharan Africa    could you please stand up. I think that's fair to say  it's almost everyone in the hall. Thank you very much. I am a Ph.D. student and that means I have a question  how can we make digital content graspable  Because you see  on the one hand  there is the digital world and no question  many things are happening there right now. And for us humans  it's not quite material  it's not really there    it's virtual. On the other hand  we humans  we live in a physical world. It's rich  it tastes good  it feels good  it smells good. So the question is  how do we get the stuff over from the digital into the physical  That's my question. If you look at the iPhone with its touch and the Wii with its bodily activity  you can see the tendency  it's getting physical. The question is  what's next  Now  I have three options that I would like to show you. The first one is mass. As humans  we are sensitive to where an object in our hand is heavy. So  could we use that in mobile phones  Let me show you the weight shifting mobile. It is a mobile phone shaped box that has an iron weight inside  which we can move around  and you can feel where it's heavy. We shift the gravitational center of it. For example  we can augment digital content with physical mass. So you move around the content on a display  but you can also feel where it is just from the weight of the device. Another thing it's good for is navigation    it can guide you around in a city. It can tell you by its weight   Okay  move right. Walk ahead. Make a left here.  And the good thing about that is you don't have to look at the device all the time  you have your eyes free to see the city. Now  mass is the first thing  the second thing  that's shape. We're also sensitive to the shape of objects we have in  our  hands. So if I download an e book and it has    pages    well  they could be thin  right    but if it has     pages  I want to feel that  Harry Potter     it's thick.  Laughter  So let me show you the shape changing mobile. Again  it's a mobile phone shaped box  and this one can change its shape. We can play with the shape itself. For example  it can be thin in your pocket  which we of course want it to be  but then if you hold it in your hand  it can lean towards you  be thick. It's like tapered to the downside. If you change the grasp  it can adjust to that. It's also useful if you want to put it down on your nightstand to watch a movie or use as an alarm clock  it stands. It's fairly simple. Another thing is  sometimes we watch things on a mobile phone  they are bigger than the phone itself. So in that case    like here  there's an app that's bigger than the phone's screen    the shape of the phone could tell you   Okay  off the screen right here  there is more content. You can't see it  but it's there.  And you can feel that because it's thicker at that edge. The shape is the second thing. The third thing operates on a different level. As humans  we are social  we are empathic  and that's great. Wouldn't that be a way to make mobile phones more intuitive  Think of a hamster in the pocket. Well  I can feel it  it's doing all right    I don't have to check it. Let me show you the living mobile phone. So  once again  mobile phone shaped box  but this one  it has a breath and a heartbeat  and it feels very organic. And you can tell  it's relaxed right now. Oh now  missed call  a new call  new girlfriend maybe    very exciting.  Laughter  How do we calm it down  You give it a pat behind the ears  and everything is all right again. So  that's very intuitive  and that's what we want. So  what we have seen are three ways to make the digital graspable for us. And I think making it physical is a good way to do that. What's behind that is a postulation  namely that not humans should get much more technical in the future  rather than that  technology  a bit more human. The Hindus say   Nada brahma   one translation of which is   The world is sound.  And in a way  that's true  because everything is vibrating. In fact  all of you as you sit here right now are vibrating. Every part of your body is vibrating at different frequencies. So you are  in fact  a chord    each of you an individual chord. One definition of health may be that that chord is in complete harmony. Your ears can't hear that chord  they can actually hear amazing things. Your ears can hear    octaves. Incidentally  we see just one octave. Your ears are always on    you have no ear lids. They work even when you sleep. The smallest sound you can perceive moves your eardrum just four atomic diameters. The loudest sound you can hear is a trillion times more powerful than that. Ears are made not for hearing  but for listening. Listening is an active skill  whereas hearing is passive  listening is something that we have to work at    it's a relationship with sound. And yet it's a skill that none of us are taught. For example  have you ever considered that there are listening positions  places you can listen from  Here are two of them. Reductive listening is listening  for.  It reduces everything down to what's relevant and it discards everything that's not relevant. Men typically listen reductively. So he's saying   I've got this problem.  He's saying   Here's your solution. Thanks very much. Next.  That's the way we talk  right guys  Expansive listening  on the other hand  is listening  with   not listening  for.  It's got no destination in mind    it's just enjoying the journey. Women typically listen expansively. If you look at these two  eye contact  facing each other  possibly both talking at the same time. Men  if you get nothing else out of this talk  practice expansive listening  and you can transform your relationships. The trouble with listening is that so much of what we hear is noise  surrounding us all the time. Noise like this  according to the European Union  is reducing the health and the quality of life of    percent of the population of Europe. Two percent of the population of Europe    that's    million people    are having their sleep devastated by noise like that. Noise kills         people a year in Europe. It's a really big problem. Now  when you were little  if you had noise and you didn't want to hear it  you'd stick your fingers in your ears and hum. These days  you can do a similar thing  it just looks a bit cooler. It looks a bit like this. The trouble with widespread headphone use is it brings three really big health issues. The first really big health issue is a word that Murray Schafer coined   schizophonia.  It's a dislocation between what you see and what you hear. So  we're inviting into our lives the voices of people who are not present with us. I think there's something deeply unhealthy about living all the time in schizophonia. The second problem that comes with headphone abuse is compression. We squash music to fit it into our pocket and there is a cost attached to this. Listen to this    this is an uncompressed piece of music. And now the same piece of music with    percent of the data removed. I do hope that some of you at least can hear the difference between those two. There is a cost of compression. It makes you tired and irritable to have to make up all of that data. You're having to imagine it. It's not good for you in the long run. The third problem with headphones is this  deafness    noise induced hearing disorder. Ten million Americans already have this for one reason or another  but really worryingly     percent    roughly one in six    of American teenagers suffer from noise induced hearing disorder as a result of headphone abuse. One study at an American university found that    percent of college freshmen had damaged hearing as a result of headphone abuse. We may be raising an entire generation of deaf people. Now that's a really serious problem. I'll give you three quick tips to protect your ears and pass these on to your children  please. Professional hearing protectors are great  I use some all the time. If you're going to use headphones  buy the best ones you can afford because quality means you don't have to have it so loud. If you can't hear somebody talking to you in a loud voice  it's too loud. And thirdly  if you're in bad sound  it's fine to put your fingers in your ears or just move away from it. Protect your ears in that way. Let's move away from bad sound and look at some friends that I urge you to seek out. WWB  Wind  water  birds    stochastic natural sounds composed of lots of individual random events  all of it very healthy  all of it sound that we evolved to over the years. Seek those sounds out  they're good for you and so it this. Silence is beautiful. The Elizabethans described language as decorated silence. I urge you to move away from silence with intention and to design soundscapes just like works of art. Have a foreground  a background  all in beautiful proportion. It's fun to get into designing with sound. If you can't do it yourself  get a professional to do it for you. Sound design is the future  and I think it's the way we're going to change the way the world sounds. I'm going to just run quickly through eight modalities  eight ways sound can improve health. First  ultrasound  we're very familiar with it from physical therapy  it's also now being used to treat cancer. Lithotripsy    saving thousands of people a year from the scalpel by pulverizing stones with high intensity sound. Sound healing is a wonderful modality. It's been around for thousands of years. I do urge you to explore this. There are great things being done there  treating now autism  dementia and other conditions. And music  of course. Just listening to music is good for you  if it's music that's made with good intention  made with love  generally. Devotional music  good    Mozart  good. There are all sorts of types of music that are very healthy. And four modalities where you need to take some action and get involved. First of all  listen consciously. I hope that that after this talk you'll be doing that. It's a whole new dimension to your life and it's wonderful to have that dimension. Secondly  get in touch with making some sound    create sound. The voice is the instrument we all play  and yet how many of us are trained in using our voice  Get trained  learn to sing  learn to play an instrument. Musicians have bigger brains    it's true. You can do this in groups as well. It's a fantastic antidote to schizophonia  to make music and sound in a group of people  whichever style you enjoy particularly. And let's take a stewarding role for the sound around us. Protect your ears  Yes  absolutely. Design soundscapes to be beautiful around you at home and at work. And let's start to speak up when people are assailing us with the noise that I played you early on. So I'm going to leave you with seven things you can do right now to improve your health with sound. My vision is of a world that sounds beautiful and if we all start doing these things  we will take a very big step in that direction. So I urge you to take that path. I'm leaving you with a little more birdsong  which is very good for you. I wish you sound health. I got up this morning at      a.m. after going to sleep at       a.m. I was awakened once during the night. My heart rate was    beats per minute    my blood pressure      over   . I had zero minutes of exercise yesterday  so my maximum heart rate during exercise wasn't calculated. I had about     milligrams of caffeine  zero of alcohol. And my score on the Narcissism Personality Index  or the NPI     is a reassuring  .  . We know that numbers are useful for us when we advertise  manage  govern  search. I'm going to talk about how they're useful when we reflect  learn  remember and want to improve. A few years ago  Kevin Kelly  my partner  and I noticed that people were subjecting themselves to regimes of quantitative measurement and self tracking that went far beyond the ordinary  familiar habits such as stepping on a scale every day. People were tracking their food via Twitter  their kids' diapers on their iPhone. They were making detailed journals of their spending  their mood  their symptoms  their treatments. Now  we know some of the technological facts that are driving this change in our lifestyle    the uptake and diffusion of mobile devices  the exponential improvement in data storage and data processing  and the remarkable improvement in human biometric sensors. This little black dot there is a  D accelerometer. It tracks your movement through space. It is  as you can see  very small and also very cheap. They're now down to well under a dollar a piece  and they're going into all kinds of devices. But what's interesting is the incredible detailed information that you can get from just one sensor like this. This kind of sensor is in the hit biometric device    among early adopters at the moment    the Fitbit. This tracks your activity and also your sleep. It has just that sensor in it. You're probably familiar with the Nike  system. I just put it up because that little blue dot is the sensor. It's really just a pressure sensor like the kind that's in a doorbell. And Nike knows how to get your pace and distance from just that sensor. This is the strap that people use to transmit heart rate data to their Nike  system. This is a beautiful  new device that gives you detailed sleep tracking data  not just whether you're asleep or awake  but also your phase of sleep    deep sleep  light sleep  REM sleep. The sensor is just a little strip of metal in that headband there. The rest of it is the bedside console  just for reference  this is a sleep tracking system from just a few years ago    I mean  really until now. And this is the sleep tracking system of today. This just was presented at a health care conference in D.C. Most of what you see there is an asthma inhaler  but the top is a very small GPS transceiver  which gives you the date and location of an asthma incident  giving you a new awareness of your vulnerability in relation to time and environmental factors. Now  we know that new tools are changing our sense of self in the world    these tiny sensors that gather data in nature  the ubiquitous computing that allows that data to be understood and used  and of course the social networks that allow people to collaborate and contribute. But we think of these tools as pointing outward  as windows and I'd just like to invite you to think of them as also turning inward and becoming mirrors. So that when we think about using them to get some systematic improvement  we also think about how they can be useful for self improvement  for self discovery  self awareness  self knowledge. Here's a biometric device  a pair of Apple Earbuds. Last year  Apple filed some patents to get blood oxygenation  heart rate and body temperature via the Earbuds. What is this for  What should it be for  Some people will say it's for biometric security. Some people will say it's for public health research. Some people will say it's for avant garde marketing research. I'd like to tell you that it's also for self knowledge. And the self isn't the only thing  it's not even most things. The self is just our operation center  our consciousness  our moral compass. So  if we want to act more effectively in the world  we have to get to know ourselves better. Thank you. We live in in a remarkable time  the age of genomics. Your genome is the entire sequence of your DNA. Your sequence and mine are slightly different. That's why we look different. I've got brown eyes  you might have blue or gray. But it's not just skin deep. The headlines tell us that genes can give us scary diseases  maybe even shape our personality  or give us mental disorders. Our genes seem to have awesome power over our destinies. And yet  I would like to think that I am more than my genes. What do you guys think  Are you more than your genes  I think some people agree with me. I think we should make a statement. I think we should say it all together. All right   I'm more than my genes     all together. Everybody  I am more than my genes. Sebastian Seung  What am I  I am my connectome. Now  since you guys are really great  maybe you can humor me and say this all together too. Right. All together now. Everybody  I am my connectome. SS  That sounded great. You know  you guys are so great  you don't even know what a connectome is  and you're willing to play along with me. I could just go home now. Well  so far only one connectome is known  that of this tiny worm. Its modest nervous system consists of just     neurons. And in the     s and '  s  a team of scientists mapped all       connections between the neurons. In this diagram  every node is a neuron  and every line is a connection. This is the connectome of the worm C. elegans. Your connectome is far more complex than this because your brain contains     billion neurons and        times as many connections. There's a diagram like this for your brain  but there's no way it would fit on this slide. Your connectome contains one million times more connections than your genome has letters. That's a lot of information. What's in that information  We don't know for sure  but there are theories. Since the   th century  neuroscientists have speculated that maybe your memories    the information that makes you  you    maybe your memories are stored in the connections between your brain's neurons. And perhaps other aspects of your personal identity    maybe your personality and your intellect    maybe they're also encoded in the connections between your neurons. And so now you can see why I proposed this hypothesis  I am my connectome. I didn't ask you to chant it because it's true  I just want you to remember it. And in fact  we don't know if this hypothesis is correct  because we have never had technologies powerful enough to test it. Finding that worm connectome took over a dozen years of tedious labor. And to find the connectomes of brains more like our own  we need more sophisticated technologies  that are automated  that will speed up the process of finding connectomes. And in the next few minutes  I'll tell you about some of these technologies  which are currently under development in my lab and the labs of my collaborators. Now you've probably seen pictures of neurons before. You can recognize them instantly by their fantastic shapes. They extend long and delicate branches  and in short  they look like trees. But this is just a single neuron. In order to find connectomes  we have to see all the neurons at the same time. So let's meet Bobby Kasthuri  who works in the laboratory of Jeff Lichtman at Harvard University. Bobby is holding fantastically thin slices of a mouse brain. And we're zooming in by a factor of         times to obtain the resolution  so that we can see the branches of neurons all at the same time. Except  you still may not really recognize them  and that's because we have to work in three dimensions. If we take many images of many slices of the brain and stack them up  we get a three dimensional image. And still  you may not see the branches. So we start at the top  and we color in the cross section of one branch in red  and we do that for the next slice and for the next slice. And we keep on doing that  slice after slice. If we continue through the entire stack  we can reconstruct the three dimensional shape of a small fragment of a branch of a neuron. And we can do that for another neuron in green. And you can see that the green neuron touches the red neuron at two locations  and these are what are called synapses. Let's zoom in on one synapse  and keep your eyes on the interior of the green neuron. You should see small circles    these are called vesicles. They contain a molecule know as a neurotransmitter. And so when the green neuron wants to communicate  it wants to send a message to the red neuron  it spits out neurotransmitter. At the synapse  the two neurons are said to be connected like two friends talking on the telephone. So you see how to find a synapse. How can we find an entire connectome  Well  we take this three dimensional stack of images and treat it as a gigantic three dimensional coloring book. We color every neuron in  in a different color  and then we look through all of the images  find the synapses and note the colors of the two neurons involved in each synapse. If we can do that throughout all the images  we could find a connectome. Now  at this point  you've learned the basics of neurons and synapses. And so I think we're ready to tackle one of the most important questions in neuroscience  how are the brains of men and women different  According to this self help book  guys brains are like waffles  they keep their lives compartmentalized in boxes. Girls' brains are like spaghetti  everything in their life is connected to everything else. You guys are laughing  but you know  this book changed my life. But seriously  what's wrong with this  You already know enough to tell me    what's wrong with this statement  It doesn't matter whether you're a guy or girl  everyone's brains are like spaghetti. Or maybe really  really fine capellini with branches. Just as one strand of spaghetti contacts many other strands on your plate  one neuron touches many other neurons through their entangled branches. One neuron can be connected to so many other neurons  because there can be synapses at these points of contact. By now  you might have sort of lost perspective on how large this cube of brain tissue actually is. And so let's do a series of comparisons to show you. I assure you  this is very tiny. It's just six microns on a side. So  here's how it stacks up against an entire neuron. And you can tell that  really  only the smallest fragments of branches are contained inside this cube. And a neuron  well  that's smaller than brain. And that's just a mouse brain    it's a lot smaller than a human brain. So when show my friends this  sometimes they've told me   You know  Sebastian  you should just give up. Neuroscience is hopeless.  Because if you look at a brain with your naked eye  you don't really see how complex it is  but when you use a microscope  finally the hidden complexity is revealed. In the   th century  the mathematician and philosopher  Blaise Pascal  wrote of his dread of the infinite  his feeling of insignificance at contemplating the vast reaches of outer space. And  as a scientist  I'm not supposed to talk about my feelings    too much information  professor. But may I  I feel curiosity  and I feel wonder  but at times I have also felt despair. Why did I choose to study this organ that is so awesome in its complexity that it might well be infinite  It's absurd. How could we even dare to think that we might ever understand this  And yet  I persist in this quixotic endeavor. And indeed  these days I harbor new hopes. Someday  a fleet of microscopes will capture every neuron and every synapse in a vast database of images. And some day  artificially intelligent supercomputers will analyze the images without human assistance to summarize them in a connectome. I do not know  but I hope that I will live to see that day  because finding an entire human connectome is one of the greatest technological challenges of all time. It will take the work of generations to succeed. At the present time  my collaborators and I  what we're aiming for is much more modest    just to find partial connectomes of tiny chunks of mouse and human brain. But even that will be enough for the first tests of this hypothesis that I am my connectome. For now  let me try to convince you of the plausibility of this hypothesis  that it's actually worth taking seriously. As you grow during childhood and age during adulthood  your personal identity changes slowly. Likewise  every connectome changes over time. What kinds of changes happen  Well  neurons  like trees  can grow new branches  and they can lose old ones. Synapses can be created  and they can be eliminated. And synapses can grow larger  and they can grow smaller. Second question  what causes these changes  Well  it's true. To some extent  they are programmed by your genes. But that's not the whole story  because there are signals  electrical signals  that travel along the branches of neurons and chemical signals that jump across from branch to branch. These signals are called neural activity. And there's a lot of evidence that neural activity is encoding our thoughts  feelings and perceptions  our mental experiences. And there's a lot of evidence that neural activity can cause your connections to change. And if you put those two facts together  it means that your experiences can change your connectome. And that's why every connectome is unique  even those of genetically identical twins. The connectome is where nature meets nurture. And it might true that just the mere act of thinking can change your connectome    an idea that you may find empowering. What's in this picture  A cool and refreshing stream of water  you say. What else is in this picture  Do not forget that groove in the Earth called the stream bed. Without it  the water would not know in which direction to flow. And with the stream  I would like to propose a metaphor for the relationship between neural activity and connectivity. Neural activity is constantly changing. It's like the water of the stream  it never sits still. The connections of the brain's neural network determines the pathways along which neural activity flows. And so the connectome is like bed of the stream  but the metaphor is richer than that  because it's true that the stream bed guides the flow of the water  but over long timescales  the water also reshapes the bed of the stream. And as I told you just now  neural activity can change the connectome. And if you'll allow me to ascend to metaphorical heights  I will remind you that neural activity is the physical basis    or so neuroscientists think    of thoughts  feelings and perceptions. And so we might even speak of the stream of consciousness. Neural activity is its water  and the connectome is its bed. So let's return from the heights of metaphor and return to science. Suppose our technologies for finding connectomes actually work. How will we go about testing the hypothesis  I am my connectome   Well  I propose a direct test. Let us attempt to read out memories from connectomes. Consider the memory of long temporal sequences of movements  like a pianist playing a Beethoven sonata. According to a theory that dates back to the   th century  such memories are stored as chains of synaptic connections inside your brain. Because  if the first neurons in the chain are activated  through their synapses they send messages to the second neurons  which are activated  and so on down the line  like a chain of falling dominoes. And this sequence of neural activation is hypothesized to be the neural basis of those sequence of movements. So one way of trying to test the theory is to look for such chains inside connectomes. But it won't be easy  because they're not going to look like this. They're going to be scrambled up. So we'll have to use our computers to try to unscramble the chain. And if we can do that  the sequence of the neurons we recover from that unscrambling will be a prediction of the pattern of neural activity that is replayed in the brain during memory recall. And if that were successful  that would be the first example of reading a memory from a connectome. What a mess    have you ever tried to wire up a system as complex as this  I hope not. But if you have  you know it's very easy to make a mistake. The branches of neurons are like the wires of the brain. Can anyone guess  what's the total length of wires in your brain  I'll give you a hint. It's a big number. I estimate  millions of miles  all packed in your skull. And if you appreciate that number  you can easily see there is huge potential for mis wiring of the brain. And indeed  the popular press loves headlines like   Anorexic brains are wired differently   or  Autistic brains are wired differently.  These are plausible claims  but in truth  we can't see the brain's wiring clearly enough to tell if these are really true. And so the technologies for seeing connectomes will allow us to finally read mis wiring of the brain  to see mental disorders in connectomes. Sometimes the best way to test a hypothesis is to consider its most extreme implication. Philosophers know this game very well. If you believe that I am my connectome  I think you must also accept the idea that death is the destruction of your connectome. I mention this because there are prophets today who claim that technology will fundamentally alter the human condition and perhaps even transform the human species. One of their most cherished dreams is to cheat death by that practice known as cryonics. If you pay         dollars  you can arrange to have your body frozen after death and stored in liquid nitrogen in one of these tanks in an Arizona warehouse  awaiting a future civilization that is advanced to resurrect you. Should we ridicule the modern seekers of immortality  calling them fools  Or will they someday chuckle over our graves  I don't know    I prefer to test their beliefs  scientifically. I propose that we attempt to find a connectome of a frozen brain. We know that damage to the brain occurs after death and during freezing. The question is  has that damage erased the connectome  If it has  there is no way that any future civilization will be able to recover the memories of these frozen brains. Resurrection might succeed for the body  but not for the mind. On the other hand  if the connectome is still intact  we cannot ridicule the claims of cryonics so easily. I've described a quest that begins in the world of the very small  and propels us to the world of the far future. Connectomes will mark a turning point in human history. As we evolved from our ape like ancestors on the African savanna  what distinguished us was our larger brains. We have used our brains to fashion ever more amazing technologies. Eventually  these technologies will become so powerful that we will use them to know ourselves by deconstructing and reconstructing our own brains. I believe that this voyage of self discovery is not just for scientists  but for all of us. And I'm grateful for the opportunity to share this voyage with you today. Thank you. So I want to tell you a story    an encouraging story    about addressing desperation  depression and despair in Afghanistan  and what we have learned from it  and how to help people to overcome traumatic experiences and how to help them to regain some confidence in the time ahead    in the future    and how to participate again in everyday life. So  I am a Jungian psychoanalyst  and I went to Afghanistan in January       by chance  on an assignment for Medica Mondiale. Jung in Afghanistan    you get the picture. Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world  and    percent of the people are illiterate. War and malnutrition kills people together with hope. You may know this from the media  but what you may not know is that the average age of the Afghan people is    years old  which means they grow up in such an environment and    I repeat myself    in    years of war. So this translates into ongoing violence  foreign interests  bribery  drugs  ethnic conflicts  bad health  shame  fear and cumulative traumatic experiences. Local and foreign military are supposed to build peace together with the donors and the governmental and non governmental organizations. And people had hope  yes  but until they realized their situation worsens every day    either because they are being killed or because  somehow  they are poorer than eight years ago. One figure for that     percent of the children under the age of five years suffer from malnutrition. Yet  there is hope. One day a man told me   My future does not look brilliant  but I want to have a brilliant future for my son.  This is a picture I took in       walking on Fridays over the hills in Kabul  and for me it's a symbolic picture of an open future for a young generation. So  doctors prescribe medication. And donors are supposed to bring peace by building schools and roads. Military collect weapons  and depression stays intact. Why  Because people don't have tools to cope with it  to get over it. So  soon after my arrival  I had confirmed something which I had already known  that my instruments come from the heart of modern Europe  yes. However  what can wound us and our reaction to those wounds    they are universal. And the big challenge was how to understand the meaning of the symptom in this specific cultural context. After a counseling session  a woman said to me   Because you have felt me  I can feel myself again  and I want to participate again in my family life.  This was very important  because the family is central in Afghans' social system. No one can survive alone. And if people feel used  worthless and ashamed  because something horrible has happened to them  then they retreat  and they fall into social isolation  and they do not dare to tell this evil to other people or to their loved ones  because they do not want to burden them. And very often violence is a way to cope with it. Traumatized people also easily lose control    symptoms are hyper arousal and memory flashbacks    so people are in a constant fear that those horrible feelings of that traumatic event might come back unexpectedly  suddenly  and they cannot control it. To compensate this loss of inner control  they try to control the outside  very understandably    mostly the family    and unfortunately  this fits very well into the traditional side  regressive side  repressive side  restrictive side of the cultural context. So  husbands start beating wives  mothers and fathers beat their children  and afterward  they feel awful. They did not want to do this  it just happened    they lost control. The desperate try to restore order and normality  and if we are not able to cut this circle of violence  it will be transferred to the next generation without a doubt. And partly this is already happening. So everybody needs a sense for the future  and the Afghan sense of the future is shattered. But let me repeat the words of the woman.  Because you have felt me  I can feel myself again.  So the key here is empathy. Somebody has to be a witness to what has happened to you. Somebody has to feel how you felt. And somebody has to see you and listen to you. Everybody must be able to know what he or she has experienced is true  and this only goes with another person. So everybody must be able to say   This happened to me  and it did this with me  but I'm able to live with it  to cope with it  and to learn from it. And I want to engage myself in the bright future for my children and the children of my children  and I will not marry off my    year old daughter      what happens too often in Afghanistan. So something can be done  even in such extreme environments as Afghanistan. And I started thinking about a counseling program. But  of course  I needed help and funds. And one evening  I was sitting next to a very nice gentleman in Kabul  and he asked what I thought would be good in Afghanistan. And I explained to him quickly  I would train psycho social counselors  I would open centers  and I explained to him why. This man gave me his contact details at the end of the evening and said   If you want to do this  call me.  At that time  it was the head of Caritas Germany. So  I was able to launch a three year project with Caritas Germany  and we trained    Afghan women and men  and we opened    counseling centers in Kabul. This was our sign    it's hand painted  and we had    all over Kabul. Eleven thousand people came    more than that. And    percent regained their lives. This was a very exciting time  developing this with my wonderful Afghan team. And they are working with me up to today. We developed a culturally sensitive psycho social counseling approach. So  from      up until today  a substantial change and step forward has been taking place. The European Union delegation in Kabul came into this and hired me to work inside the Ministry of Public Health  to lobby this approach    we succeeded. We revised the mental health component of the primary health care services by adding psycho social care and psycho social counselors to the system. This means  certainly  to retrain all health staff. But for that  we already have the training manuals  which are approved by the Ministry and moreover  this approach is now part of the mental health strategy in Afghanistan. So we also have implemented it already in some selected clinics in three provinces  and you are the first to see the results. We wanted to know if what is being done is effective. And here you can see the patients all had symptoms of depression  moderate and severe. And the red line is the treatment as usual    medication with a medical doctor. And all the symptoms stayed the same or even got worse. And the green line is treatment with psycho social counseling only  without medication. And you can see the symptoms almost completely go away  and the psycho social stress has dropped significantly  which is explicable  because you cannot take away the psycho social stresses  but you can learn how to cope with them. So this makes us very happy  because now we also have some evidence that this is working. So here you see  this is a health facility in Northern Afghanistan  and every morning it looks like this all over. And doctors usually have three to six minutes for the patients  but now this will change. They go to the clinics  because they want to cure their immediate symptoms  and they will find somebody to talk to and discuss these issues and talk about what is burdening them and find solutions  develop their resources  learn tools to solve their family conflicts and gain some confidence in the future. And I would like to share one short vignette. One Hazara said to his Pashtun counselor   If we were to have met some years ago  then we would have killed each other. And now you are helping me to regain some confidence in the future.  And another counselor said to me after the training   You know  I never knew why I survived the killings in my village  but now I know  because I am part of a nucleus of a new peaceful society in Afghanistan.  So I believe this kept me running. And this is a really emancipatory and political contribution to peace and reconciliation. And also    I think    without psycho social therapy  and without considering this in all humanitarian projects  we cannot build up civil societies. I thought it was an idea worth spreading  and I think it must be  can be  could be replicated elsewhere. I thank you for your attention. Welcome to Thailand. Now  when I was a young man       years ago  the country was very  very poor with lots and lots and lots of people living in poverty. We decided to do something about it  but we didn't begin with a welfare program or a poverty reduction program. But we began with a family planning program  following a very successful maternal child health activity  sets of activities. So basically  no one would accept family planning if their children didn't survive. So the first step  get to the children  get to the mothers  and then follow up with family planning. Not just child mortality alone  you need also family planning. Now let me take you back as to why we needed to do it. In my country  that was the case in     . Seven children per family    tremendous growth at  .  percent. There was just no future. We needed to reduce the population growth rate. So we said   Let's do it.  The women said   We agree. We'll use pills  but we need a doctor to prescribe the pills   and we had very  very few doctors. We didn't take no as an answer  we took no as a question. We went to the nurses and the midwives  who were also women  and did a fantastic job at explaining how to use the pill. That was wonderful  but it covered only    percent of the country. What do we do for the other    percent    leave them alone and say   Well  they're not medical personnel.  No  we decided to do a bit more. So we went to the ordinary people that you saw. Actually  below that yellow sign    I wish they hadn't wiped that  because there was  Coca Cola  there. We were so much bigger than Coca Cola in those days. And no difference  the people they chose were the people we chose. They were well known in the community  they knew that customers were always right  and they were terrific  and they practiced their family planning themselves. So they could supply pills and condoms throughout the country  in every village of the country. So there we are. We went to the people who were seen as the cause of the problem to be the solution. Wherever there were people    and you can see boats with the women  selling things    here's the floating market selling bananas and crabs and also contraceptives    wherever you find people  you'll find contraceptives in Thailand. And then we decided  why not get to religion because in the Philippines  the Catholic Church was pretty strong  and Thai people were Buddhist. We went to them and they said   Look  could you help us   I'm there    the one in blue  not the yellow    holding a bowl of holy water for the monk to sprinkle holy water on pills and condoms for the sanctity of the family. And this picture was sent throughout the country. So some of the monks in the villages were doing the same thing themselves. And the women were saying   No wonder we have no side effects. It's been blessed.  That was their perception. And then we went to teachers. You need everybody to be involved in trying to provide whatever it is that make humanity a better place. So we went to the teachers. Over a quarter of a million were taught about family planning with a new alphabet    A  B for birth  C for condom  I for IUD  V for vasectomy. And then we had a snakes and ladders game  where you throw dice. If you land on anything pro family planning  you move ahead. Like   Mother takes the pill every night. Very good  mother. Move ahead. Uncle buys a condom. Very good  uncle. Move ahead. Uncle gets drunk  doesn't use condom. Come back  start again.  Again  education  class entertainment. And the kids were doing it in school too. We had relay races with condoms  we had children's condom blowing championship. And before long  the condom was know as the girl's best friend. In Thailand  for poor people  diamonds don't make it    so the condom is the girl's best friend. We introduced our first microcredit program in       and the women who organized it said   We only want to lend to women who practice family planning. If you're pregnant  take care of your pregnancy. If you're not pregnant  you can take a loan out from us.  And that was run by them. And after       years  it's still going on. It's a part of the Village Development Bank  it's not a real bank  but it's a fund    microcredit. And we didn't need a big organization to run it    it was run by the villagers themselves. And you probably hardly see a Thai man there  it's always women  women  women  women. And then we thought we'd help America  because America's been helping everyone  whether they want help or not. And this is on the Fourth of July. We decided to provide vasectomy to all men  but in particular  American men to the front of the queue  right up to the Ambassador's residence during his  unclear . And the hotel gave us the ballroom for it    very appropriate room. And since it was near lunch time  they said   All right  we'll give you some lunch. Of course  it must be American cola. You get two brands  Coke and Pepsi. And then the food is either hamburger or hotdog.  And I thought a hotdog will be more symbolic. And here is this  then  young man called Willy Bohm who worked for the USAID. Obviously  he's had his vasectomy because his hotdog is half eaten  and he was very happy. It made a lot of news in America  and it angered some people also. I said   Don't worry. Come over and I'll do the whole lot of you.  And what happened  In all this thing  from seven children to  .  children  population growth rate of  .  to  . . You could call it the Coca Cola approach if you like    it was exactly the same thing. I'm not sure whether Coca Cola followed us  or we followed Coca Cola  but we're good friends. And so that's the case of everyone joining in. We didn't have a strong government. We didn't have lots of doctors. But it's everybody's job who can change attitude and behavior. Then AIDS came along and hit Thailand  and we had to stop doing a lot of good things to fight AIDS. But unfortunately  the government was in denial  denial  denial. So our work wasn't affected. So I thought   Well  if you can't go to the government  go to the military.  So I went to the military and asked to borrow     radio stations. They have more than the government  and they've got more guns than the government. So I asked them  could they help us in our fight against HIV. And after I gave them statistics  they said   Yes. Okay. You can use all the radio stations  television stations.  And that's when we went onto the airwaves. And then we got a new prime minister soon after that. And he said   Mechai  could you come and join   He asked me in because he liked my wife a lot. So I said   Okay.  He became the chairman of the National AIDS Committee and increased the budget fifty fold. Every ministry  even judges  had to be involved in AIDS education    everyone    and we said the public  institutions  religious institutions  schools    everyone was involved. And here  every media person had to be trained for HIV. And we gave every station half a minute extra for advertising to earn more money. So they were happy with that. And then AIDS education in all schools  starting from university. And these are high school kids teaching high school kids. And the best teachers were the girls  not the boys  and they were terrific. And these girls who go around teaching about safe sex and HIV were known as Mother Theresa. And then we went down one more step. These are primary school kids    third  fourth grade    going to every household in the village  every household in the whole of Thailand  giving AIDS information and a condom to every household  given by these young kids. And no parents objected  because we were trying to save lives  and this was a lifesaver. And we said   Everyone needs to be involved.  So you have the companies also realizing that sick staff don't work  and dead customers don't buy. So they all trained. And then we have this Captain Condom  with his Harvard MBA  going to schools and night spots. And they loved him. You need a symbol of something. In every country  every program  you need a symbol  and this is probably the best thing he's ever done with his MBA. And then we gave condoms out everywhere on the streets    everywhere  everywhere. In taxis  you get condoms. And also  in traffic  the policemen give you condoms    our  cops and rubbers  programs. So  can you imagine New York policemen giving out condoms  Of course I can. And they'd enjoy it immensely  I see them standing around right now  everywhere. Imagine if they had condoms  giving out to all sorts of people. And then  new change  we had hair bands  clothing and the condom for your mobile phone during the rainy season. And these were the condoms that we introduced. One says   Weapon of mass protection.  We found    you know    somebody here was searching for the weapon of mass destruction  but we have found the weapon of mass protection  the condom. And then it says here  with the American flag   Don't leave home without it.  But I have some to give out afterward. But let me warn you  these are Thai sized  so be very careful. And so you can see that condoms can do so many things. Look at this    I gave this to Al Gore and to Bill Senior also. Stop global warming  use condoms. And then this is the picture I mentioned to you    the weapon of mass protection. And let the next Olympics save some lives. Why just run around  And then finally  in Thailand we're Buddhist  we don't have a God  so instead  we say   In rubber we trust.  So you can see that we added everything to our endeavor to make life better for the people. We had condoms in all the refrigerators in the hotels and the schools  because alcohol impairs judgment. And then what happened  After all this time  everybody joined in. According to the U.N.  new cases of HIV declined by    percent  and according to the World Bank   .  million lives were saved. Otherwise there wouldn't be many Thais walking around today. So it just showed you  you could do something about it.    percent of the funding came from Thailand. There was political commitment  some financial commitment  and everybody joined in the fight. So just don't leave it to the specialists and doctors and nurses. We all need to help. And then we decided to help people out of poverty  now that we got AIDS somewhat out of the way    this time  not with government alone  but in cooperation with the business community. Because poor people are business people who lack business skills and access to credit. Those are the things to be provided by the business community. We're trying to turn them into barefoot entrepreneurs  little business people. The only way out of poverty is through business enterprise. So  that was done. The money goes from the company into the village via tree planting. It's not a free gift. They plant the trees  and the money goes into their microcredit fund  which we call the Village Development Bank. Everybody joins in  and they feel they own the bank  because they have brought the money in. And before you can borrow the money  you need to be trained. And we believe if you want to help the poor  those who are living in poverty  access to credit must be a human right. Access to credit must be a human right. Otherwise they'll never get out of poverty. And then before getting a loan  you must be trained. Here's what we call a  barefoot MBA   teaching people how to do business so that  when they borrow money  they'll succeed with the business. These are some of the businesses  mushrooms  crabs  vegetables  trees  fruits  and this is very interesting    Nike ice cream and Nike biscuits  this is a village sponsored by Nike. They said   They should stop making shoes and clothes. Make these better  because we can afford them.  And then we have silk  Thai silk. Now we're making Scottish tartans  as you can see on the left  to sell to all people of Scottish ancestors. So anyone sitting in and watching TV  get in touch with me. And then this is our answer to Starbucks in Thailand     Coffee and Condoms.  See  Starbucks you awake  we keep you awake and alive. That's the difference. Can you imagine  at every Starbucks that you can also get condoms  You can order your condoms with your with your cappuccino. And then now  finally in education  we want to change the school as being underutilized into a place where it's a lifelong learning center for everyone. We call this our School Based Integrated Rural Development. And it's a center  a focal point for economic and social development. Re do the school  make it serve the community needs. And here is a bamboo building    all of them are bamboo. This is a geodesic dome made of bamboo. And I'm sure Buckminster Fuller would be very  very proud to see a bamboo geodesic dome. And we use vegetables around the school ground  so they raise their own vegetables. And then  finally  I firmly believe  if we want the MDGs to work    the Millennium Development Goals    we need to add family planning to it. Of course  child mortality first and then family planning    everyone needs family planning service    it's underutilized. So we have now found the weapon of mass protection. And we also ask the next Olympics to be involved in saving lives. And then  finally  that is our network. And these are our Thai tulips. Thank you very much indeed. So  I'd like to spend a few minutes with you folks today imagining what our planet might look like in a thousand years. But before I do that  I need to talk to you about synthetic materials like plastics  which require huge amounts of energy to create and  because of their disposal issues  are slowly poisoning our planet. I also want to tell you and share with you how my team and I have been using mushrooms over the last three years. Not like that.  Laughter  We're using mushrooms to create an entirely new class of materials  which perform a lot like plastics during their use  but are made from crop waste and are totally compostable at the end of their lives. But first  I need to talk to you about what I consider one of the most egregious offenders in the disposable plastics category. This is a material you all know is Styrofoam  but I like to think of it as toxic white stuff. In a single cubic foot of this material    about what would come around your computer or large television    you have the same energy content of about a liter and a half of petrol. Yet  after just a few weeks of use  you'll throw this material in the trash. And this isn't just found in packaging.    billion dollars of this material is produced every year  in everything from building materials to surfboards to coffee cups to table tops. And that's not the only place it's found. The EPA estimates  in the United States  by volume  this material occupies    percent of our landfills. Even worse is when it finds its way into our natural environment    on the side of the road or next to a river. If it's not picked up by a human  like me and you  it'll stay there for thousands and thousands of years. Perhaps even worse is when it finds its way into our oceans  like in the great plastic gyre  where these materials are being mechanically broken into smaller and smaller bits  but they're not really going away. They're not biologically compatible. They're basically fouling up Earth's respiratory and circulatory systems. And because these materials are so prolific  because they're found in so many places  there's one other place you'll find this material  styrene  which is made from benzene  a known carcinogen. You'll find it inside of you. So  for all these reasons  I think we need better materials  and there are three key principles we can use to guide these materials. The first is feedstocks. Today  we use a single feedstock  petroleum  to heat our homes  power our cars and make most of the materials you see around you. We recognize this is a finite resource  and it's simply crazy to do this  to put a liter and a half of petrol in the trash every time you get a package. Second of all  we should really strive to use far less energy in creating these materials. I say far less  because    percent isn't going to cut it. We should be talking about half  a quarter  one tenth the energy content. And lastly  and I think perhaps most importantly  we should be creating materials that fit into what I call nature's recycling system. This recycling system has been in place for the last billion years. I fit into it  you fit into it  and a hundred years tops  my body can return to the Earth with no preprocessing. Yet that packaging I got in the mail yesterday is going to last for thousands of years. This is crazy. But nature provides us with a really good model here. When a tree's done using its leaves    its solar collectors  these amazing molecular photon capturing devices    at the end of a season  it doesn't pack them up  take them to the leaf reprocessing center and have them melted down to form new leaves. It just drops them  the shortest distance possible  to the forest floor  where they're actually upcycled into next year's topsoil. And this gets us back to the mushrooms. Because in nature  mushrooms are the recycling system. And what we've discovered is  by using a part of the mushroom you've probably never seen    analogous to its root structure  it's called mycelium    we can actually grow materials with many of the same properties of conventional synthetics. Now  mycelium is an amazing material  because it's a self assembling material. It actually takes things we would consider waste    things like seed husks or woody biomass    and can transform them into a chitinous polymer  which you can form into almost any shape. In our process  we basically use it as a glue. And by using mycelium as a glue  you can mold things just like you do in the plastic industry  and you can create materials with many different properties  materials that are insulating  fire resistant  moisture resistant  vapor resistant    materials that can absorb impacts  that can absorb acoustical impacts. But these materials are grown from agricultural byproducts  not petroleum. And because they're made of natural materials  they are     percent compostable in you own backyard. So I'd like to share with you the four basic steps required to make these materials. The first is selecting a feedstock  preferably something that's regional  that's in your area  right    local manufacturing. The next is actually taking this feedstock and putting in a tool  physically filling an enclosure  a mold  in whatever shape you want to get. Then you actually grow the mycelium through these particles  and that's where the magic happens  because the organism is doing the work in this process  not the equipment. The final step is  of course  the product  whether it's a packaging material  a table top  or building block. Our vision is local manufacturing  like the local food movement  for production. So we've created formulations for all around the world using regional byproducts. If you're in China  you might use a rice husk or a cottonseed hull. If you're in Northern Europe or North America  you can use things like buckwheat husks or oat hulls. We then process these husks with some basic equipment. And I want to share with you a quick video from our facility that gives you a sense of how this looks at scale. So what you're seeing here is actually cotton hulls from Texas  in this case. It's a waste product. And what they're doing in our equipment is going through a continuous system  which cleans  cooks  cools and pasteurizes these materials  while also continuously inoculating them with our mycelium. This gives us a continuous stream of material that we can put into almost any shape  though today we're making corner blocks. And it's when this lid goes on the part  that the magic really starts. Because the manufacturing process is our organism. It'll actually begin to digest these wastes and  over the next five days  assemble them into biocomposites. Our entire facility is comprised of thousands and thousands and thousands of these tools sitting indoors in the dark  quietly self assembling materials    and everything from building materials to  in this case  a packaging corner block. So I've said a number of times that we grow materials. And it's kind of hard to picture how that happens. So my team has taken five days worth of growth  a typical growth cycle for us  and condensed it into a    second time lapse. And I want you to really watch closely these little white dots on the screen  because  over the five day period  what they do is extend out and through this material  using the energy that's contained in these seed husks to build this chitinous polymer matrix. This matrix self assembles  growing through and around the particles  making millions and millions of tiny fibers. And what parts of the seed husk we don't digest  actually become part of the final  physical composite. So in front of your eyes  this part just self assembled. It actually takes a little longer. It takes five days. But it's much faster than conventional farming. The last step  of course  is application. In this case  we've grown a corner block. A major Fortune     furniture maker uses these corner blocks to protect their tables in shipment. They used to use a plastic packaging buffer  but we were able to give them the exact same physical performance with our grown material. Best of all  when it gets to the customer  it's not trash. They can actually put this in their natural ecosystem without any processing  and it's going to improve the local soil. So  why mycelium  The first reason is local open feedstocks. You want to be able to do this anywhere in the world and not worry about peak rice hull or peak cottonseed hulls  because you have multiple choices. The next is self assembly  because the organism is actually doing most of the work in this process. You don't need a lot of equipment to set up a production facility. So you can have lots of small facilities spread all across the world. Biological yield is really important. And because     percent of what we put in the tool become the final product  even the parts that aren't digested become part of the structure  we're getting incredible yield rates. Natural polymers  well ... I think that's what's most important  because these polymers have been tried and tested in our ecosystem for the last billion years  in everything from mushrooms to crustaceans. They're not going to clog up Earth's ecosystems. They work great. And while  today  we can practically guarantee that yesterday's packaging is going to be here in        years  what I want to guarantee is that in        years  our descendants  our children's children  will be living happily and in harmony with a healthy Earth. And I think that can be some really good news. Thank you. I want to talk to you today about prosperity  about our hopes for a shared and lasting prosperity. And not just us  but the two billion people worldwide who are still chronically undernourished. And hope actually is at the heart of this. In fact  the Latin word for hope is at the heart of the word prosperity.  Pro speras    speras   hope    in accordance with our hopes and expectations. The irony is  though  that we have cashed out prosperity almost literally in terms of money and economic growth. And we've grown our economies so much that we now stand in a real danger of undermining hope    running down resources  cutting down rainforests  spilling oil into the Gulf of Mexico  changing the climate    and the only thing that has actually remotely slowed down the relentless rise of carbon emissions over the last two to three decades is recession. And recession  of course  isn't exactly a recipe for hope either  as we're busy finding out. So we're caught in a kind of trap. It's a dilemma  a dilemma of growth. We can't live with it  we can't live without it. Trash the system or crash the planet    it's a tough choice  it isn't much of a choice. And our best avenue of escape from this actually is a kind of blind faith in our own cleverness and technology and efficiency and doing things more efficiently. Now I haven't got anything against efficiency. And I think we are a clever species sometimes. But I think we should also just check the numbers  take a reality check here. So I want you to imagine a world  in       of around nine billion people  all aspiring to Western incomes  Western lifestyles. And I want to ask the question    and we'll give them that two percent hike in income  in salary each year as well  because we believe in growth. And I want to ask the question  how far and how fast would be have to move  How clever would we have to be  How much technology would we need in this world to deliver our carbon targets  And here in my chart    on the left hand side is where we are now. This is the carbon intensity of economic growth in the economy at the moment. It's around about     grams of carbon. In the world I describe to you  we have to be right over here at the right hand side at six grams of carbon. It's a     fold improvement  and that is    times further and faster than anything we've ever achieved in industrial history. Maybe we can do it  maybe it's possible    who knows  Maybe we can even go further and get an economy that pulls carbon out of the atmosphere  which is what we're going to need to be doing by the end of the century. But shouldn't we just check first that the economic system that we have is remotely capable of delivering this kind of improvement  So I want to just spend a couple of minutes on system dynamics. It's a bit complex  and I apologize for that. What I'll try and do  is I'll try and paraphrase it is sort of human terms. So it looks a little bit like this. Firms produce goods for households    that's us    and provide us with incomes  and that's even better  because we can spend those incomes on more goods and services. That's called the circular flow of the economy. It looks harmless enough. I just want to highlight one key feature of this system  which is the role of investment. Now investment constitutes only about a fifth of the national income in most modern economies  but it plays an absolutely vital role. And what it does essentially is to stimulate further consumption growth. It does this in a couple of ways    chasing productivity  which drives down prices and encourages us to buy more stuff. But I want to concentrate on the role of investment in seeking out novelty  the production and consumption of novelty. Joseph Schumpeter called this  the process of creative destruction.  It's a process of the production and reproduction of novelty  continually chasing expanding consumer markets  consumer goods  new consumer goods. And this  this is where it gets interesting  because it turns out that human beings have something of an appetite for novelty. We love new stuff    new material stuff for sure    but also new ideas  new adventures  new experiences. But the materiality matters too  because in every society that anthropologists have looked at  material stuff operates as a kind of language    a language of goods  a symbolic language that we use to tell each other stories    stories  for example  about how important we are. Status driven  conspicuous consumption thrives from the language of novelty. And here  all of a sudden  we have a system that is locking economic structure with social logic    the economic institutions  and who we are as people  locked together to drive an engine of growth. And this engine is not just economic value  it is pulling material resources relentlessly through the system  driven by our own insatiable appetites  driven in fact by a sense of anxiety. Adam Smith      years ago  spoke about our desire for a life without shame. A life without shame  in his day  what that meant was a linen shirt  and today  well  you still need the shirt  but you need the hybrid car  the HDTV  two holidays a year in the sun  the netbook and iPad  the list goes on    an almost inexhaustible supply of goods  driven by this anxiety. And even if we don't want them  we need to buy them  because  if we don't buy them  the system crashes. And to stop it crashing over the last two to three decades  we've expanded the money supply  expanded credit and debt  so that people can keep buying stuff. And of course  that expansion was deeply implicated in the crisis. But this    I just want to show you some data here. This is what it looks like  essentially  this credit and debt system  just for the U.K. This was the last    years before the crash  and you can see there  consumer debt rose dramatically. It was above the GDP for three years in a row just before the crisis. And in the mean time  personal savings absolutely plummeted. The savings ratio  net savings  were below zero in the middle of       just before the crash. This is people expanding debt  drawing down their savings  just to stay in the game. This is a strange  rather perverse  story  just to put it in very simple terms. It's a story about us  people  being persuaded to spend money we don't have on things we don't need to create impressions that won't last on people we don't care about. But before we consign ourselves to despair  maybe we should just go back and say   Did we get this right  Is this really how people are  Is this really how economies behave   And almost straightaway we actually run up against a couple of anomalies. The first one is in the crisis itself. In the crisis  in the recession  what do people want to do  They want to hunker down  they want to look to the future. They want to spend less and save more. But saving is exactly the wrong thing to do from the system point of view. Keynes called this the  paradox of thrift     saving slows down recovery. And politicians call on us continually to draw down more debt  to draw down our own savings even further  just so that we can get the show back on the road  so we can keep this growth based economy going. It's an anomaly  it's a place where the system actually is at odds with who we are as people. Here's another one    completely different one  Why is it that we don't do the blindingly obvious things we should do to combat climate change  very  very simple things like buying energy efficient appliances  putting in efficient lights  turning the lights off occasionally  insulating our homes  These things save carbon  they save energy  they save us money. So is it that  though they make perfect economic sense  we don't do them  Well  I had my own personal insight into this a few years ago. It was a Sunday evening  Sunday afternoon  and it was just after    actually  to be honest  too long after    we had moved into a new house. And I had finally got around to doing some draft stripping  installing insulation around the windows and doors to keep out the drafts. And my  then  five year old daughter was helping me in the way that five year olds do. And we'd been doing this for a while  when she turned to me very solemnly and said   Will this really keep out the giraffes    Here they are  the giraffes.  You can hear the five year old mind working. These ones  interestingly  are     miles north of here outside Barrow in Furness in Cumbria. Goodness knows what they make of the Lake District weather. But actually that childish misrepresentation stuck with me  because it suddenly became clear to me why we don't do the blindingly obvious things. We're too busy keeping out the giraffes    putting the kids on the bus in the morning  getting ourselves to work on time  surviving email overload and shop floor politics  foraging for groceries  throwing together meals  escaping for a couple of precious hours in the evening into prime time TV or TED online  getting from one end of the day to the other  keeping out the giraffes. What is the objective   What is the objective of the consumer   Mary Douglas asked in an essay on poverty written    years ago.  It is   she said   to help create the social world and find a credible place in it.  That is a deeply humanizing vision of our lives  and it's a completely different vision than the one that lies at the heart of this economic model. So who are we  Who are these people  Are we these novelty seeking  hedonistic  selfish individuals  Or might we actually occasionally be something like the selfless altruist depicted in Rembrandt's lovely  lovely sketch here  Well psychology actually says there is a tension    a tension between self regarding behaviors and other regarding behaviors. And these tensions have deep evolutionary roots  so selfish behavior is adaptive in certain circumstances    fight or flight. But other regarding behaviors are essential to our evolution as social beings. And perhaps even more interesting from our point of view  another tension between novelty seeking behaviors and tradition or conservation. Novelty is adaptive when things are changing and you need to adapt yourself. Tradition is essential to lay down the stability to raise families and form cohesive social groups. So here  all of a sudden  we're looking at a map of the human heart. And it reveals to us  suddenly  the crux of the matter. What we've done is we've created economies. We've created systems  which systematically privilege  encourage  one narrow quadrant of the human soul and left the others unregarded. And in the same token  the solution becomes clear  because this isn't  therefore  about changing human nature. It isn't  in fact  about curtailing possibilities. It is about opening up. It is about allowing ourselves the freedom to become fully human  recognizing the depth and the breadth of the human psyche and building institutions to protect Rembrandt's fragile altruist within. What does all this mean for economics  What would economies look like if we took that vision of human nature at their heart and stretched them along these orthogonal dimensions of the human psyche  Well  it might look a little bit like the       community interest companies that have sprung up in the U.K. over the last five years and a similar rise in B corporations in the United States  enterprises that have ecological and social goals written into their constitution at their heart    companies  in fact  like this one  Ecosia. And I just want to  very quickly  show you this. Ecosia is an Internet search engine. Internet search engines work by drawing revenues from sponsored links that appear when you do a search. And Ecosia works in pretty much the same way. So we can do that here    we can just put in a little search term. There you go  Oxford  that's where we are. See what comes up. The difference with Ecosia though is that  in Ecosia's case  it draws the revenues in the same way  but it allocates    percent of those revenues to a rainforest protection project in the Amazon. And we're going to do it. We're just going to click on Naturejobs.uk. In case anyone out there is looking for a job in a recession  that's the page to go to. And what happened then was the sponsor gave revenues to Ecosia  and Ecosia is giving    percent of those revenues to a rainforest protection project. It's taking profits from one place and allocating them into the protection of ecological resources. It's a different kind of enterprise for a new economy. It's a form  if you like  of ecological altruism    perhaps something along those lines. Maybe it's that. Whatever it is  whatever this new economy is  what we need the economy to do  in fact  is to put investment back into the heart of the model  to re conceive investment. Only now  investment isn't going to be about the relentless and mindless pursuit of consumption growth. Investment has to be a different beast. Investment has to be  in the new economy  protecting and nurturing the ecological assets on which our future depends. It has to be about transition. It has to be investing in low carbon technologies and infrastructures. We have to invest  in fact  in the idea of a meaningful prosperity  providing capabilities for people to flourish. And of course  this task has material dimensions. It would be nonsense to talk about people flourishing if they didn't have food  clothing and shelter. But it's also clear that prosperity goes beyond this. It has social and psychological aims    family  friendship  commitments  society  participating in the life of that society. And this too requires investment  investment    for example  in places    places where we can connect  places where we can participate  shared spaces  concert halls  gardens  public parks  libraries  museums  quiet centers  places of joy and celebration  places of tranquility and contemplation  sites for the  cultivation of a common citizenship   in Michael Sandel's lovely phrase. An investment    investment  after all  is just such a basic economic concept    is nothing more nor less than a relationship between the present and the future  a shared present and a common future. And we need that relationship to reflect  to reclaim hope. So let me come back  with this sense of hope  to the two billion people still trying to live each day on less than the price of a skinny latte from the cafe next door. What can we offer those people  It's clear that we have a responsibility to help lift them out of poverty. It's clear that we have a responsibility to make room for growth where growth really matters in those poorest nations. And it's also clear that we will never achieve that unless we're capable of redefining a meaningful sense of prosperity in the richer nations  a prosperity that is more meaningful and less materialistic than the growth based model. So this is not just a Western post materialist fantasy. In fact  an African philosopher wrote to me  when  Prosperity Without Growth  was published  pointing out the similarities between this view of prosperity and the traditional African concept of ubuntu. Ubuntu says   I am because we are.  Prosperity is a shared endeavor. Its roots are long and deep    its foundations  I've tried to show  exist already  inside each of us. So this is not about standing in the way of development. It's not about overthrowing capitalism. It's not about trying to change human nature. What we're doing here is we're taking a few simple steps towards an economics fit for purpose. And at the heart of that economics  we're placing a more credible  more robust  and more realistic vision of what it means to be human. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  While they're taking the podium away  just a quick question. First of all  economists aren't supposed to be inspiring  so you may need to work on the tone a little. Can you picture the politicians ever buying into this  I mean  can you picture a politician standing up in Britain and saying   GDP fell two percent this year. Good news  We're actually all happier  and a country's more beautiful  and our lives are better.  Tim Jackson  Well that's clearly not what you're doing. You're not making news out of things falling down. You're making news out of the things that tell you that we're flourishing. Can I picture politicians doing it  Actually  I already am seeing a little bit of it. When we first started this kind of work  politicians would stand up  treasury spokesmen would stand up  and accuse us of wanting to go back and live in caves. And actually in the period through which we've been working over the last    years    partly because of the financial crisis and a little bit of humility in the profession of economics    actually people are engaging in this issue in all sorts of countries around the world. CA  But is it mainly politicians who are going to have to get their act together  or is it going to be more just civil society and companies  TJ  It has to be companies. It has to be civil society. But it has to have political leadership. This is a kind of agenda  which actually politicians themselves are kind of caught in that dilemma  because they're hooked on the growth model themselves. But actually opening up the space to think about different ways of governing  different kinds of politics  and creating the space for civil society and businesses to operate differently    absolutely vital. CA  And if someone could convince you that we actually can make the    what was it     the     fold improvement in efficiency  of reduction of carbon footprint  would you then actually like that picture of economic growth into more knowledge based goods  TJ  I would still want to know that you could do that and get below zero by the end of the century  in terms of taking carbon out of the atmosphere  and solve the problem of biodiversity and reduce the impact on land use and do something about the erosion of topsoils and the quality of water. If you can convince me we can do all that  then  yes  I would take the two percent. CA  Tim  thank you for a very important talk. Thank you. I've been fascinated for a lifetime by the beauty  form and function of giant bluefin tuna. Bluefin are warmblooded like us. They're the largest of the tunas  the second largest fish in the sea    bony fish. They actually are a fish that is endothermic    powers through the ocean with warm muscles like a mammal. That's one of our bluefin at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. You can see in its shape and its streamlined design it's powered for ocean swimming. It flies through the ocean on its pectoral fins  gets lift  powers its movements with a lunate tail. It's actually got a naked skin for most of its body  so it reduces friction with the water. This is what one of nature's finest machines. Now  bluefin were revered by Man for all of human history. For       years  we fished sustainably for this animal  and it's evidenced in the art that we see from thousands of years ago. Bluefin are in cave paintings in France. They're on coins that date back       years. This fish was revered by humankind. It was fished sustainably till all of time  except for our generation. Bluefin are pursued wherever they go    there is a gold rush on Earth  and this is a gold rush for bluefin. There are traps that fish sustainably up until recently. And yet  the type of fishing going on today  with pens  with enormous stakes  is really wiping bluefin ecologically off the planet. Now bluefin  in general  goes to one place  Japan. Some of you may be guilty of having contributed to the demise of bluefin. They're delectable muscle  rich in fat    absolutely taste delicious. And that's their problem  we're eating them to death. Now in the Atlantic  the story is pretty simple. Bluefin have two populations  one large  one small. The North American population is fished at about       ton. The European population and North African    the Eastern bluefin tuna    is fished at tremendous levels         tons over the last decade almost every year. The result is whether you're looking at the West or the Eastern bluefin population  there's been tremendous decline on both sides  as much as    percent if you go back with your baseline to     . For that  bluefin have been given a status equivalent to tigers  to lions  to certain African elephants and to pandas. These fish have been proposed for an endangered species listing in the past two months. They were voted on and rejected just two weeks ago  despite outstanding science that shows from two committees this fish meets the criteria of CITES I. And if it's tunas you don't care about  perhaps you might be interested that international long lines and pursing chase down tunas and bycatch animals such as leatherbacks  sharks  marlin  albatross. These animals and their demise occurs in the tuna fisheries. The challenge we face is that we know very little about tuna  and everyone in the room knows what it looks like when an African lion takes down its prey. I doubt anyone has seen a giant bluefin feed. This tuna symbolizes what's the problem for all of us in the room. It's the   st century  but we really have only just begun to really study our oceans in a deep way. Technology has come of age that's allowing us to see the Earth from space and go deep into the seas remotely. And we've got to use these technologies immediately to get a better understanding of how our ocean realm works. Most of us from the ship    even I    look out at the ocean and see this homogeneous sea. We don't know where the structure is. We can't tell where are the watering holes like we can on an African plain. We can't see the corridors  and we can't see what it is that brings together a tuna  a leatherback and an albatross. We're only just beginning to understand how the physical oceanography and the biological oceanography come together to create a seasonal force that actually causes the upwelling that might make a hot spot a hope spot. The reasons these challenges are great is that technically it's difficult to go to sea. It's hard to study a bluefin on its turf  the entire Pacific realm. It's really tough to get up close and personal with a mako shark and try to put a tag on it. And then imagine being Bruce Mate's team from OSU  getting up close to a blue whale and fixing a tag on the blue whale that stays  an engineering challenge we've yet to really overcome. So the story of our team  a dedicated team  is fish and chips. We basically are taking the same satellite phone parts  or the same parts that are in your computer  chips. We're putting them together in unusual ways  and this is taking us into the ocean realm like never before. And for the first time  we're able to watch the journey of a tuna beneath the ocean using light and photons to measure sunrise and sunset. Now  I've been working with tunas for over    years. I have the privilege of being a partner with the Monterey Bay Aquarium. We've actually taken a sliver of the ocean  put it behind glass  and we together have put bluefin tuna and yellowfin tuna on display. When the veil of bubbles lifts every morning  we can actually see a community from the Pelagic ocean  one of the only places on Earth you can see giant bluefin swim by. We can see in their beauty of form and function  their ceaseless activity. They're flying through their space  ocean space. And we can bring two million people a year into contact with this fish and show them its beauty. Behind the scenes is a working lab at Stanford University partnered with the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Here  for over    or    years  we've actually brought in both bluefin and yellowfin in captivity. We'd been studying these fish  but first we had to learn how to husbandry them. What do they like to eat  What is it that they're happy with  We go in the tanks with the tuna    we touch their naked skin    it's pretty amazing. It feels wonderful. And then  better yet  we've got our own version of tuna whisperers  our own Chuck Farwell  Alex Norton  who can take a big tuna and in one motion  put it into an envelope of water  so that we can actually work with the tuna and learn the techniques it takes to not injure this fish who never sees a boundary in the open sea. Jeff and Jason there  are scientists who are going to take a tuna and put it in the equivalent of a treadmill  a flume. And that tuna thinks it's going to Japan  but it's staying in place. We're actually measuring its oxygen consumption  its energy consumption. We're taking this data and building better models. And when I see that tuna    this is my favorite view    I begin to wonder  how did this fish solve the longitude problem before we did  So take a look at that animal. That's the closest you'll probably ever get. Now  the activities from the lab have taught us now how to go out in the open ocean. So in a program called Tag A Giant we've actually gone from Ireland to Canada  from Corsica to Spain. We've fished with many nations around the world in an effort to basically put electronic computers inside giant tunas. We've actually tagged       tunas. And I'm going to show you three clips  because I tagged       tunas. It's a very hard process  but it's a ballet. We bring the tuna out  we measure it. A team of fishers  captains  scientists and technicians work together to keep this animal out of the ocean for about four to five minutes. We put water over its gills  give it oxygen. And then with a lot of effort  after tagging  putting in the computer  making sure the stalk is sticking out so it senses the environment  we send this fish back into the sea. And when it goes  we're always happy. We see a flick of the tail. And from our data that gets collected  when that tag comes back  because a fisher returns it for a thousand dollar reward  we can get tracks beneath the sea for up to five years now  on a backboned animal. Now sometimes the tunas are really large  such as this fish off Nantucket. But that's about half the size of the biggest tuna we've ever tagged. It takes a human effort  a team effort  to bring the fish in. In this case  what we're going to do is put a pop up satellite archival tag on the tuna. This tag rides on the tuna  senses the environment around the tuna and actually will come off the fish  detach  float to the surface and send back to Earth orbiting satellites position data estimated by math on the tag  pressure data and temperature data. And so what we get then from the pop up satellite tag is we get away from having to have a human interaction to recapture the tag. Both the electronic tags I'm talking about are expensive. These tags have been engineered by a variety of teams in North America. They are some of our finest instruments  our new technology in the ocean today. One community in general has given more to help us than any other community. And that's the fisheries off the state of North Carolina. There are two villages  Harris and Morehead City  every winter for over a decade  held a party called Tag A Giant  and together  fishers worked with us to tag     to     fish. In this case  we're actually going to measure the fish. We're going to do something that in recent years we've started  take a mucus sample. Watch how shiny the skin is  you can see my reflection there. And from that mucus  we can get gene profiles  we can get information on gender  checking the pop up tag one more time  and then it's out in the ocean. And this is my favorite. With the help of my former postdoc  Gareth Lawson  this is a gorgeous picture of a single tuna. This tuna is actually moving on a numerical ocean. The warm is the Gulf Stream  the cold up there in the Gulf of Maine. That's where the tuna wants to go    it wants to forage on schools of herring    but it can't get there. It's too cold. But then it warms up  and the tuna pops in  gets some fish  maybe comes back to home base  goes in again and then comes back to winter down there in North Carolina and then on to the Bahamas. And my favorite scene  three tunas going into the Gulf of Mexico. Three tunas tagged. Astronomically  we're calculating positions. They're coming together. That could be tuna sex    and there it is. That is where the tuna spawn. So from data like this  we're able now to put the map up  and in this map you see thousands of positions generated by this decade and a half of tagging. And now we're showing that tunas on the western side go to the eastern side. So two populations of tunas    that is  we have a Gulf population  one that we can tag    they go to the Gulf of Mexico  I showed you that    and a second population. Living amongst our tunas    our North American tunas    are European tunas that go back to the Med. On the hot spots    the hope spots    they're mixed populations. And so what we've done with the science is we're showing the International Commission  building new models  showing them that a two stock no mixing model    to this day  used to reject the CITES treaty    that model isn't the right model. This model  a model of overlap  is the way to move forward. So we can then predict where management places should be. Places like the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean are places where the single species  the single population  can be captured. These become forthright in places we need to protect. The center of the Atlantic where the mixing is  I could imagine a policy that lets Canada and America fish  because they manage their fisheries well  they're doing a good job. But in the international realm  where fishing and overfishing has really gone wild  these are the places that we have to make hope spots in. That's the size they have to be to protect the bluefin tuna. Now in a second project called Tagging of Pacific Pelagics  we took on the planet as a team  those of us in the Census of Marine Life. And  funded primarily through Sloan Foundation and others  we were able to actually go in  in our project    we're one of    field programs and begin to take on tagging large numbers of predators  not just tunas. So what we've done is actually gone up to tag salmon shark in Alaska  met salmon shark on their home territory  followed them catching salmon and then went in and figured out that  if we take a salmon and put it on a line  we can actually take up a salmon shark    This is the cousin of the white shark    and very carefully    note  I say  very carefully      we can actually keep it calm  put a hose in its mouth  keep it off the deck and then tag it with a satellite tag. That satellite tag will now have your shark phone home and send in a message. And that shark leaping there  if you look carefully  has an antenna. It's a free swimming shark with a satellite tag jumping after salmon  sending home its data. Salmon sharks aren't the only sharks we tag. But there goes salmon sharks with this meter level resolution on an ocean of temperature    warm colors are warmer. Salmon sharks go down to the tropics to pup and come into Monterey. Now right next door in Monterey and up at the Farallones are a white shark team led by Scott Anderson    there    and Sal Jorgensen. They can throw out a target    it's a carpet shaped like a seal    and in will come a white shark  a curious critter that will come right up to our    ft. boat. It's a several thousand pound animal. And we'll wind in the target. And we'll place an acoustic tag that says   OMSHARK         or something like that  acoustically with a ping. And then we'll put on a satellite tag that will give us the long distance journeys with the light based geolocation algorithms solved on the computer that's on the fish. So in this case  Sal's looking at two tags there  and there they are  the white sharks of California going off to the white shark cafe and coming back. We also tag makos with our NOAA colleagues  blue sharks. And now  together  what we can see on this ocean of color that's temperature  we can see ten day worms of makos and salmon sharks. We have white sharks and blue sharks. For the first time  an ecoscape as large as ocean scale  showing where the sharks go. The tuna team from TOPP has done the unthinkable  three teams tagged       tunas  bluefin  yellowfin and albacore all at the same time    carefully rehearsed tagging programs in which we go out  pick up juvenile tunas  put in the tags that actually have the sensors  stick out the tuna and then let them go. They get returned  and when they get returned  here on a NASA numerical ocean you can see bluefin in blue go across their corridor  returning to the Western Pacific. Our team from UCSC has tagged elephant seals with tags that are glued on their heads  that come off when they slough. These elephant seals cover half an ocean  take data down to       feet    amazing data. And then there's Scott Shaffer and our shearwaters wearing tuna tags  light based tags  that now are going to take you from New Zealand to Monterey and back  journeys of        nautical miles we had never seen before. But now with light based geolocation tags that are very small  we can actually see these journeys. Same thing with Laysan albatross who travel an entire ocean on a trip sometimes  up to the same zone the tunas use. You can see why they might be caught. Then there's George Schillinger and our leatherback team out of Playa Grande tagging leatherbacks that go right past where we are. And Scott Benson's team that showed that leatherbacks go from Indonesia all the way to Monterey. So what we can see on this moving ocean is we can finally see where the predators are. We can actually see how they're using ecospaces as large as an ocean. And from this information  we can begin to map the hope spots. So this is just three years of data right here    and there's a decade of this data. We see the pulse and the seasonal activities that these animals are going on. So what we're able to do with this information is boil it down to hot spots        deployments  a huge herculean task        tags in an area  shown here for the first time  off the California coast  that appears to be a gathering place. And then for sort of an encore from these animals  they're helping us. They're carrying instruments that are actually taking data down to       meters. They're taking information from our planet at very critical places like Antarctica and the Poles. Those are seals from many countries being released who are sampling underneath the ice sheets and giving us temperature data of oceanographic quality on both poles. This data  when visualized  is captivating to watch. We still haven't figured out best how to visualize the data. And then  as these animals swim and give us the information that's important to climate issues  we also think it's critical to get this information to the public  to engage the public with this kind of data. We did this with the Great Turtle Race    tagged turtles  brought in four million hits. And now with Google's Oceans  we can actually put a white shark in that ocean. And when we do and it swims  we see this magnificent bathymetry that the shark knows is there on its path as it goes from California to Hawaii. But maybe Mission Blue can fill in that ocean that we can't see. We've got the capacity  NASA has the ocean. We just need to put it together. So in conclusion  we know where Yellowstone is for North America  it's off our coast. We have the technology that's shown us where it is. What we need to think about perhaps for Mission Blue is increasing the biologging capacity. How is it that we can actually take this type of activity elsewhere  And then finally    to basically get the message home    maybe use live links from animals such as blue whales and white sharks. Make killer apps  if you will. A lot of people are excited when sharks actually went under the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's connect the public to this activity right on their iPhone. That way we do away with a few internet myths. So we can save the bluefin tuna. We can save the white shark. We have the science and technology. Hope is here. Yes we can. We need just to apply this capacity further in the oceans. Thank you. We are here today because  the  United Nations have defined goals for the progress of countries. They're called Millennium Development Goals. And the reason I really like these goals is that there are eight of them. And by specifying eight different goals  the United Nations has said that there are so many things needed to change in a country in order to get the good life for people. Look here    you have to end poverty  education  gender  child and maternal health  control infections  protect the environment and get the good global links between nations in every aspect from aid to trade. There's a second reason I like these development goals  and that is because each and every one is measured. Take child mortality  the aim here is to reduce child mortality by two thirds  from      to     . That's a four percent reduction per year    and this  with measuring. That's what makes the difference between political talking like this and really going for the important thing  a better life for people. And what I'm so happy about with this is that we have already documented that there are many countries in Asia  in the Middle East  in Latin America and East Europe that  are  reducing with this rate. And even mighty Brazil is going down with five percent per year  and Turkey with seven percent per year. So there's good news. But then I hear people saying   There is no progress in Africa. And there's not even statistics on Africa to know what is happening.  I'll prove them wrong on both points. Come with me to the wonderful world of statistics. I bring you to the webpage  ChildMortality.org  where you can take deaths in children below five years of age for all countries    it's done by U.N. specialists. And I will take Kenya as an example. Here you see the data. Don't panic    don't panic now  I'll help you through this. It looks nasty  like in college when you didn't like statistics. But first thing  when you see dots like this  you have to ask yourself  from where do the data come  What is the origin of the data  Is it so that in Kenya  there are doctors and other specialists who write the death certificate at the death of the child and it's sent to the statistical office  No    low income countries like Kenya still don't have that level of organization. It exists  but it's not complete because so many deaths occur in the home with the family  and it's not registered. What we rely on is not an incomplete system. We have interviews  we have surveys. And this is highly professional female interviewers who sit down for one hour with a woman and ask her about  her  birth history. How many children did you have  Are they alive  If they died  at what age and what year  And then this is done in a representative sample of thousands of women in the country and put together in what used to be called a demographic health survey report. But these surveys are costly  so they can only be done  in  three  to five year intervals. But they have good quality. So this is a limitation. And all these colored lines here are results  each color is one survey. But that's too complicated for today  so I'll simplify it for you  and I give you one average point for each survey. This was                   '   and     . And when the experts in the U.N. have got these surveys in place in their database  then they use advanced mathematical formulas to produce a trend line  and the trend line looks like this. See here    it's the best fit they can get of this point. But watch out    they continue the line beyond the last point out into nothing. And they estimated that in       Kenya had per child mortality of    . And I was sad  because we could see this reversal in Kenya with an increased child mortality in the   s. It was so tragic. But in June  I got a mail in my inbox from Demographic Health Surveys  and it showed good news from Kenya. I was so happy. This was the estimate of the new survey. Then it just took another three months for  the  U.N. to get it into their server  and on Friday we got the new trend line    it was down here. Isn't it nice    isn't it nice  yeah  I was actually  on Friday  sitting in front of my computer  and I saw the death rate fall from     to    just that morning. So we celebrated. But now  when you have this trend line  how do we measure progress  I'm going into some details here  because  the  U.N. do it like this. They start  in          they measure to     . They say    .  percent  no progress.  That's unfair. As a professor  I think I have the right to propose something differently. I would say  at least do this       years is enough to follow the trend. It's two surveys  and you can see what's happening now. They have  .  percent. Had I been in the Ministry of Health in Kenya  I may have joined these two points. So what I'm telling you is that we know the child mortality. We have a decent trend. It's coming into some tricky things then when we are measuring MDGs. And the reason here for Africa is especially important  because '  s was a bad decade  not only in Kenya  but across Africa. The HIV epidemic peaked. There was resistance for the old malaria drugs  until we got the new drugs. We got  later  the mosquito netting. And there was socio economic problems  which are now being solved at a much better scale. So look at the average here    this is the average for all of sub Saharan Africa. And  the  U.N. says it's a reduction with  .  percent. Now this sounds a little theoretical  but it's not so theoretical. You know  these economists  they love money  they want more and more of it  they want it to grow. So they calculate the percent annual growth rate of  the  economy. We in public health  we hate child death  so we want less and less and less of child deaths. So we calculate the percent reduction per year  but it's sort of the same percentage. If your economy grows with four percent  you ought to reduce child mortality four percent  if it's used well and people are really involved and can get the use of the resources in the way they want it. So is this fair now to measure this over    years  An economist would never do that. I have just divided it into two periods. In the   s  only  .  percent  only  .  percent. Whereas now  second gear    it's like Africa had first gear  now they go into second gear. But even this is not a fair representation of Africa  because it's an average  it's an average speed of reduction in Africa. And look here when I take you into my bubble graphs. Still here  child death per       on that axis. Here we have  the  year. And I'm now giving you a wider picture than the MDG. I start    years ago when Africa celebrated independence in most countries. I give you Congo  which was high  Ghana    lower. And Kenya    even lower. And what has happened over the years since then  Here we go. You can see  with independence  literacy improved and vaccinations started  smallpox was eradicated  hygiene was improved  and things got better. But then  in the '  s  watch out here. Congo got into civil war  and they leveled off here. Ghana got very ahead  fast. This was the backlash in Kenya  and Ghana bypassed  but then Kenya and Ghana go down together    still a standstill in Congo. That's where we are today. You can see it doesn't make sense to make an average of this zero improvement and this very fast improvement. Time has come to stop thinking about sub Saharan Africa as one place. Their countries are so different  and they merit to be recognized in the same way  as we don't talk about Europe as one place. I can tell you that the economy in Greece and Sweden are very different    everyone knows that. And they are judged  each country  on how they are doing. So let me show the wider picture. My country  Sweden        we were up there. What a strange personality disorder we must have  counting the children so meticulously in spite of a high child death rate. It's very strange. It's sort of embarrassing. But we had that habit in Sweden  you know  that we counted all the child deaths  even if we didn't do anything about it. And then  you see  these were famine years. These were bad years  and people got fed up with Sweden. My ancestors moved to the United States. And eventually  soon they started to get better and better here. And here we got better education  and we got health service  and child mortality came down. We never had a war  Sweden was in peace all this time. But look  the rate of lowering in Sweden was not fast. Sweden achieved a low child mortality because we started early. We had primary school actually started in     . And then you get that wonderful effect when we got female literacy one generation later. You have to realize that the investments we do in progress are long term investments. It's not about just five years    it's long term investments. And Sweden never reached  the  Millennium Development Goal rate   .  percent when I calculated. So we are off track    that's what Sweden is. But you don't talk about it so much. We want others to be better than we were  and indeed  others have been better. Let me show you Thailand  see what a success story  Thailand from the     s    how they went down here and reached almost the same child mortality levels as Sweden. And I'll give you another story    Egypt  the most hidden  glorious success in public health. Egypt was up here in       higher than Congo. The Nile Delta was a misery for children with diarrheal disease and malaria and a lot of problems. And then they got the Aswan Dam. They got electricity in their homes  they increased education and they got primary health care. And down they went  you know. And they got safer water  they eradicated malaria. And isn't it a success story. Millennium Development Goal rates for child mortality is fully possible. And the good thing is that Ghana today is going with the same rate as Egypt did at its fastest. Kenya is now speeding up. Here we have a problem. We have a severe problem in countries which are at a standstill. Now  let me now bring you to a wider picture  a wider picture of child mortality. I'm going to show you the relationship between child mortality on this axis here    this axis here is child mortality    and here I have the family size. The relationship between child mortality and family size. One  two  three  four children per woman  six  seven  eight children per woman. This is  once again             years ago. Each bubble is a country    the color  you can see  a continent. The dark blue here is sub Saharan Africa. And the size of the bubble is the population. And these are the so called  developing  countries. They had high  or very high  child mortality and family size  six to eight. And the ones over there  they were so called Western countries. They had low child mortality and small families. What has happened  What I want you  to do  now is to see with your own eyes the relation between fall in child mortality and decrease in family size. I just want not to have any room for doubt    you have to see that for yourself. This is what happened. Now I start the world. Here we come down with the eradication of smallpox  better education  health service. It got down there    China comes into the Western box here. And here Brazil is in the Western Box. India is approaching. The first African countries coming into the Western box  and we get a lot a new neighbors. Welcome to a decent life. Come on. We want everyone down there. This is the vision we have  isn't it. And look now  the first African countries here are coming in. There we are today. There is no such thing as a  Western world  and  developing world.  This is the report from  the  U.N.  which came out on Friday. It's very good     Levels and Trends in Child Mortality     except this page. This page is very bad  it's a categorization of countries. It labels  developing countries      I can read from the list here    developing countries  Republic of Korea    South Korea. Huh  They get Samsung  how can they be  a  developing country  They have here Singapore. They have the lowest child mortality in the world  Singapore. They bypassed Sweden five years ago  and they are labeled a developing country. They have here Qatar. It's the richest country in the world with Al Jazeera. How the heck could they be  a  developing country  This is crap. The rest here is good    the rest is good. We have to have a modern concept  which fits to the data. And we have to realize that we are all going to into this  down to here. What is the importance now with the relations here. Look    even if we look in Africa    these are the African countries. You can clearly see the relation with falling child mortality and decreasing family size  even within Africa. It's very clear that this is what happens. And a very important piece of research came out on Friday from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle showing that almost    percent of the fall in child mortality can be attributed to female education. That is  when we get girls in school  we'll get an impact    to    years later  which is a secular trend which is very strong. That's why we must have that long term perspective  but we must measure the impact over    year periods. It's fully possible to get child mortality down in all of these countries and to get them down in the corner where we all would like to live together. And of course  lowering child mortality is a matter of utmost importance from humanitarian aspects. It's a decent life for children  we are talking about. But it is also a strategic investment in the future of all mankind  because it's about the environment. We will not be able to manage the environment and avoid the terrible climate crisis if we don't stabilize the world population. Let's be clear about that. And the way to do that  that is to get child mortality down  get access to family planning and behind that drive female education. And that is fully possible. Let's do it. Thank you very much. Imagine  if you will    a gift. I'd like for you to picture it in your mind. It's not too big    about the size of a golf ball. So envision what it looks like all wrapped up. But before I show you what's inside  I will tell you  it's going to do incredible things for you. It will bring all of your family together. You will feel loved and appreciated like never before and reconnect with friends and acquaintances you haven't heard from in years. Adoration and admiration will overwhelm you. It will recalibrate what's most important in your life. It will redefine your sense of spirituality and faith. You'll have a new understanding and trust in your body. You'll have unsurpassed vitality and energy. You'll expand your vocabulary  meet new people  and you'll have a healthier lifestyle. And get this    you'll have an eight week vacation of doing absolutely nothing. You'll eat countless gourmet meals. Flowers will arrive by the truckload. People will say to you   You look great. Have you had any work done   And you'll have a lifetime supply of good drugs. You'll be challenged  inspired  motivated and humbled. Your life will have new meaning. Peace  health  serenity  happiness  nirvana. The price           and that's an incredible deal. By now I know you're dying to know what it is and where you can get one. Does Amazon carry it  Does it have the Apple logo on it  Is there a waiting list  Not likely. This gift came to me about five months ago. It looked more like this when it was all wrapped up    not quite so pretty. And this  and then this. It was a rare gem    a brain tumor  hemangioblastoma    the gift that keeps on giving. And while I'm okay now  I wouldn't wish this gift for you. I'm not sure you'd want it. But I wouldn't change my experience. It profoundly altered my life in ways I didn't expect in all the ways I just shared with you. So the next time you're faced with something that's unexpected  unwanted and uncertain  consider that it just may be a gift. Sometimes I go browsing  through  a very old magazine. I found this observation test about the story of the ark. And the artist that drew this observation test did some errors  had some mistakes    there are more or less    mistakes. Some of them are very easy. There is a funnel  an aerial part  a lamp and clockwork key on the ark. Some of them are about the animals  the number. But there is a much more fundamental mistake in the overall story of the ark that's not reported here. And this problem is  where are the plants  So now we have God that is going to submerge Earth permanently or at least for a very long period  and no one is taking care of plants. Noah needed to take two of every kind of bird  of every kind of animal  of every kind of creature that moves  but no mention about plants. Why  In another part of the same story  all the living creatures are just the living creatures that came out from the ark  so birds  livestock and wild animals. Plants are not living creatures    this is the point. That is a point that is not coming out from the Bible  but it's something that really accompanied humanity. Let's have a look at this nice code that is coming from a Renaissance book. Here we have the description of the order of nature. It's a nice description because it's starting from left    you have the stones    immediately after the stones  the plants that are just able to live. We have the animals that are able to live and to sense  and on the top of the pyramid  there is the man. This is not the common man. The  Homo studiosus     the studying man. This is quite comforting for people like me    I'm a professor    this to be over there on the top of creation. But it's something completely wrong. You know very well about professors. But it's also wrong about plants  because plants are not just able to live  they are able to sense. They are much more sophisticated in sensing than animals. Just to give you an example  every single root apex is able to detect and to monitor concurrently and continuously at least    different chemical and physical parameters. And they also are able to show and to exhibit such a wonderful and complex behavior that can be described just with the term of intelligence. Well  but this is something    this underestimation of plants is something that is always with us. Let's have a look at this short movie now. We have David Attenborough. Now David Attenborough is really a plant lover  he did some of the most beautiful movies about plant behavior. Now  when he speaks about plants  everything is correct. When he speaks about animals   he  tends to remove the fact that plants exist. The blue whale  the biggest creature that exists on the planet    that is wrong  completely wrong. The blue whale  it's a dwarf if compared with the real biggest creature that exists on the planet    that is  this wonderful  magnificent Sequoiadendron giganteum. And this is a living organism that has a mass of at least       tons. Now  the story that plants are some low level organisms has been formalized many times ago by Aristotle  that in  De Anima     that is a very influential book for the Western civilization    wrote that the plants are on the edge between living and not living. They have just a kind of very low level soul. It's called the vegetative soul  because they lack movement  and so they don't need to sense. Let's see. Okay  some of the movements of the plants are very well known. This is a very fast movement. This is a Dionaea  a Venus fly trap hunting snails    sorry for the snail. This has been something that has been refused for centuries  despite the evidence. No one can say that the plants were able to eat an animal  because it was against the order of nature. But plants are also able to show a lot of movement. Some of them are very well known  like the flowering. It's just a question to use some techniques like the time lapse. Some of them are much more sophisticated. Look at this young bean that is moving to catch the light every time. And it's really so graceful  it's like a dancing angel. They are also able to play    they are really playing. These are young sunflowers  and what they are doing cannot be described with any other terms than playing. They are training themselves  as many young animals do  to the adult life where they will be called to track the sun all the day. They are able to respond to gravity  of course  so the shoots are growing against the vector of gravity and the roots toward the vector of gravity. But they are also able to sleep. This is one  Mimosa pudica. So during the night  they curl the leaves and reduce the movement  and during the day  you have the opening of the leaves    there is much more movement. This is interesting because this sleeping machinery  it's perfectly conserved. It's the same in plants  in insects and in animals. And so if you need to study this sleeping problem  it's easy to study on plants  for example  than in animals and it's much more easy even ethically. It's a kind of vegetarian experimentation. Plants are even able to communicate    they are extraordinary communicators. They communicate with other plants. They are able to distinguish kin and non kin. They communicate with plants of other species and they communicate with animals by producing chemical volatiles  for example  during the pollination. Now with the pollination  it's a very serious issue for plants  because they move the pollen from one flower to the other  yet they cannot move from one flower to the other. So they need a vector    and this vector  it's normally an animal. Many insects have been used by plants as vectors for the transport of the pollination  but not just insects  even birds  reptiles  and mammals like bats rats are normally used for the transportation of the pollen. This is a serious business. We have the plants that are giving to the animals a kind of sweet substance    very energizing    having in change this transportation of the pollen. But some plants are manipulating animals  like in the case of orchids that promise sex and nectar and give in change nothing for the transportation of the pollen. Now  there is a big problem behind all this behavior that we have seen. How is it possible to do this without a brain  We need to wait until       when this big man  Charles Darwin  publishes a wonderful  astonishing book that starts a revolution. The title is  The Power of Movement in Plants.  No one was allowed to speak about movement in plants before Charles Darwin. In his book  assisted by his son  Francis    who was the first professor of plant physiology in the world  in Cambridge    they took into consideration every single movement for     pages. And in the last paragraph of the book  it's a kind of stylistic mark  because normally Charles Darwin stored  in the last paragraph of a book  the most important message. He wrote that   It's hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radical acts like the brain of one of the lower animals.  This is not a metaphor. He wrote some very interesting letters to one of his friends who was J.D. Hooker  or at that time  president of the Royal Society  so the maximum scientific authority in Britain speaking about the brain in the plants. Now  this is a root apex growing against a slope. So you can recognize this kind of movement  the same movement that worms  snakes and every animal that are moving on the ground without legs is able to display. And it's not an easy movement because  to have this kind of movement  you need to move different regions of the root and to synchronize these different regions without having a brain. So we studied the root apex and we found that there is a specific region that is here  depicted in blue    that is called the  transition zone.  And this region  it's a very small region    it's less than one millimeter. And in this small region you have the highest consumption of oxygen in the plants and more important  you have these kinds of signals here. The signals that you are seeing here are action potential  are the same signals that the neurons of my brain  of our brain  use to exchange information. Now we know that a root apex has just a few hundred cells that show this kind of feature  but we know how big the root apparatus of a small plant  like a plant of rye. We have almost    million roots. We have    and a half million root apex and a total length of     or more kilometers and a very high surface area. Now let's imagine that each single root apex is working in network with all the others. Here were have on the left  the Internet and on the right  the root apparatus. They work in the same way. They are a network of small computing machines  working in networks. And why are they so similar  Because they evolved for the same reason  to survive predation. They work in the same way. So you can remove    percent of the root apparatus and the plants  continue  to work. You can remove    percent of the Internet and it is  continuing  to work. So  a suggestion for the people working with networks  plants are able to give you good suggestions about how to evolve networks. And another possibility is a technological possibility. Let's imagine that we can build robots and robots that are inspired by plants. Until now  the man was inspired just by man or the animals in producing a robot. We have the animaloid    and the normal robots inspired by animals  insectoid  so on. We have the androids that are inspired by man. But why have we not any plantoid  Well  if you want to fly  it's good that you look at birds    to be inspired by birds. But if you want to explore soils  or if you want to colonize new territory  to best thing that you can do is to be inspired by plants that are masters in doing this. We have another possibility we are working  on  in our lab   which  is to build hybrids. It's much more easy to build hybrids. Hybrid means it's something that's half living and half machine. It's much more easy to work with plants than with animals. They have computing power  they have electrical signals. The connection with the machine is much more easy  much more even ethically possible. And these are three possibilities that we are working on to build hybrids  driven by algae or by the leaves at the end  by the most  most powerful parts of the plants  by the roots. Well  thank you for your attention. And before I finish  I would like to reassure that no snails were harmed in making this presentation. Thank you. One of my favorite parts of my job at the Gates Foundation is that I get to travel to the developing world  and I do that quite regularly. And when I meet the mothers in so many of these remote places  I'm really struck by the things that we have in common. They want what we want for our children and that is for their children to grow up successful  to be healthy  and to have a successful life. But I also see lots of poverty  and it's quite jarring  both in the scale and the scope of it. My first trip in India  I was in a person's home where they had dirt floors  no running water  no electricity  and that's really what I see all over the world. So in short  I'm startled by all the things that they don't have. But I am surprised by one thing that they do have  Coca Cola. Coke is everywhere. In fact  when I travel to the developing world  Coke feels ubiquitous. And so when I come back from these trips  and I'm thinking about development  and I'm flying home and I'm thinking   We're trying to deliver condoms to people or vaccinations   you know  Coke's success kind of stops and makes you wonder  how is it that they can get Coke to these far flung places  If they can do that  why can't governments and NGOs do the same thing  And I'm not the first person to ask this question. But I think  as a community  we still have a lot to learn. It's staggering  if you think about Coca Cola. They sell  .  billion servings every single day. That's like every man  woman and child on the planet having a serving of Coke every week. So why does this matter  Well  if we're going to speed up the progress and go even faster on the set of Millennium Development Goals that we're set as a world  we need to learn from the innovators  and those innovators come from every single sector. I feel that  if we can understand what makes something like Coca Cola ubiquitous  we can apply those lessons then for the public good. Coke's success is relevant  because if we can analyze it  learn from it  then we can save lives. So that's why I took a bit of time to study Coke. And I think there are really three things we can take away from Coca Cola. They take real time data and immediately feed it back into the product. They tap into local entrepreneurial talent  and they do incredible marketing. So let's start with the data. Now Coke has a very clear bottom line    they report to a set of shareholders  they have to turn a profit. So they take the data  and they use it to measure progress. They have this very continuous feedback loop. They learn something  they put it back into the product  they put it back into the market. They have a whole team called  Knowledge and Insight.  It's a lot like other consumer companies. So if you're running Namibia for Coca Cola  and you have a     constituencies  you know where every can versus bottle of Sprite  Fanta or Coke was sold  whether it was a corner store  a supermarket or a pushcart. So if sales start to drop  then the person can identify the problem and address the issue. Let's contrast that for a minute to development. In development  the evaluation comes at the very end of the project. I've sat in a lot of those meetings  and by then  it is way too late to use the data. I had somebody from an NGO once describe it to me as bowling in the dark. They said   You roll the ball  you hear some pins go down. It's dark  you can't see which one goes down until the lights come on  and then you an see your impact.  Real time data turns on the lights. So what's the second thing that Coke's good at  They're good at tapping into that local entrepreneurial talent. Coke's been in Africa since       but most of the time they couldn't reach the distant markets  because they had a system that was a lot like in the developed world  which was a large truck rolling down the street. And in Africa  the remote places  it's hard to find a good road. But Coke noticed something    they noticed that local people were taking the product  buying it in bulk and then reselling it in these hard to reach places. And so they took a bit of time to learn about that. And they decided in      that they wanted to start training the local entrepreneurs  giving them small loans. They set them up as what they called micro distribution centers  and those local entrepreneurs then hire sales people  who go out with bicycles and pushcarts and wheelbarrows to sell the product. There are now some       of these centers employing about        people in Africa. In Tanzania and Uganda  they represent    percent of Coke's sales. Let's look at the development side. What is it that governments and NGOs can learn from Coke  Governments and NGOs need to tap into that local entrepreneurial talent as well  because the locals know how to reach the very hard to serve places  their neighbors  and they know what motivates them to make change. I think a great example of this is Ethiopia's new health extension program. The government noticed in Ethiopia that many of the people were so far away from a health clinic  they were over a day's travel away from a health clinic. So if you're in an emergency situation    or if you're a mom about to deliver a baby    forget it  to get to the health care center. They decided that wasn't good enough  so they went to India and studied the Indian state of Kerala that also had a system like this  and they adapted it for Ethiopia. And in       the government of Ethiopia started this new system in their own country. They trained        health extension workers to deliver care directly to the people. In just five years  their ratio went from one worker for every        people to one worker for every       people. Now  think about how this can change people's lives. Health extension workers can help with so many things  whether it's family planning  prenatal care  immunizations for the children  or advising the woman to get to the facility on time for an on time delivery. That is having real impact in a country like Ethiopia  and it's why you see their child mortality numbers coming down    percent from      to     . In Ethiopia  there are hundreds of thousands of children living because of this health extension worker program. So what's the next step for Ethiopia  Well  they're already starting talk about this. They're starting to talk about   How do you have the health community workers generate their own ideas  How do you incent them based on the impact that they're getting out in those remote villages   That's how you tap into local entrepreneurial talent and you unlock people's potential. The third component of Coke's success is marketing. Ultimately  Coke's success depends on one crucial fact and that is that people want a Coca Cola. Now the reason these micro entrepreneurs can sell or make a profit is they have to sell every single bottle in their pushcart or their wheelbarrow. So  they rely on Coca Cola in terms of its marketing  and what's the secret to their marketing  Well  it's aspirational. It is associated that product with a kind of life that people want to live. So even though it's a global company  they take a very local approach. Coke's global campaign slogan is  Open Happiness.  But they localize it. And they don't just guess what makes people happy  they go to places like Latin America and they realize that happiness there is associated with family life. And in South Africa  they associate happiness with seriti or community respect. Now  that played itself out in the World Cup campaign. Let's listen to this song that Coke created for it   Wavin' Flag  by a Somali hip hop artist.   Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh     Oh oh oh oh oh o oh     Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh o oh    Give you freedom  give you fire    Give you reason  take you higher     See the champions take the field now     You define us  make us feel proud     In the streets our heads are lifted     As we lose our inhibition     Celebration  it's around us     Every nation  all around us   Melinda French Gates  It feels pretty good  right  Well  they didn't stop there    they localized it into    different languages. And it went number one on the pop chart in    countries. It reminds me of a song that I remember from my childhood   I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing   that also went number one on the pop charts. Both songs have something in common  that same appeal of celebration and unity. So how does health and development market  Well  it's based on avoidance  not aspirations. I'm sure you've heard some of these messages.  Use a condom  don't get AIDS.   Wash you hands  you might not get diarrhea.  It doesn't sound anything like  Wavin' Flag  to me. And I think we make a fundamental mistake    we make an assumption  that we think that  if people need something  we don't have to make them want that. And I think that's a mistake. And there's some indications around the world that this is starting to change. One example is sanitation. We know that a million and a half children die a year from diarrhea and a lot of it is because of open defecation. But there's a solution  you build a toilet. But what we're finding around the world  over and over again  is  if you build a toilet and you leave it there  it doesn't get used. People reuse it for a slab for their home. They sometimes store grain in it. I've even seen it used for a chicken coop. But what does marketing really entail that would make a sanitation solution get a result in diarrhea  Well  you work with the community. You start to talk to them about why open defecation is something that shouldn't be done in the village  and they agree to that. But then you take the toilet and you position it as a modern  trendy convenience. One state in Northern India has gone so far as to link toilets to courtship. And it works    look at these headlines. I'm not kidding. Women are refusing to marry men without toilets. No loo  no  I do.  Now  it's not just a funny headline    it's innovative. It's an innovative marketing campaign. But more importantly  it saves lives. Take a look at this    this is a room full of young men and my husband  Bill. And can you guess what the young men are waiting for  They're waiting to be circumcised. Can you you believe that  We know that circumcision reduces HIV infection by    percent in men. And when we first heard this result inside the Foundation  I have to admit  Bill and I were scratching our heads a little bit and we were saying   But who's going to volunteer for this procedure   But it turns out the men do  because they're hearing from their girlfriends that they prefer it  and the men also believe it improves their sex life. So if we can start to understand what people really want in health and development  we can change communities and we can change whole nations. Well  why is all of this so important  So let's talk about what happens when this all comes together  when you tie the three things together. And polio  I think  is one of the most powerful examples. We've seen a    percent reduction in polio in    years. So if you look back to       there are about         cases of polio on the planet that year. In       we're down to       cases. Well how did that happen  Let's look at a country like India. They have over a billion people in this country  but they have        local doctors who report paralysis  and clinicians  a huge reporting system in chemists. They have two and a half million vaccinators. But let me make the story a little bit more concrete for you. Let me tell you the story of Shriram  an    month boy in Bihar  a northern state in India. This year on August  th  he felt paralysis and on the   th  his parents took him to the doctor. On August   th and   th  they took a stool sample  and by the   th of August  it was confirmed he had Type   polio. By August   th  a genetic test was done  and we knew what strain of polio Shriram had. Now it could have come from one of two places. It could have come from Nepal  just to the north  across the border  or from Jharkhand  a state just to the south. Luckily  the genetic testing proved that  in fact  this strand came north  because  had it come from the south  it would have had a much wider impact in terms of transmission. So many more people would have been affected. So what's the endgame  Well on September  th  there was a huge mop up campaign  which is what you do in polio. They went out and where Shriram lives  they vaccinated two million people. So in less than a month  we went from one case of paralysis to a targeted vaccination program. And I'm happy to say only one other person in that area got polio. That's how you keep a huge outbreak from spreading  and it shows what can happen when local people have the data in their hands  they can save lives. Now one of the challenges in polio  still  is marketing  but it might not be what you think. It's not the marketing on the ground. It's not telling the parents   If you see paralysis  take your child to the doctor or get your child vaccinated.  We have a problem with marketing in the donor community. The G  nations have been incredibly generous on polio over the last    years  but we're starting to have something called polio fatigue and that is that the donor nations aren't willing to fund polio any longer. So by next summer  we're sighted to run out of money on polio. So we are    percent of the way there on this goal and we're about to run short of money. And I think that if the marketing were more aspirational  if we could focus as a community on how far we've come and how amazing it would be to eradicate this disease  we could put polio fatigue and polio behind us. And if we could do that  we could stop vaccinating everybody  worldwide  in all of our countries for polio. And it would only be the second disease ever wiped off the face of the planet. And we are so close. And this victory is so possible. So if Coke's marketers came to me and asked me to define happiness  I'd say my vision of happiness is a mother holding healthy baby in her arms. To me  that is deep happiness. And so if we can learn lessons from the innovators in every sector  then in the future we make together  that happiness can be just as ubiquitous as Coca Cola. Thank you. I learned about the Haiti earthquake by Skype. My wife sent me a message   Whoa  earthquake   and then disappeared for    minutes. It was    minutes of absolute terror that thousands of people across the U.S. felt. I was afraid of a tsunami  what I didn't realize was there was a greater terror in Haiti  and that was building collapse. We've all seen the photos of the collapsed buildings in Haiti. These are shots my wife took a couple days after the quake  while I was making my way through the D.R. into the country. This is the national palace    the equivalent of the White House. This is the largest supermarket in the Caribbean at peak shopping time. This is a nurses' college    there are     nurses studying. The general hospital right next door emerged largely unscathed. This is the Ministry of Economics and Finance. We have all heard about the tremendous human loss in the earthquake in Haiti  but we haven't heard enough about why all those lives were lost. We haven't heard about why the buildings failed. After all  it was the buildings  not the earthquake  that killed         people  that injured          that displaced  .  million people  that cut off food and water and supplies for an entire nation. This is the largest metropolitan area disaster in decades  and it was not a natural disaster    it was a disaster of engineering. AIDG has worked in Haiti since       providing engineering and business support to small businesses. And after the quake  we started bringing in earthquake engineers to figure out why the buildings collapsed  to examine what was safe and what wasn't. Working with MINUSTAH  which is the U.N. mission in Haiti  with the Ministry of Public Works  with different NGOs  we inspected over       buildings. We inspected schools and private residencies. We inspected medical centers and food warehouses. We inspected government buildings. This is the Ministry of Justice. Behind that door is the National Judicial Archives. The fellow in the door  Andre Filitrault    who's the director of the Center for Interdisciplinary Earthquake Engineering Research at the University of Buffalo    was examining it to see if it was safe to recover the archives. Andre told me  after seeing these buildings fail again and again in the same way  that there is no new research here. There is nothing here that we don't know. The failure points were the same  walls and slabs not tied properly into columns    that's a roof slab hanging off the building    cantilevered structures  or structures that were asymmetric  that shook violently and came down  poor building materials  not enough concrete  not enough compression in the blocks  rebar that was smooth  rebar that was exposed to the weather and had rusted away. Now there's a solution to all these problems. And we know how to build properly. The proof of this came in Chile  almost a month later  when  .  magnitude earthquake hit Chile. That is     times the power of the  .  that hit Port au Prince        times the power  yet only under a thousand casualties. Adjusted for population density  that is less than one percent of the impact of the Haitian quake. What was the difference between Chile and Haiti  Seismic standards and confined masonry  where the building acts as a whole    walls and columns and roofs and slabs tied together to support each other    instead of breaking off into separate members and failing. If you look at this building in Chile  it's ripped in half  but it's not a pile of rubble. Chileans have been building with confined masonry for decades. Right now  AIDG is working with KPFF Consulting Engineers  Architecture for Humanity  to bring more confined masonry training into Haiti. This is Xantus Daniel  he's a mason  just a general construction worker  not a foreman  who took one of our trainings. On his last job he was working with his boss  and they started pouring the columns wrong. He took his boss aside  and he showed him the materials on confined masonry. He showed him   You know  we don't have to do this wrong. It won't cost us any more to do it the right way.  And they redid that building. They tied the rebar right  they poured the columns right  and that building will be safe. And every building that they build going forward will be safe. To make sure these buildings are safe  it's not going to take policy    it's going to take reaching out to the masons on the ground and helping them learn the proper techniques. Now there are many groups doing this. And the fellow in the vest there  Craig Toten  he has pushed forward to get documentation out to all the groups that are doing this. Through Haiti Rewired  through Build Change  Architecture for Humanity  AIDG  there is the possibility to reach out to                  masons across the country and create a movement of proper building. If you reach out to the people on the ground in this collaborative way it's extremely affordable. For the billions spent on reconstruction  you can train masons for dollars on every house that they end up building over their lifetime. Ultimately  there are two ways that you can rebuild Haiti  the way at the top is the way that Haiti's been building for decades. The way at the top is a poorly constructed building that will fail. The way at the bottom is a confined masonry building  where the walls are tied together  the building is symmetric  and it will stand up to an earthquake. For all the disaster  there is an opportunity here to build better houses for the next generation  so that when the next earthquake hits  it is a disaster    but not a tragedy. I was informed by this kind of unoriginal and trite idea that new technologies were an opportunity for social transformation  which is what drove me then  and still  it's a delusion that drives me now. I wanted to update what I've been doing since then    but it's still the same theme song    and introduce you to my lab and current work  which is the Environmental Health Clinic that I run at NYU. And what it is    it's a twist on health. Because  really  what I'm trying to do now is redefine what counts as health. It's a clinic like a health clinic at any other university  except people come to the clinic with environmental health concerns  and they walk out with prescriptions for things they can do to improve environmental health  as opposed to coming to a clinic with medical concerns and walking out with prescriptions for pharmaceuticals. It's a handy dandy quote from Hippocrates of the Hippocratic oath that says   The greater part of the soul lays outside the body  treatment of the inner requires treatment of the outer.  But that suggests the issue that I'm trying to get at here  that we have an opportunity to redefine what is health. Because this idea that health is internal and atomized and individual and pharmaceutical is largely an error. And I would use this study  a recent study by Philip Landrigan  to motivate a different view of health  where he went to most of the pediatricians in Manhattan and the New York area and logged what they spent their patient hours on.    to    percent of their time was spent on five things. Number one was asthma  number two was developmental delays  number three was     fold increases in rare childhood cancers in the last eight to        years. Number four and five were childhood obesity and diabetes related issues. So all of those    what's common about all of those  The environment is implicated  radically implicated  right. This is not the germs that medicos were trained to deal with  this is a different definition of health  health that has a great advantage because it's external  it's shared  we can do something about it  as opposed to internal  genetically predetermined or individualized. People who come to the clinic are called  not patients  but impatients  because they're too impatient to wait for legislative change to address local and environmental health issues. And I meet them at the University  I also have a few field offices that I set up in various places that provide an immersion in some of the environmental challenges we face. I like this one from the Belgian field office  where we met in a roundabout  precisely because the roundabout iconified the headless social movement that informs much social transformation  as opposed to the top down control of red light traffic intersections. In this case  of course  the roundabout with that micro decisions being made in situ by people not being told what to do. But  of course  affords greater throughput  fewer accidents  and an interesting model of social movement. Some of the things that the monitoring protocols have developed  this is the tadpole bureaucrat protocol  or keeping tabs  if you will. What they are is an addition of tadpoles that are named after a local bureaucrat whose decisions affect your water quality. So an impatient concerned for water quality would raise a tadpole bureaucrat in a sample of water in which they're interested. And we give them a couple of things to do that  to help them do companion animal devices while they're blogging and doing their email. This is a tadpole walker to take your tadpole walking in the evening. And the interesting thing that happens    because we're using tadpoles  of course  because they have the most exquisite biosenses that we have  several orders of magnitude more sensitive than some of our senses for sensing  responding in a biologically meaningful way  to that whole class of industrial contaminants we call endocrine disruptors or hormone emulators. But by taking your tadpole out for a walk in the evening    there's a few action shots    your neighbors are likely to say   What are you doing   And then you have to introduce your tadpole and who it's named after. You have to explain what you're doing and how the developmental events of a tadpole are  of course  very observable and they use the same T  mediated hormones that we do. And so next time your neighbor sees you they'll say   How is that tadpole doing   And you can let them social network with your tadpole  because the Environmental Health Clinic has a social networking site for  not only impatients  humans  but non humans  social networking for humans and non humans. And of course  these endocrine disruptors are things that are implicated in the breast cancer epidemic  the obesity epidemic  the two and a half year drop in the average age of onset of puberty in young girls and other related things. The culmination of this is if you've successfully raised your tadpole  observing the behavioral and developmental events  you will then go and introduce your tadpole to its namesake and discuss the evidence that you've seen. Another quick protocol    and I'm going to go through these quickly  but just to give you the material sense of what we're doing here    instead of asking you for urine samples  I'll ask you for a mouse sample. Anyone here lucky enough to share  to cohabit with a mouse    a domestic partnership with mice  Very lucky. Mice  of course  are the quintessential model organism. They're even better models of environmental health  because not only the same mammalian biology  but they share your diet  largely. They share your environmental stressors  the asbestos levels and lead levels  whatever you're exposed to. And they're geographically more limited than you are  because we don't know if you've been exposed to persistent organic pollutants in your home  or occupationally or as a child. Mice are a very good representation. So it starts by building a better mousetrap  of course. This is one of them. Coping with environmental stressors is tricky. Is anybody here on antidepressants  There's a lot of people in Manhattan are. And we were testing if the mice would also self administer SSRIs. So this was Prozac  this was Zoloft  this was a black jellybean and this was muscle relaxant  all of which were the medications that the impatient was taking. So do you think the mice self administered antidepressants  What's the     Audience  Sure. Yes.  How did you know that  They did. This was vodka and solution  gin and solution. This guy also liked plain water and the muscle relaxant. Where's our expert  Vodka  gin    Yes. Yes. You know your mice well. They did  yes. So they drank as much vodka as they did plain water  which was interesting. Then of course  it goes into the entrapment device. There's an old cellphone in there    a good use for old cellphones    which dials the clinic  we go and pick up the mouse. We take the blood sample and do the blood work and hair work on the mice. And I want to sort of point out the big advantage of framing health in this external way. But we do have a few prescription products through this. It's very different from the medical model. Anything you do to improve your water quality or air quality  or to understand it or to change it  the benefits are enjoyed by anyone you share that water quality or air quality with. And that aggregating effect  that collective action effect  is actually something we can use to our advantage. So I want to show you one prescription product in the clinic called the No Park. This is a prescription to improve water quality. Many impatients are very concerned for water quality and air quality. What we do is we take a fire hydrant  a  no parking  space associated with a fire hydrant  and we prescribe the removal of the asphalt to create an engineered micro landscape  to create an infiltration opportunity. Because  many of you will know  that the biggest pollution burden that we have on the New York  New Jersey harbor right now is no longer the point sources  no longer the big polluters  no longer the GEs  but that massive network of roads   those  impervious surfaces  that collect all that cadmium neurotoxin that comes from your brake liners or the oily hydrocarbon waste in every single storm event and medieval infrastructure washes it straight into the estuary system. That doesn't do a lot of good. These are little opportunities to intercept those pollutants before they enter the harbor  and they're produced by impatients on various city blocks in some very interesting ways. I just want to say it was sort of a rule of thumb though  there's about two or three fire hydrants on every city block. By creating engineered micro landscapes to infiltrate in them  we don't prevent them from being used as emergency vehicle parking spaces  because  of course  a firetruck can come and park there. They flatten a few plants. No big deal  they'll regenerate. But if we did this in every single    every fire hydrant we could redefine the emergency. That    percent of the time when a firetruck is not parking there  it's infiltrating pollutants. It's also increasing fixing CO s  sequestering some of the airborne pollutants. And aggregated  these smaller interceptions could actually infiltrate all the roadborne pollution that now runs into the estuary system  up to a seven inch rain event  up to a hundred year storm. So these are small actions that can amount to a significant effect to improve local environmental health. This is one of the more ambitious ones. What the climate crisis has revealed to us is a secondary  more insidious and more pervasive crisis  which is the crisis of agency  which is what to do. Somehow buying a local lettuce  changing a light bulb  driving the speed limit  changing your tires regularly  doesn't seem sufficient in the face of climate crisis. And this is an interesting icon that happened    you remember these  fallout shelters. What is the fallout shelter for the climate crisis  This was civic mobilization. Churches  school groups  hospitals  private residents    everyone built one of these in a matter of months. And they still remain as icons of civic response in the face of shared  uncertain  collective threat. Fallout shelter for the climate crisis  I would say  looks something like this  or this  which is an intensive urban agriculture facility that's due to go on my lab building at NYU. What it does is a very simple idea of taking       to    percent of the CO  produced in Manhattan is building related    we take  just like a commercial greenhouse  we take the CO  from the building    CO  enriched air    we force it through the urban agriculture facility  and then we resupply oxygen enriched air. You can't actually build much on a roof  they're not designed for that. So it's on legs  so it focuses all the load on the masonry walls and the columns. It's built as a barn raising  using open source hardware. This is the quarter scale prototype that was functioning in Spain. This is what it will look like  fingers crossed  NYU willing. And what I want to show you is    actually this is one of the components of it that we've just recently been testing    which is a solar chimney    we have got    of them now put around New York at the moment    that passively draws air up. You understand a solar chimney. Hot air rises. You put a bit of black plastic on the side of a building  it'll heat up  and you'll get passive airflow. What we do is actually put a standard HVAC filter on the top of that. That actually removes about    percent of the carbon black  that stuff that  with ozone  is responsible for about half of global warming's effects  because it changes  it settles on the snow  it changes the reflectors  it changes the transmission qualities of the atmosphere. Carbon black is that grime that otherwise lodges in your pretty pink lungs  and it's associated with. It's not good stuff  and it's from inefficient combustion  not from combustion itself. When we put it through our solar chimney  we remove actually about    percent of that. And then I swap it out with the students and actually re release that carbon black. And we make pencils the length of which measures the grime that we've pulled out of the air. Here's one of them that we have up now. Here's who put them up and who are avid pencil users. Okay  so I want to show you just two more interfaces  because I think one of our big challenges is re imagining our relationship to natural systems  not only through this model of twisted personalized health  but through the animals with whom we cohabit. We are not alone  the animals are moving in. In fact  urban migration now describes the movement of animals formerly known as wild into urban centers. You know  coyote in Central Park  a whale in the Gowanus Canal  elk in Westchester County. It's happening all over the Developed World  probably for loss of habitat  but also because our cities are a little bit more livable than they have been. And every green space we create is an invitation for non humans to cohabit with us. But we've kind of lacked imagination in how we could do that well or interestingly. And I want to show you a few of the technological interfaces that have been developed under the moniker of OOZ    which is zoo backwards and without cages    to try and reform that relationship. This is communication technology for birds. It looks like this. When a bird lands on it  they trigger a sound file. This is actually in the Whitney Museum  where there were six of them  each of which had a different argument on it  different sound file. They said things like this. Recorded Voice  Here's what you need to do. Go down there and buy some of those health food bars  the ones you call bird food  and bring it here and scatter it around. There's a good person. Natalie Jeremijenko  Okay.  Laugher  So there was several of these. The birds were able to jump from one to the other. These are just your average urban pigeon. And an early test which argument elicited cooperative behavior from the people below    about a hundred to one decided that this was the argument that worked best on us. Recorded Voice  Tick  tick  tick. That's the sound of genetic mutations of the avian flu becoming a deadly human flu. Do you know what slows it down  Healthy sub populations of birds  increasing biodiversity generally. It is in your interests that I'm healthy  happy  well fed. Hence  you could share some of your nutritional resources instead of monopolizing them. That is  share your lunch. NJ  It worked  and it's true. The final project I'd like to show you is a new interface for fish that has just been launched    it's actually officially launched next week    with a wonderful commission from the Architectural League. You may not have known that you need to communicate with fish  but there is now a device for you to do so. It looks like this  buoys that float on the water  project three foot up  three foot down. When a fish swims underneath  a light goes on. This is what it looks like. So there's another function on here. This top light is    I'm sorry if I'm making you seasick    this top light is actually a water quality display that shifts from red  when the dissolved oxygen is low  to a blue green  when its dissolved oxygen is high. And then you can also text the fish. So there's business cards down there that'll give you contact details. And they text back. When the buoys get your text  they wink at you twice to say  we've got your message. But perhaps the most popular has been that we've got another array of these boys in the Bronx River  where the first beaver    crazy as he is    to have moved in and built a lodge in New York in     years  hangs out. So updates from a beaver. You can subscribe to updates from him. You can talk to him. And what I like to think of is this is an interface that re scripts how we interact with natural systems  specifically by changing who has information  where they have it  who can make sense of that information  and what you can do about it. In this case  instead of throwing chewing gum  or Doritos or whatever you have in your pocket at the fish    There's a body of water in Iceland that I've been dealing with that's in the middle of the city  and the largest pollution burden on it is not the roadborne pollution  it's actually white bread from people feeding the fish and the birds. Instead of doing that actually  we've developed some fish sticks that you can feed the fish. They're delicious. They're cross species delicious that is  delicious for humans and non humans. But they also have a chelating agent in them. They're nutritionally appropriate  not like Doritos. And so every time that desire to interact with the animals  which is at least as ubiquitous as that sign   Do not feed the animals.  And there's about three of them on every New York City park. And Yellowstone National Park  there's more  do not feed the animals  signs than there are animals you might wish to feed. But in that action  that interaction  by re scripting that  by changing it into an opportunity to offer food that is nutritionally appropriate  that could augment the nutritional resources that we ourselves have depleted for augmenting the fish population and also adding chelating agent  which  like any chelating agent that we use medicinally  binds to the bioaccumulated heavy metals and PCBs that are in the fish living in this particular habitat and allows them to pass it out as a harmless salt where it's complexed by a reactive  effectively removing it from bioavailability. But I wanted to say that interaction  re scripting that interaction  into collective action  collective remediative action  very different from the approach that's being used on the other side on the Hudson River  where we're dredging the PCBs    after    years of legislative and legal struggle  GE's paying for the dredging of the largest Superfund site in the world    we're dredging it  and it'll probably get shipped off to Pennsylvania or the nearest Third World country  where it will continue to be toxic sludge. Displacement is not the way to deal with environmental issues. And that's typically the paradigm under which we've operated. By actually taking the opportunity that new technologies  new interactive technologies  present to re script our interactions  to script them  not just as isolated  individuated interactions  but as collective aggregating actions that can amount to something  we can really begin to address some of our important environmental challenges. Thank you. Every presentation needs this slide in it. It's beautiful  isn't it  Do you see  All the points  all the lines    it's incredible. It is the network  and in my case  the network has been important in media  because I get to connect to people. Isn't it amazing  Through that  I connect to people. And the way that I've been doing it has been multifaceted. For example  I get people to dress up their vacuum cleaners. I put together projects like Earth Sandwich  where I ask people to try and simultaneously place two pieces of bread perfectly opposite each other on the Earth. And people started laying bread in tribute  and eventually a team was able to do it between New Zealand and Spain. It's pretty incredible    the video's online. Connecting to people in projects like YoungmeNowme for example. In YoungmeNowme  the audience was asked to find a childhood photograph of themselves and restage it as an adult. This is the same person    top photo  James  bottom photo   Jennifer . Poignant. This was a Mother's Day gift. Particularly creepy. My favorite of these photos  which I couldn't find  is there's a picture of a    year old woman or so with a little baby on her lap  and the next photo is a     lb man with a tiny  little old lady peaking over his shoulder. But this project changed the way that I thought about connecting to people. This is project called Ray. And what happened was I was sent this piece of audio and had no idea who generated the audio. Somebody said   You have to listen to this.  And this is what came to me. Recording  Hi  my name is Ray  and on yesterday my daughter called me because she was stressed out because of things that were going on on her job that she felt was quite unfair. Being quite disturbed  she called for comfort  and I didn't really know what to tell her  because we have to deal with so much mess in our society. So I was led to write this song just for her  just to give her some encouragement while dealing with stress and pressures on her job. And I figured I'd put it on the Internet for all employees under stress to help you better deal with what you're going through on your job. Here's how the song goes.   I'm about to whip somebody's ass     Oh  I'm about to whip somebody's ass     Oh  if you don't leave me alone      you gonna have to send me home     'Cause I'm about to whip somebody's ass   Now you might not be able to sing that out loud  but you can hum it to yourself  and you know what the words are. And let it give you some strength to get the next few moments on your job. All right. Stay strong. Peace. Ze Frank  So    yeah. No  no  no  shush. We've got to go quickly. So I was so moved by this    this is incredible. This was connecting  right. This was  at a distance  realizing that someone was feeling something  wanting to affect them in a particular way  using media to do it  putting it online and realizing that there was a greater impact. This was incredible  this is what I wanted to do. So the first thing I thought of is we have to thank him. And I asked my audience  I said   Listen to this piece of audio. We have to remix it. He's got a great voice. It's actually in the key of B flat. And have to do something with it.  Hundreds of remixes came back    lots of different attempts. One stood out in particular. It was done by a guy named Goose. Remix    I'm about to whip somebody's ass     Oh  I'm about to whip somebody's ass     Oh  if you don't leave me alone      You gonna have to send me home     Cuz I'm about to whip somebody's ass     I'm about to whip some      ZF  Great  so it was incredible. That song     Applause  Thank you. So that song  somebody told me that it was at a baseball game in Kansas City. In the end  it was one of the top downloads on a whole bunch of music streaming services. And so I said   Let's put this together in an album.  And the audience came together  and they designed an album cover. And I said   If you put it all on this  I'm going to deliver it to him  if you can figure out who this person is   because all I had was his name    Ray    and this little piece of audio and the fact that his daughter was upset. In two weeks  they found him. I received and email and it said   Hi  I'm Ray. I heard you were looking for me.  And I was like   Yeah  Ray. It's been an interesting two weeks.  And so I flew to St. Louis and met Ray  and he's a preacher    among other things. So but anyways  here's the thing    is it reminds me of this  which is a sign that you see in Amsterdam on every street corner. And it's sort of a metaphor for me for the virtual world. I look at this photo  and he seems really interested in what's going on with that button  but it doesn't seem like he is really that interested in crossing the street. And it makes me think of this. On street corners everywhere  people are looking at their cell phones  and it's easy to dismiss this as some sort of bad trend in human culture. But the truth is life is being lived there. When they smile    right  you've seen people stop    all of a sudden  life is being lived there  somewhere up in that weird  dense network. And this is it  right  to feel and be felt. It's the fundamental force that we're all after. We can build all sorts of environments to make it a little bit easier  but ultimately  what we're trying to do is really connect with one other person. And that's not always going to happen in physical spaces. It's also going to now happen in virtual spaces  and we have to get better at figuring that out. I think  of the people that build all this technology in the network  a lot of them aren't very good at connecting with people. This is kind of like something I used to do in third grade. So here's a series of projects over the last few years where I've been inspired by trying to figure out how to really facilitate close connection. Sometimes they're very  very simple things. A Childhood Walk  which is a project where I ask people to remember a walk that they used to take as a child over and over again that was sort of meaningless    like on the route to the bus stop  to a neighbor's house  and take it inside of Google Streetview. And I promise you  if you take that walk inside Google Streetview  you come to a moment where something comes back and hits you in the face. And I collected those moments    the photos inside Google Streetview and the memories  specifically.  Our conversation started with me saying  'I'm bored ' and her replying  'When I'm bored I eat pretzels.' I remember this distinctly because it came up a lot.   Right after he told me and my brother he was going to be separating from my mom  I remember walking to a convenience store and getting a cherry cola.   They used some of the morbidly artist footage  a close up of Chad's shoes in the middle of the highway. I guess the shoes came off when he was hit. He slept over at my house once  and he left his pillow. It had 'Chad' written in magic marker on it. He died long after he left the pillow at my house  but we never got around to returning it.  Sometimes they're a little bit more abstract. This is Pain Pack. Right after September   th  last year  I was thinking about pain and the way that we disperse it  the way that we excise it from our bodies. So what I did is I opened up a hotline    a hotline where people could leave voicemails of their pain  not necessarily related to that event. And people called in and left messages like this. Recording  Okay  here's something. I'm not alone  and I am loved. I'm really fortunate. But sometimes I feel really lonely. And when I feel that way even the smallest act of kindness can make me cry. Like even people in convenience stores saying   Have a nice day   when they're accidentally looking me in the eye. ZF  So what I did was I took those voicemails  and with their permission  converted them to MP s and distributed them to sound editors who created short sounds using just those voicemails. And those were then distributed to DJs who have made hundreds of songs using that source material. We don't have time to play much of it. You can look at it online.  From    to    with love  was a project around the time of the last election cycle  where McCain and Obama both  in their speeches after the election  talked about reconciliation  and I was like   What the hell does that look like   So I thought   Well let's just give it a try. Let's have people hold up signs about reconciliation.  And so some really nice things came together.  I voted blue. I voted red. Together  for our future.  These are very  very cute little things right. Some came from the winning party.  Dear     I promise to listen to you  to fight for you  to respect you always.  Some came from the party who had just lost.  From a    to a     may your party's leadership be as classy as you  but I doubt it.  But the truth was that as this start becoming popular  a couple rightwing blogs and some message boards apparently found it to be a little patronizing  which I could also see. And so I started getting amazing amounts of hate mail  death threats even. And one guy in particular kept on writing me these pretty awful messages  and he was dressed as Batman. And he said   I'm dressed as Batman to hide my identity.  Just in case I thought the real Batman was coming after me  which actually made me feel a little better    like   Phew  it's not him.  So what I did    unfortunately  I was harboring all this kind of awful experience and this pain inside of me  and it started to eat away at my psyche. And I was protecting the project from it  I realized. I was protecting it    I didn't want this special  little group of photographs to get sullied in some way. So what I did  I took all those emails  and I put them together into something called Angrigami  which was an origami template made out of this sort of vile stuff. And I asked people to send me beautiful things made out of the Angrigami. But this was the emotional moment. One of my viewer's uncles died on a particular day and he chose to commemorate it with a piece of hate. It's amazing. The last thing I'm going to tell you about is a series of projects called Songs You Already Know  where the idea was  I was trying to figure out to address particular kinds of emotions with group projects. So one of them was fairly straightforward. A guy said that his daughter got scared at night and could I write a song for her  his daughter. And I said   Oh yeah  I'll try to write a mantra that she can sing to herself to help herself go to sleep.  And this was  Scared.    I don't know why but it helps me get over it     The words of the song just move me along     And somehow I get over it     At least I don't suck at life     I keep on trying despite     At least I don't suck at life     I keep on trying despite     This is a song that I sing when I'm scared of something   Okay  so I wrote that song  right. Thank you. So the nice thing was is he walked by his daughter's room at some point  and she actually was singing that song to herself. So I was like   Awesome. This is great.  And then I got this email. And there's a little bit of a back story to this. And I don't have much time. But the idea was that at one point I did a project called Facebook Me Equals You  where I wanted to experience what it was like to live as another person. So I asked for people's usernames and passwords to be sent to me. And I got a lot  like    in a half an hour. And I shut that part down. And I chose two people to be  and I asked them to send me descriptions of how to act as them on Facebook. One person sent me a very detailed description  the other person didn't. And the person who didn't  it turned out  had just moved to a new city and taken on a new job. So  you know  people were writing me and saying   How's your new job   I was like   I don't know. Didn't know I had one.  But anyway  this same person  Laura  ended up emailing me a little bit after that project. And I felt badly for not having done a good job. And she said   I'm really anxious  I just moved to a new town  I have this new job  and I've just had this incredible amount of anxiety.  So she had seen the  Scared  song and wondered if I could do something. So I asked her   What does it feel like when you feel this way   And she wrote a sort of descriptive set of what it felt like to have had this anxiety. And so what I decided to do. I said   Okay  I'll think about it.  And so quietly in the background  I started sending people this.   You're okay     You'll be fine   So I asked people whether they had basic audio capabilities  just so they could sing along to the song with headphones on  so I could just get their voices back. And this is the kind of thing that I got back. Recording    Hey     You're okay     You'll be fine   ZF  So that's one of the better ones  really. But what's awesome is  as I started getting more and more and more of them  all of a sudden I had        voices from around the world. And when you put them together  something magical happens  something absolutely incredible happens  and all of a sudden I get a chorus from around the world. And what was really great is  I'm putting all this work together in the background  and Laura sent me a follow up email because a good month had passed by. And she said   I know you've forgotten about me. I just want to say thanks for even considering it.  And then a few days later I sent her this.   And things that looked so good yesterday     are now shades of gray     And it seems like the world is spinning     while I'm standing still     Or maybe I am spinning I can't tell     And then you say     Hey     You're okay     You'll be fine     Just breathe     And now the words sing     Hey     You're okay     You'll be fine     Just breathe     Now everybody sings     Hey     You're okay     You'll be fine     Just breathe     Hey     You're okay     You'll be fine     Just breathe     Hey     You're okay     You'll be fine     Just breathe   Thank you. The stories we tell about each other matter very much. The stories we tell ourselves about our own lives matter. And most of all  I think the way that we participate in each other's stories is of deep importance. I was six years old when I first heard stories about the poor. Now I didn't hear those stories from the poor themselves  I heard them from my Sunday school teacher and Jesus  kind of via my Sunday school teacher. I remember learning that people who were poor needed something material    food  clothing  shelter    that they didn't have. And I also was taught  coupled with that  that it was my job    this classroom full of five and six year old children    it was our job  apparently  to help. This is what Jesus asked of us. And then he said   What you do for the least of these  you do for me.  Now I was pretty psyched. I was very eager to be useful in the world    I think we all have that feeling. And also  it was kind of interesting that God needed help. That was news to me  and it felt like it was a very important thing to get to participate in. But I also learned very soon thereafter that Jesus also said  and I'm paraphrasing  the poor would always be with us. This frustrated and confused me  I felt like I had been just given a homework assignment that I had to do  and I was excited to do  but no matter what I would do  I would fail. So I felt confused  a little bit frustrated and angry  like maybe I'd misunderstood something here. And I felt overwhelmed. And for the first time  I began to fear this group of people and to feel negative emotion towards a whole group of people. I imagined in my head  a kind of long line of individuals that were never going away  that would always be with us. They were always going to ask me to help them and give them things  which I was excited to do  but I didn't know how it was going to work. And I didn't know what would happen when I ran out of things to give  especially if the problem was never going away. In the years following  the other stories I heard about the poor growing up were no more positive. For example  I saw pictures and images frequently of sadness and suffering. I heard about things that were going wrong in the lives of the poor. I heard about disease  I heard about war    they always seemed to be kind of related. And in general  I got this sort of idea that the poor in the world lived lives that were wrought with suffering and sadness  devastation  hopelessness. And after a while  I developed what I think many of us do  is this predictable response  where I started to feel bad every time I heard about them. I started to feel guilty for my own relative wealth  because I wasn't doing more  apparently  to make things better. And I even felt a sense of shame because of that. And so naturally  I started to distance myself. I stopped listening to their stories quite as closely as I had before. And I stopped expecting things to really change. Now I still gave    on the outside it looked like I was still quite involved. I gave of my time and my money  I gave when solutions were on sale. The cost of a cup of coffee can save a child's life  right. I mean who can argue with that  I gave when I was cornered  when it was difficult to avoid and I gave  in general  when the negative emotions built up enough that I gave to relieve my own suffering  not someone else's. The truth be told  I was giving out of that place  not out of a genuine place of hope and excitement to help and of generosity. It became a transaction for me  became sort of a trade. I was purchasing something    I was buying my right to go on with my day and not necessarily be bothered by this bad news. And I think the way that we go through that sometimes can  first of all  disembody a group of people  individuals out there in the world. And it can also turn into a commodity  which is a very scary thing. So as I did this  and as I think many of us do this  we kind of buy our distance  we kind of buy our right to go on with our day. I think that exchange can actually get in the way of the very thing that we want most. It can get in the way of our desire to really be meaningful and useful in another person's life and  in short to love. Thankfully  a few years ago  things shifted for me because I heard this gentleman speak  Dr. Muhammad Yunus. I know many in the room probably know exactly who he is  but to give the shorthand version for any who have not heard him speak  Dr. Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago for his work pioneering modern microfinance. When I heard him speak  it was three years before that. But basically  microfinance    if this is new to you as well    think of that as financial services for the poor. Think of all the things you get at your bank and imagine those products and services tailored to the needs of someone living on a few dollars a day. Dr. Yunus shared his story  explaining what that was  and what he had done with his Grameen Bank. He also talked about  in particular  microlending  which is a tiny loan that could help someone start or grow a business. Now  when I heard him speak  it was exciting for a number of reasons. First and foremost  I learned about this new method of change in the world that  for once  showed me  maybe  a way to interact with someone and to give  to share of a resource in a way that wasn't weird and didn't make me feel bad    that was exciting. But more importantly  he told stories about the poor that were different than any stories I had heard before. In fact  those individuals he talked about who were poor was sort of a side note. He was talking about strong  smart  hardworking entrepreneurs who woke up every day and were doing things to make their lives and their family's lives better. All they needed to do that more quickly and to do it better was a little bit of capital. It was an amazing sort of insight for me. And I  in fact  was so deeply moved by this    it's hard to express now how much that affected me    but I was so moved that I actually quit my job a few weeks later  and I moved to East Africa to try to see for myself what this was about. For the first time  actually  in a long time I wanted to meet those individuals  I wanted to meet these entrepreneurs  and see for myself what their lives were actually about. So I spent three months in Kenya  Uganda and Tanzania interviewing entrepreneurs that had received     dollars to start or grow a business. And in fact  through those interactions  for the first time  I was starting to get to be friends with some of those people in that big amorphous group out there that was supposed to be far away. I was starting to be friends and get to know their personal stories. And over and over again  as I interviewed them and spent my days with them  I did hear stories of life change and amazing little details of change. So I would hear from goat herders who had used that money that they had received to buy a few more goats. Their business trajectory would change. They would make a little bit more money  their standard of living would shift and would get better. And they would make really interesting little adjustments in their lives  like they would start to send their children to school. They might be able to buy mosquito nets. Maybe they could afford a lock for the door and feel secure. Maybe it was just that they could put sugar in their tea and offer that to me when I came as their guest and that made them feel proud. But there were these beautiful details  even if I talked to    goat herders in a row  and some days that's what happened    these beautiful details of life change that were meaningful to them. That was another thing that really touched me. It was really humbling to see for the first time  to really understand that even if I could have taken a magic wand and fixed everything  I probably would have gotten a lot wrong. Because the best way for people to change their lives is for them to have control and to do that in a way that they believe is best for them. So I saw that and it was very humbling. Anyway  another interesting thing happened while I was there. I never once was asked for a donation  which had kind of been my mode  right. There's poverty  you give money to help    no one asked me for a donation. In fact  no one wanted me to feel bad for them at all. If anything  they just wanted to be able to do more of what they were doing already and to build on their own capabilities. So what I did hear  once in a while  was that people wanted a loan    I thought that sounded very reasonable and really exciting. And by the way  I was a philosophy and poetry major in school  so I didn't know the difference between profit and revenue when I went to East Africa. I just got this impression that the money would work. And my introduction to business was in these      little infuses of capital. And I learned about profit and revenue  about leverage  all sorts of things  from farmers  from seamstresses  from goat herders. So this idea that these new stories of business and hope might be shared with my friends and family  and through that  maybe we could get some of the money that they needed to be able to continue their businesses as loans  that's this little idea that turned into Kiva. A few months later  I went back to Uganda with a digital camera and a basic website that my partner  Matthew  and I had kind of built  and took pictures of seven of my new friends  posted their stories  these stories of entrepreneurship  up on the website  spammed friends and family and said   We think this is legal. Haven't heard back yet from SEC on all the details  but do you say  do you want to help participate in this  provide the money that they need   The money came in basically overnight. We sent it over to Uganda. And over the next six months  a beautiful thing happened  the entrepreneurs received the money  they were paid  and their businesses  in fact  grew  and they were able to support themselves and change the trajectory of their lives. In October of '    after those first seven loans were paid  Matt and I took the word beta off of the site. We said   Our little experiment has been a success. Let's start for real.  That was our official launch. And then that first year  October '   through '    Kiva facilitated          in loans. The second year  it was a total of    million. The third year  the total was up to around   . The fourth year  we were just short of    . And today  less than five years in  Kiva's facilitated more than     million dollars  in little    dollar bits  from lenders and entrepreneurs    more than a million of those  collectively in     countries. So that's where Kiva is today  just to bring you right up to the present. And while those numbers and those statistics are really fun to talk about and they're interesting  to me  Kiva's really about stories. It's about retelling the story of the poor  and it's about giving ourselves an opportunity to engage that validates their dignity  validates a partnership relationship  not a relationship that's based on the traditional sort of donor beneficiary weirdness that can happen. But instead a relationship that can promote respect and hope and this optimism that together we can move forward. So what I hope is that  not only can the money keep flowing forth through Kiva    that's a very positive and meaningful thing    but I hope Kiva can blur those lines  like I said  between the traditional rich and poor categories that we're taught to see in the world  this false dichotomy of us and them  have and have not. I hope that Kiva can blur those lines. Because as that happens  I think we can feel free to interact in a way that's more open  more just and more creative  to engage with each other and to help each other. Imagine how you feel when you see somebody on street who is begging and you're about to approach them. Imagine how you feel  and then imagine the difference when you might see somebody who has a story of entrepreneurship and hard work who wants to tell you about their business. Maybe they're smiling  and they want to talk to you about what they've done. Imagine if you're speaking with somebody who's growing things and making them flourish  somebody who's using their talents to do something productive  somebody who's built their own business from scratch  someone who is surrounded by abundance  not scarcity  who's in fact creating abundance  somebody with full hands with something to offer  not empty hands asking for you to give them something. Imagine if you could hear a story you didn't expect of somebody who wakes up every day and works very  very hard to make their life better. These stories can really change the way that we think about each other. And if we can catalyze a supportive community to come around these individuals and to participate in their story by lending a little bit of money  I think that can change the way we believe in each other and each other's potential. Now for me  Kiva is just the beginning. And as I look forward to what is next  it's been helpful to reflect on the things I've learned so far. The first one is  as I mentioned  entrepreneurship was a new idea to me. Kiva borrowers  as I interviewed them and got to know them over the last few years  have taught me what entrepreneurship is. And I think  at its core  it's deciding that you want your life to be better. You see an opportunity and you decide what you're going to do to try to seize that. In short  it's deciding that tomorrow can better than today and going after that. Second thing that I've learned is that loans are a very interesting tool for connectivity. So they're not a donation. Yeah  maybe it doesn't sound that much different. But in fact  when you give something to someone and they say   Thanks   and let you know how things go  that's one thing. When you lend them money  and they slowly pay you back over time  you have this excuse to have an ongoing dialogue. This continued attention    this ongoing attention    is a really big deal to build different kinds of relationships among us. And then third  from what I've heard from the entrepreneurs I've gotten to know  when all else is equal  given the option to have just money to do what you need to do  or money plus the support and encouragement of a global community  people choose the community plus the money. That's a much more meaningful combination  a more powerful combination. So with that in mind  this particular incident has led to the things that I'm working on now. I see entrepreneurs everywhere now  now that I'm tuned into this. And one thing that I've seen is there are a lot of supportive communities that already exist in the world. With social networks  it's an amazing way  growing the number of people that we all have around us in our own supportive communities  rapidly. And so  as I have been thinking about this  I've been wondering  how can we engage these supportive communities to catalyze even more entrepreneurial ideas and to catalyze all of us to make tomorrow better than today  As I've researched what's going on in the United States  a few interesting little insights have come up. So one is that  of course  as we all might expect  many small businesses in the U.S. and all over the world still need money to grow and to do more of what they want to do or they might need money during a hard month. But there's always a need for resources close by. Another thing is  it turns out  those resources don't usually come from the places you might expect    banks  venture capitalists  other organizations and support structures    they come from friends and family. Some statistics say    percent or more of funding for small businesses comes from friends and family. That's around     billion dollars a year    it's a lot. And third  so as people are doing this friends and family fundraising process  it's very awkward  people don't know exactly what to ask for  how to ask  what to promise in return  even though they have the best of intentions and want to thank those people that are supporting them. So to harness the power of these supportive communities in a new way and to allow entrepreneurs to decide for themselves exactly what that financial exchange should look like  exactly what fits them and the people around them  this week actually  we're quietly doing a launch of Profounder  which is a crowd funding platform for small businesses to raise what they need through investments from their friends and family. And it's investments  not donations  not loans  but investments that have a dynamic return. So the mapping of participating in the story  it actually flows with the up and down. So in short  it's a do it yourself tool for small businesses to raise these funds. And what you can do is go onto the site  create a profile  create investment terms in a really easy way. We make it really  really simple for me as well as anyone else who wants to use the site. And we allow entrepreneurs to share a percentage of their revenues. They can raise up to a million dollars from an unlimited number of unaccredited  unsophisticated investors    everyday people  heaven forbid    and they can share those returns over time    again  whatever terms they set. As investors choose to become involved based on those terms  they can either take their rewards back as cash  or they can decide in advance to give those returns away to a non profit. So they can be a cash  or a cause  investor. It's my hope that this kind of tool can show anybody who has an idea a path to go do what they want to do in the world and to gather the people around them that they already have  the people that know them best and that love them and want to support them  to gather them to make this happen. So that's what I'm working on now. And to close  I just want to say  look these are tools. Right now  Profounder's right at the very beginning  and it's very palpable  it's very clear to me  that it's just a vessel  it's just a tool. What we need are for people to care  to actually go use it  just like they've cared enough to use Kiva to make those connections. But the good news is I don't think I need to stand here and convince you to care    I'm not even going to try. I don't think  even though we often hear  you know  hear the ethical and moral reasons  the religious reasons   Here's why caring and giving will make you happier.  I don't think we need to be convinced of that. I think we know  in fact  I think we know so much  and it's such a reality that we care so deeply  that in fact  what usually stops us is that we're afraid to try and to mess up  because we care so very much about helping each other and being meaningful in each other's lives. So what I think I can do today  that best thing I can give you    I've given you my story  which is the best I can do. And I think I can remind us that we do care. I think we all already know that. And I think we know that love is resilient enough for us to get out there and try. Just a sec. Thanks. Thanks. For me  the best way to be inspired to try is to stop and to listen to someone else's story. And I'm grateful that I've gotten to do that here at TED. And I'm grateful that whenever I do that  guaranteed  I am inspired    I am inspired by the person I am listening to. And I believe more and more every time I listen in that that person's potential to do great things in the world and in my own potential to maybe help. And that    forget the tools  forget the moving around of resources    that stuff's easy. Believing in each other  really being sure when push comes to shove that each one of us can do amazing things in the world  that is what can make our stories into love stories and our collective story into one that continually perpetuates hope and good things for all of us. So that  this belief in each other  knowing that without a doubt and practicing that every day in whatever you do  that's what I believe will change the world and make tomorrow better than today. Thank you. This technology made a very important impact on us. It changed the way our history developed. But it's a technology so pervasive  so invisible  that we  for a long time  forgot to take it into account when we talked about human evolution. But we see the results of this technology  still. So let's make a little test. So everyone of you turns to their neighbor please. Turn and face your neighbors. Please  also on the balcony. Smile. Smile. Open the mouths. Smile  friendly. Do you    Do you see any Canine teeth  Count Dracula teeth in the mouths of your neighbors  Of course not. Because our dental anatomy is actually made  not for tearing down raw meat from bones or chewing fibrous leaves for hours. It is made for a diet which is soft  mushy  which is reduced in fibers  which is very easily chewable and digestible. Sounds like fast food  doesn't it. It's for cooked food. We carry in our face the proof that cooking  food transformation  made us what we are. So I would suggest that we change how we classify ourselves. We talk about ourselves as omnivores. I would say  we should call ourselves coctivors    from coquere  to cook. We are the animals who eat cooked food. No  no  no  no. Better    to live of cooked food. So cooking is a very important technology. It's technology. I don't know how you feel  but I like to cook for entertainment. And you need some design to be successful. So  cooking is a very important technology  because it allowed us to acquire what brought you all here  the big brain  this wonderful cerebral cortex we have. Because brains are expensive. Those have to pay tuition fees know. But it's also  metabolically speaking  expensive. You now  our brain is two to three percent of the body mass  but actually it uses    percent of the total energy we use. It's very expensive. Where does the energy come from. Of course  from food. If we eat raw food  we cannot release really the energy. So this ingenuity of our ancestors  to invent this most marvelous technology. Invisible    everyone of us does it every day  so to speak. Cooking made it possible that mutations  natural selections  our environment  could develop us. So if we think about this unleashing human potential  which was possible by cooking and food  why do we talk so badly about food  Why is it always do and don'ts and it's good for you  it's not good for you  I think the good news for me would be if we could go back and talk about the unleashing  the continuation of the unleashing of human potential. Now  cooking allowed also that we became a migrant species. We walked out of Africa two times. We populated all the ecologies. If you can cook  nothing can happen to you  because whatever you find  you will try to transform it. It keeps also your brain working. Now the very easy and simple technology which was developed actually runs after this formula. Take something which looks like food  transform it  and it gives you a good  very easy  accessible energy. This technology affected two organs  the brain and the gut  which it actually affected. The brain could grow  but the gut actually shrunk. Okay  it's not obvious to be honest. But it shrunk to    percent of primate gut of my body mass. So because of having cooked food  it's easier to digest. Now having a large brain  as you know  is a big advantage  because you can actually influence your environment. You can influence your own technologies you have invented. You can continue to innovate and invent. Now the big brain did this also with cooking. But how did it actually run this show  How did it actually interfere  What kind of criteria did it use  And this is actually taste reward and energy. You know we have up to five tastes  three of them sustain us. Sweet    energy. Umami    this is a meaty taste. You need proteins for muscles  recovery. Salty  because you need salt  otherwise your electric body will not work. And two tastes which protect you    bitter and sour  which are against poisonous and rotten material. But of course  they are hard wired but we use them still in a sophisticated way. Think about bittersweet chocolate  or think about the acidity of yogurt    wonderful    mixed with strawberry fruits. So we can make mixtures of all this kind of thing because we know that  in cooking  we can transform it to the form. Reward  this is a more complex and especially integrative form of our brain with various different elements    the external states  our internal states  how do we feel  and so on are put together. And something which maybe you don't like but you are so hungry that you really will be satisfied to eat. So satisfaction was a very important part. And as I say  energy was necessary. Now how did the gut actually participate in this development  And the gut is a silent voice    it's going more for feelings. I use the euphemism digestive comfort    actually    it's a digestive discomfort  which the gut is concerned with. If you get a stomach ache  if you get a little bit bloated  was not the right food  was not the right cooking manipulation or maybe other things went wrong. So my story is a tale of two brains  because it might surprise you  our gut has a full fledged brain. All the managers in the room say   You don't tell me something new  because we know  gut feeling. This is what we are using.  And actually you use it and it's actually useful. Because our gut is connected to our emotional limbic system  they do speak with each other and make decisions. But what it means to have a brain there is that  not only the big brain has to talk with the food  the food has to talk with the brain  because we have to learn actually how to talk to the brains. Now if there's a gut brain  we should also learn to talk with this brain. Now     years ago  anatomists described very  very carefully    here is a model of a wall of a gut. I took the three elements    stomach  small intestine and colon. And within this structure  you see these two pinkish layers  which are actually the muscle. And between this muscle  they found nervous tissues  a lot of nervous tissues  which penetrate actually the muscle    penetrate the submucosa  where you have all the elements for the immune system. The gut is actually the largest immune system  defending your body. It penetrates the mucosa. This is the layer which actually touches the food you are swallowing and you digest  which is actually the lumen. Now if you think about the gut  the gut is    if you could stretch it       meters long  the length of a tennis court. If we could unroll it  get out all the folds and so on  it would have     sq. meters of surface. And now this brain takes care over this  to move it with the muscles and to do defend the surface and  of course  digest our food we cook. So if we give you a specification  this brain  which is autonomous  have     million nerve cells      million neurons    so around the size of a cat brain  so there sleeps a little cat    thinks for itself  optimizes whatever it digests. It has    different neuron types. It's got the same diversity you find actually in a pig brain  where you have     billion neurons. It has autonomous organized microcircuits  has these programs which run. It senses the food  it knows exactly what to do. It senses it by chemical means and very importantly by mechanical means  because it has to move the food    it has to mix all the various elements which we need for digestion. This control of muscle is very  very important  because  you know  there can be reflexes. If you don't like a food  especially if you're a child  you gag. It's this brain which makes this reflex. And then finally  it controls also the secretion of this molecular machinery  which actually digests the food we cook. Now how do the two brains work with each other  I took here a model from robotics    it's called the Subsumption Architecture. What it means is that we have a layered control system. The lower layer  our gut brain  has its own goals    digestion defense    and we have the higher brain with the goal of integration and generating behaviors. Now both look    and this is the blue arrows    both look to the same food  which is in the lumen and in the area of your intestine. The big brain integrates signals  which come from the running programs of the lower brain  But subsumption means that the higher brain can interfere with the lower. It can replace  or it can inhibit actually  signals. So if we take two types of signals    a hunger signal for example. If you have an empty stomach  your stomach produces a hormone called ghrelin. It's a very big signal  it's sent to the brain says   Go and eat.  You have stop signals    we have up to eight stop signals. At least in my case  they are not listened to. So what happens if the big brain in the integration overrides the signal  So if you override the hunger signal  you can have a disorder  which is called anorexia. Despite generating a healthy hunger signal  the big brain ignores it and activates different programs in the gut. The more usual case is overeating. It actually takes the signal and changes it  and we continue  even  though  our eight signals would say   Stop  enough. We have transferred enough energy.  Now the interesting thing is that  along this lower layer    this gut    the signal becomes stronger and stronger if undigested  but digestible  material could penetrate. This we found from bariatric surgery. That then the signal would be very  very high. So now back to the cooking question and back to the design. We have learned to talk to the big brain    taste and reward  as you know. Now what would be the language we have to talk to the gut brain that its signals are so strong that the big brain cannot ignore it  Then we would generate something all of us would like to have    a balance between the hunger and the satiation. Now I give you  from our research  a very short claim. This is fat digestion. You have on your left an olive oil droplet  and this olive oil droplet gets attacked by enzymes. This is an in vitro experiment. It's very difficult to work in the intestine. Now everyone would expect that when the degradation of the oil happens  when the constituents are liberated  they disappear  they go away because they  were  absorbed. Actually  what happens is that a very intricate structure appears. And I hope you can see that there are some ring like structures in the middle image  which is water. This whole system generates a huge surface to allow more enzymes to attack the remaining oil. And finally  on your right side  you see a bubbly  cell like structure appearing  from which the body will absorb the fat. Now if we could take this language    and this is a language of structures    and make it longer lasting  that it can go through the passage of the intestine  it would generate stronger signals. So our research    and I think the research also at the universities    are now fixing on these points to say  how can we actually    and this might sound trivial now to you    how can we change cooking  How can we cook that we have this language developed  So what we have actually  it's not an omnivore's dilemma. We have a coctivor's opportunity  because we have learned over the last two million years which taste and reward    quite sophisticated to cook    to please ourselves  to satisfy ourselves. If we add the matrix  if we add the structure language  which we have to learn  when we learn it  then we can put it back  and around energy  we could generate a balance  which comes out from our really primordial operation  cooking. So  to make cooking really a very important element  I would say even philosophers have to change and have to finally recognize that cooking is what made us. So I would say  coquo ergo sum  I cook  therefore I am. Thank you very much. I'm a visual artist  and I'm also one of the co founders of the Plastic Pollution Coalition. I've been working with plastic bags  which I cut up and sew back together as my primary material for my artwork for the last    years. I turn them into two and three dimensional pieces and sculptures and installations. Upon working with the plastic  after about the first eight years  some of my work started to fissure and break down into smaller little bits of plastic. And I thought   Great. It's ephemeral just like us.  Upon educating myself a little further about plastics  I actually realized this was a bad thing. It's a bad thing that plastic breaks down into smaller little bits  because it's always still plastic. And what we're finding is that a lot of it is in the marine environment. I then  in the last few years  learned about the Pacific garbage patch and the gyre. And my initial reaction    and I think this is a lot of people's first reaction to learning about it    is   Oh my God  We've got to go out there and clean this thing up.  So I actually developed a proposal to go out with a cargo ship and two decommissioned fishing trawlers  a crane  a chipping machine and a cold molding machine. And my intention was to go out to the gyre  raise awareness about this issue and begin to pick up the plastic  chip it into little bits and cold mold it into bricks that could potentially be used as building materials in underdeveloped communities. I began talking with people who actually had been out to the gyre and were studying the plastic problem in the marine environment and upon doing so  I realized actually that cleaning it up would be a very small drop in the bucket relative to how much is being generated every day around the world  and that actually I needed to back up and look at the bigger picture. And the bigger picture is  we need to find a way to turn off the faucet. We need to cut the spigot of single use and disposable plastics  which are entering the marine environment every day on a global scale. So in looking at that  I also realized that I was really angry. I wasn't just concerned about plastic that you're trying to imagine out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean    of which I have learned there are now    gyres  potentially  of plastic in five major oceans in the world. It's not just that gyre of plastic that I'm concerned about    it's the gyre of plastic in the supermarket. I'd go to the supermarket and all of my food is packaged in plastic. All of my beverages are packaged in plastic  even at the health food market. I'm also concerned about the plastic in the refrigerator  and I'm concerned about the plastic and the toxins that leach from plastic into us and into our bodies. So I came together with a group of other people who were all looking at this issue  and we created the Plastic Pollution Coalition. We have many initiatives that we're working on  but some of them are very basic. One is  if    to    percent of what we're finding in the ocean    of the marine debris that we're finding in the ocean    is plastic  then why don't we call it what it is. It's plastic pollution. Recycling    everybody kind of ends their books about being sustainable and greening with the idea of recycling. You put something in a bin and you don't have to think about it again. What is the reality of that  In the United States  less than seven percent of our plastics are recycled. And if you really look into it  particularly when it comes to plastic bottles  most of it is only down cycled  or incinerated  or shipped to China. It is down cycled and turned into lesser things  while a glass bottle can be a glass bottle again or can be used again    a plastic bottle can never be a plastic bottle again. So this is a big issue for us. Another thing that we're looking at and asking people to think about is we've added a fourth R onto the front of the  Reduce  Reuse  Recycle   three R's  and that is refuse. Whenever possible  refuse single use and disposable plastics. Alternatives exist  some of them are very old school. I myself am now collecting these cool Pyrex containers and using those instead of Glad and Tupperware containers to store food in. And I know that I am doing a service to myself and my family. It's very easy to pick up a stainless steel bottle or a glass bottle  if you're traveling and you've forgotten to bring your stainless steel bottle and fill that up with water or filtered water  versus purchasing plastic bottled water. I guess what I want to say to everybody here    and I know that you guys know a lot about this issue    is that this is a huge problem in the oceans  but this is a problem that we've created as consumers and we can solve. We can solve this by raising awareness of the issue and teaching people to choose alternatives. So whenever possible  to choose alternatives to single use plastics. We can cut the stem    tide the stem of this into our oceans and in doing so  save our oceans  save our planet  save ourselves. Thank you.  Applause  So yeah  I'm a newspaper cartoonist    political cartoonist. I don't know if you've heard about it    newspapers  It's a sort of paper based reader. It's lighter than an iPad  it's a bit cheaper. You know what they say  They say the print media is dying    who says that  Well  the media. But this is no news  right  You've read about it already. Ladies and gentlemen  the world has gotten smaller. I know it's a cliche  but look  look how small  how tiny it has gotten. And you know the reason why  of course. This is because of technology    yeah. Any computer designers in the room  Yeah well  you guys are making my life miserable because track pads used to be round  a nice round shape. That makes a good cartoon. But what are you going to do with a flat track pad  those square things  There's nothing I can do as a cartoonist. Well  I know the world is flat now. That's true. And the Internet has reached every corner of the world  the poorest  the remotest places. Every village in Africa now has a cyber cafe. Don't go asking for a Frappuccino there. So we are bridging the digital divide. The Third World is connected  we are connected. And what happens next  Well  you've got mail. Yeah. Well  the Internet has empowered us. It has empowered you  it has empowered me and it has empowered some other guys as well. You know  these last two cartoons    I did them live during a conference in Hanoi. And they were not used to that in communist  .  Vietnam. So I was cartooning live on a wide screen    it was quite a sensation    and then this guy came to me. He was taking pictures of me and of my sketches  and I thought   This is great  a Vietnamese fan.  And as he came the second day  I thought   Wow  that's really a cartoon lover.  And on the third day  I finally understood  the guy was actually on duty. So by now  there must be a hundred pictures of me smiling with my sketches in the files of the Vietnamese police. No  but it's true  the Internet has changed the world. It has rocked the music industry  it has changed the way we consume music. For those of you old enough to remember  we used to have to go to the store to steal it. And it has changed the way your future employer will look at your application. So be careful with that Facebook account    your momma told you  be careful. And technology has set us free    this is free WiFi. But yeah  it has liberated us from the office desk. This is your life  enjoy it. In short  technology  the internet  they have changed our lifestyle. Tech guru  like this man    that a German magazine called the philosopher of the   st century    they are shaping the way we do things. They are shaping the way we consume. They are shaping our very desires. You will not like it. And technology has even changed our relationship to God. Now I shouldn't get into this. Religion and political cartoons  as you may have heard  make a difficult couple  ever since that day of       when a bunch of cartoonists in Denmark drew cartoons that had repercussions all over the world    demonstrations  fatwa  they provoked violence. People died in the violence. This was so sickening  people died because of cartoons. I mean    I had the feeling at the time that cartoons had been used by both sides  actually. They were used first by a Danish newspaper  which wanted to make a point on Islam. A Danish cartoonist told me he was one of the    who received the assignment to draw the prophet       of them refused. Did you know that  He told me   Nobody has to tell me what I should draw. This is not how it works.  And then  of course  they were used by extremists and politicians on the other side. They wanted to stir up controversy. You know the story. We know that cartoons can be used as weapons. History tells us  they've been used by the Nazis to attack the Jews. And here we are now. In the United Nations  half of the world is pushing to penalize the offense to religion    they call it the defamation of religion    while the other half of the world is fighting back in defense of freedom of speech. So the clash of civilizations is here  and cartoons are at the middle of it  This got me thinking. Now you see me thinking at my kitchen table  and since you're in my kitchen  please meet my wife. In       a few months after  I went Ivory Coast    Western Africa. Now  talk of a divided place    the country was cut in two. You had a rebellion in the North  the government in the South    the capital  Abidjan    and in the middle  the French army. This looks like a giant hamburger. You don't want to be the ham in the middle. I was there to report on that story in cartoons. I've been doing this for the last    years  it's my side job  if you want. So you see the style is different. This is more serious than maybe editorial cartooning. I went to places like Gaza during the war in     . So this is really journalism in cartoons. You'll hear more and more about it. This is the future of journalism  I think. And of course  I went to see the rebels in the north. Those were poor guys fighting for their rights. There was an ethnic side to this conflict as very often in Africa. And I went to see the Dozo. The Dozo  they are the traditional hunters of West Africa. People fear them    they help the rebellion a lot. They are believed to have magical powers. They can disappear and escape bullets. I went to see a Dozo chief  he told me about his magical powers. He said   I can chop your head off right away and bring you back to life.  I said   Well  maybe we don't have time for this right now.   Another time.  So back in Abidjan  I was given a chance to lead a workshop with local cartoonists there and I thought  yes  in a context like this  cartoons can really be used as weapons against the other side. I mean  the press in Ivory Coast was bitterly divided    it was compared to the media in Rwanda before the genocide    so imagine. And what can a cartoonist do  Sometimes editors would tell their cartoonists to draw what they wanted to see  and the guy has to feed his family  right  So the idea was pretty simple. We brought together cartoonists from all sides in Ivory Coast. We took them away from their newspaper for three days. And I asked them to do a project together  tackle the issues affecting their country in cartoons  yes  in cartoons. Show the positive power of cartoons. It's a great tool of communication for bad or for good. And cartoons can cross boundaries  as you have seen. And humor is a good way  I think  to address serious issues. And I'm very proud of what they did. I mean  they didn't agree with each other    that was not the point. And I didn't ask them to do nice cartoons. The first day  they were even shouting at each other. But they came up with a book  looking back at    years of political crisis in Ivory Coast. So the idea was there. And I've been doing projects like this  in      in Lebanon  this year in Kenya  back in January. In Lebanon  it was not a book. The idea was to have    the same principal  a divided country    take cartoonists from all sides and let them do something together. So in Lebanon  we enrolled the newspaper editors  and we got them to publish eight cartoonists from all sides all together on the same page  addressing the issue affecting Lebanon  like religion in politics and everyday life. And it worked. For three days  almost all the newspapers of Beirut published all those cartoonists together    anti government  pro government  Christian  Muslim  of course  English speaking  well  you name it. So this was a great project. And then in Kenya  what we did was addressing the issue of ethnicity  which is a poison in a lot of places in Africa. And we did video clips    you can see them if you go to YouTube Kenyatoons. So  preaching for freedom of speech is easy here  but as you have seen in contexts of repression or division  again  what can a cartoonist do  He has to keep his job. Well I believe that in any context anywhere  he always has the choice at least not to do a cartoon that will feed hatred. And that's the message I try to convey to them. I think we all always have the choice in the end not to do the bad thing. But we need to support these  unclear   critical and responsible voices in Africa  in Lebanon  in your local newspaper  in the Apple store. Today  tech companies are the world's largest editors. They decide what is too offensive or too provocative for you to see. So really  it's not about the freedom of cartoonists  it's about your freedoms. And for dictators all over the world  the good news is when cartoonists  journalists and activists shut up. Thank you. The big residual is always value for money. All the time we are trying to get value for money. What we don't look for is value for many  while we are generating value for money. Do we care about those four billion people whose income levels are less than two dollars a day  the so called bottom of the pyramid  What are the challenges in getting value for money as well as value for many  We have described here in terms of the performance and the price. If you have money  of course  you can get the value. You can get a Mercedes for a very high price  very high performance. But if you don't have money  what happens  Well  you are to ride a bicycle  carrying your own weight and also some other weight  so that you can earn the bread for the day. Well  poor do not remain poor  they become lower middle class. And if they do so  then  of course  the conditions improve  and they start riding on scooters. But the challenge is  again  they don't get much value  because they can't afford anything more than the scooter. The issue is  at that price  can you give them some extra value  A super value  in terms of their ability to ride in a car  to get that dignity  to get that safety  looks practically impossible  isn't it. Now  this is something that we see on Indian streets all the time. But many people see the same thing and think things differently  and one of them is here  Ratan Tata. The great thing about our leaders is that  should they not only have passion in their belly  which practically all of them have  they're also very innovative. An innovator is one who does not know it cannot be done. They believe that things can be done. But great leaders like Ratan have compassion. And what you said  Lakshmi  is absolutely true  it's not just Ratan Tata  it's the house of Tatas over time. Let me confirm what she said. Yes  I went barefoot until I was   . I struggled to  unclear  day was a huge issue. And when I finished my SSC  the eleventh standard  I stood eleventh among         students. But I was about to leave the school  because my poor mother couldn't afford schooling. And it was  unclear  Tata Trust  which gave me six rupees per month  almost a dollar per month for six years. That's how I'm standing before you. So that is the House of Tata. Innovation  compassion and passion. They combine all that. And it was that compassion which bothered them  because when he saw    in fact  he told me about eight or nine years ago how he was driving his own car    he drives his own car by the way    and he saw in the rain  a family like the one that I showed to you getting drenched with an infant. And then he said   Well  I must give them a car that they can afford  one lakh car         car.  Of course  as soon as you say something like this people say it is impossible  and that's what was said by Suzuki. He said  oh  probably he is going to build a three wheeler with stepney. And you can see the cartoon here. Well they didn't build that. They built a proper car. Nano. And mind you  I'm six feet half an inch  Ratan is taller than me  and we have ample space in the front and ample space in the back in this particular car. And incredible car. And of course  nothing succeeds like success  the cynics then turned around  and one after the other they also started saying   Yes  we also want to make a car in the Nano Segment. We'll manufacture a car in the Nano Segment.  How did this great story unfold  the making of Nano  Let me tell you a bit about it. For example  how we started  Ratan just began with a five engineer team  young people in their mid twenties. And he said   Well  I won't define the vehicle for you  but I will define the cost for you. It is one lakh          rupees  and you are to make it within that.  And he told them   Question the unquestionable. Stretch the envelope.  And at a point in time  he got so engrossed in the whole challenge  that he himself became a member of the team. Can you believe it  I still am told about this story of that single wiper design in which he participated. Until midnight  he'd be thinking. Early morning he'll be coming back with sort of solutions. But who was the team leader  The team leader was Girish Wagh  a    year old boy in  unclear . And the Nano team average age was just    years. And they did innovation in design and beyond. Broke many norms of the standard conventions for the first time. For example  that a two cylinder gas engine was used in a car with a single balancer shaft. Adhesives were replacing the rivets. There was a co creation  a huge co creation  with vendors and suppliers. All ideas on board were welcome.     vendors were co located adjacent to the plant  and innovative business models for automobile dealerships were developed. Imagine that a fellow who sells cloth  for example  will be selling Nano. I mean  it was incredible innovation. Seeking solutions for non auto sectors. It was an open innovation  ideas from all over were welcome. The mechanism of helicopters seats and windows was used  by the way  as well as a dashboard that was inspired by two wheelers. The fuel lines and lamps were as in two wheelers. And the crux of the matter was  however  getting more from less. All the time  you have been given an envelope. You can't cross that envelope  which is         rupees        dollars. And therefore  each component had to have a dual functionality. And the seat riser  for example  serving as a mounting for the seat as well as a structural part of the functional rigidity. Half the number of parts are contained in Nano in comparison to a typical passenger car. The length is smaller by eight percent by the way. But the current entry level cars in comparison to that is eight percent less  but    percent more inside space. And what happened was that    more from less    you can see how much more for how much less. When the Model T was launched    and this is  by the way  all the figures that are adjusted to      dollar prices    Model T was        by Ford. Volkswagon was       . And British Motor was around       . And Nano was  bang        dollars. This is why you started actually a new paradigm shift  where the same people who could not dream of sitting in a car  who were carrying their entire family in a scooter  started dreaming of being in a car. And those dreams are getting fulfilled. This is a photograph of a house and a driver and a car near my own home. The driver's name is Naran. He has bought his own Nano. And you can see  there is a physical space that has been created for him  parking that car  along with the owner's car  but more importantly  they've created a space in their mind that  Yes  my chauffeur is going to come in his own car and park it.  And that's why I call it a transformational innovation. It is not just technological  it is social innovation that we talk about. And that is where  ladies and gentlemen  this famous theme of getting more from less for more becomes important. I remember talking about this for the first time in Australia  about one and a half years ago  when their academy honored me with a fellowship. And unbelievably  in    years  I was the first Indian to be honored. And the title of my talk was therefore  Indian innovation from Gandhi to Gandhian engineering.  And I titled this more from less for more and more people as Gandhian engineering. And Gandhian engineering  in my judgment  is the one which is going to take the world forward  is going to make a difference  not just for a few  but for everyone. Let me move from mobility in a car to individual mobility for those unfortunates who have lost their legs. Here is an American citizen and his son having an artificial foot. What is its price         dollars. And of course  these feet are so designed that they can walk only on such perfect pavement or roads. Unfortunately  that's not the case in India. You can see him walk barefoot on an awkward land  sometimes in a marshy land  and so on and so forth. More importantly  they not only walk far to work  and not only do they cycle to work  but they cycle for work  as you can see here. And they climb up for their work. You have to design an artificial foot for such conditions. A challenge  of course. Four billion people  their incomes are less then two dollars a day. And if you talk about a        dollar shoe  you're talking about        days of income. You just don't have it. And therefore  you ought to look at alternatives. And that is how Jaipur Foot was created in India. It had a revolutionary prosthetic fitment and delivery system  a quick molding and modular components  enabling custom made  on the spot limb fitments. You could feel it actually in an hour  by the way  whereas the equivalent other feet took something like a day  as so on. Outer socket made by using heated high density polyethylene pipes  rather than using heated sheets. And unique high ankle design and human like looks   unclear  and functions. And I like to show how it looks and how it works. See  he jumps. You can see what stress it must have. ... above the limb  yes  it would be difficult ...  Did it hurt    No ... not at all.  ... he can run a kilometer in four minutes and    seconds ...  One kilometer in four minutes and    seconds. So that's what it is all about. And therefore Time took notice of this    dollar foot  basically. An incredible story. Let's move on to something else. I've been talking about getting more from less for more. Let's move to health. We've talked about mobility and the rest of it  let's talk about health. What's happening in the area of health  You know  you have new diseases that require new drugs. And if you look at the drug development    years ago and now  what has happened     years ago  it used to cost about a quarter billion. Today it costs  .  billion dollars. Time taken for moving a molecule to marketplace  after all the human and animal testing  was    years  now it is    years. Are you getting more drugs because you are spending more time and more money  No  I'm sorry. We used to have     now they have come down to   . So actually we are getting less from more for less and less people. Why less and less people  Because it is so expensive  so very few will be able to basically afford that. Let us just take an example. Psoriasis is very dreadful disease of the skin. The cost of treatment         dollars.       dollar antibody injections under the skin  by the way  and    of them. Time for development    it took around    years and     million dollars. Let's start in the spirit of more from less and more for more and start putting some targets. For example  we don't want        dollars  we don't have it. Can we do it  for      dollars  Time for development  not    years. We are in a hurry. Five years. Cost of development        million dollars. Sorry. I can't spend more than    million dollars. Looks absolutely audacious. Looks absolutely ridiculous. You know something  This has been achieved in India. These targets have been achieved in India. And how they have been achieved ... Sir Francis Bacon once said   When you wish to achieve results that have not been achieved before  it is an unwise fancy to think that they can be achieved by using methods that have been used before.  And therefore  the standard process  where you develop a molecule  put it into mice  into men  are not yielding those results    the billions of dollars that have been spent. The Indian cleverness was using its traditional knowledge  however  scientifically validating it and making that journey from men to mice to men  not molecule to mice to men  you know. And that is how this difference has come. And you can see this blending of traditional medicine  modern medicine  modern science. I launched a big program  unclear  CSIR about nine years ago. He is giving us not just for Psoriasis  for cancer and a whole range of things  changing the whole paradigm. And you can see this Indian Psoriasis breakthrough obtained by this reverse form of  unclear  by doing things differently. You can see before treatment and after treatment. This is really getting more from less for more and more people  because these are all affordable treatments now. Let me just remind you of what Mahatma Gandhi had said. He had said   Earth provides enough to satisfy every man's need  but not every man's greed.  So the message he was giving us was you must get more from less and less and less so that you can share it for more and more people  not only the current generation  but the future generations. And he also said   I would prize every invention of science made for the benefit for all.  So he was giving you the message that you must have it for more and more people  not just a few people. And therefore  ladies and gentlemen  this is the theme  getting more from less for more. And mind you  it is not getting just a little more for just a little less. It's not about low cost. It's about ultra low cost. You cannot say it's a mere treatment        dollars  but because you are poor I'll give it for      . Sorry  it doesn't work. You have to give it for     dollars      dollars. Is it possible  It has been made possible  by the way  for certain other different reasons. So you are not talking about low cost  you are talking about ultra low cost. You are not talking about affordability  you are talking about extreme affordability. Because of the four billion people whose income is under two dollars a day. You're not talking exclusive innovation. You're talking about inclusive innovation. And therefore  you're not talking about incremental innovation  you're talking about disruptive innovation. The ideas have to be such that you think in completely different terms. And I would also add  it is not only getting more from less for more by more and more people  the whole world working for it. I was very touched when I saw a breakthrough the other day. You know  incubators for infants  for example. They're not available in Africa. They're not available in Indian villages. And infants die. And incubator costs       dollars. And there's a    dollar incubator giving that performance that had been created. And by whom  By young students from Standford University on an extreme affordability project that they had  basically. Their heart is in the right place  like Ratan Tata. It's not just innovation  compassion and passion    compassion in the heart and passion in the belly. That's the new world that we want to create. And that is why the message is that of Gandhian engineering. Ladies and gentlemen  I'd like to end before time. I was also afraid of those    minutes. I've still one and a half to go. The message  the final message  is this  India gave a great gift to the world. What was that   In the    th century  we gave Gandhi to the world. The   st century gift  which is very  very important for the whole world  whether it is global economic meltdown  whether it is climate change    any problem that you talk about is gaining more from less for more and more    not only the current generations  for the future generations. And that can come only from Gandhian engineering. So ladies and gentlemen  I'm very happy to announce  this gift of the   st century to the world from India  Gandhian engineering. Lakshmi Pratury  Thank you  Dr. Mashelkar.  R.A. Mashelkar  Thank you very much.  LP  A quick question for you. Now  when you were a young boy in this school  what were your thoughts  like what did you think you could become  What do you think that drove you  Was there a vision you had  What is it that drove you  RAM  I'll tell you a story that drove me  that transformed my life. I remember  I went to a poor school  because my mother could not gather the    rupees  that half a dollar that was required within the stipulated time. It was  unclear  high school. But it was a poor school with rich teachers  honestly. And one of them was  unclear  who taught us physics. One day he took us out into the sun and tried to show us how to find the focal length of a convex lens. The lens was here. The piece of paper was there. He moved it up and down. And there was a bright spot up there. And then he said   This is the focal length.  But then he held it for a little while  Lakshmi. And then the paper burned. When the paper burned  for some reason he turned to me  and he said   Mashelkar  like this  if you do not diffuse your energies  if you focus your energies  you can achieve anything in the world.  That gave me a great message  focus and you can achieve. I said   Whoa  science is so wonderful  I have to become a scientist.  But more importantly  focus and you can achieve. And that message  very frankly  is valuable for society today. What does that focal length do  It has parallel lines  which are sun rays. And the property of parallel lines is that they never meet. What does that convex lens do  It makes them meet. This is convex lens leadership. You know what today's leadership is doing  Concave length. They divide them farther. So I learned the lesson of convex lens leadership from that. And when I was at National Chemical Laboratory  unclear . When I was at Council of Scientific Industry Research       laboratories    when two laboratories were not talking to each other  I would  unclear . And currently I'm president of Global Research Alliance         scientists in nine counties  right from India to the U.S. I'm trying to build a global team  which will look at the global grand challenges that the world is facing. That was the lesson. That was the inspirational moment. LP  Thank you very much.  RAM  Thank you.  I'm going to talk to you about power in this   st century. And basically  what I'd like to tell you is that power is changing  and there are two types of changes I want to discuss. One is power transition  which is change of power amongst states. And there the simple version of the message is it's moving from West to East. The other is power diffusion  the way power is moving from all states West or East to non state actors. Those two things are the huge shifts of power in our century. And I want to tell you about them each separately and then how they interact and why  in the end  there may be some good news. When we talk about power transition  we often talk about the rise of Asia. It really should be called the recovery or return of Asia. If we looked at the world in       you'd find that more than half of the world's people lived in Asia and they made more than half the world's product. Now fast forward to       half the world's people    more than half    still live in Asia  but they're now making only a fifth of the world's product. What happened  The Industrial Revolution  which meant that all of a sudden  Europe and America became the dominant center of the world. What we're going to see in the   st century is Asia gradually returning to being more than half of the world's population and more than half of the world's product. That's important and it's an important shift. But let me tell you a little bit about the other shift that I'm talking about  which is power diffusion. To understand power diffusion put this in your mind  computing and communications costs have fallen a thousandfold between      and the beginning of this century. Now that's a big abstract number. But to make it more real  if the price of an automobile had fallen as rapidly as the price of computing power  you could buy a car today for five dollars. Now when the price of any technology declines that dramatically  the barriers to entry go down. Anybody can play in the game. So in       if you wanted to communicate from Oxford to Johannesburg to New Delhi to Brasilia and anywhere simultaneously  you could do it. The technology was there. But to be able to do it  you had to be very rich    a government  a multinational corporation  maybe the Catholic Church    but you had to be pretty wealthy. Now  anybody has that capacity  which previously was restricted by price just to a few actors. If they have the price of entry into an Internet cafe    the last time I looked  it was something like a pound an hour    and if you have Skype  it's free. So capabilities that were once restricted are now available to everyone. And what that means is not that the age of the State is over. The State still matters. But the stage is crowded. The State's not alone. There are many  many actors. Some of that's good  Oxfam  a great non governmental actor. Some of it's bad  Al Qaeda  another non governmental actor. But think of what it does to how we think in traditional terms and concepts. We think in terms of war and interstate war. And you can think back to      when the government of Japan attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor. It's worth noticing that a non state actor attacking the United States in      killed more Americans than the government of Japan did in     . You might think of that as the privatization of war. So we're seeing a great change in terms of diffusion of power. Now the problem is that we're not thinking about it in very innovative ways. So let me step back and ask  what's power  Power is simple the ability to affect others to get the outcomes you want  and you can do it in three ways. You can do it with threats of coercion   sticks   you can do it with payments   carrots   or you can do it by getting others to want what you want. And that ability to get others to want what you want  to get the outcomes you want without coercion or payment  is what I call soft power. And that soft power has been much neglected and much misunderstood  and yet it's tremendously important. Indeed  if you can learn to use more soft power  you can save a lot on carrots and sticks. Traditionally  the way people thought about power was primarily in terms of military power. For example  the great Oxford historian who taught here at this university  A.J.P. Taylor  defined a great power as a country able to prevail in war. But we need a new narrative if we're to understand power in the   st century. It's not just prevailing at war  though war still persists. It's not whose army wins  it's also whose story wins. And we have to think much more in terms of narratives and whose narrative is going to be effective. Now let me go back to the question of power transition between states and what's happening there. the narratives that we use now tend to be the rise and fall of the great powers. And the current narrative is all about the rise of China and the decline of the United States. Indeed  with the      financial crisis  many people said this was the beginning of the end of American power. The tectonic plates of world politics were shifting. And president Medvedev of Russia  for example  pronounced in      this was the beginning of the end of United States power. But in fact  this metaphor of decline is often very misleading. If you look at history  in recent history  you'll see the cycles of belief in American decline come and go every    or    years or so. In       after the Soviets put up Sputnik  it was  That's the end of America.  In       with the oil embargo and the closing of the gold window  that was the end of America. In the     s  as America went through a transition in the Reagan period  between the rust belt economy of the midwest to the Silicon Valley economy of California  that was the end of America. But in fact  what we've seen is none of those were true. Indeed  people were over enthusiastic in the early     s  thinking America could do anything  which led us into some disastrous foreign policy adventures  and now we're back to decline again. The moral of this story is all these narratives about rise and fall and decline tell us a lot more about psychology than they do about reality. If we try to focus on the reality  then what we need to focus on is what's really happening in terms of China and the United States. Goldman Sachs has projected that China  the Chinese economy  will surpass that of the U.S. by     . So we've got  what     more years to go or so before China's bigger. Now someday  with a billion point three people getting richer  they are going to be bigger than the United States. But be very careful about these projections such as the Goldman Sachs projection as though that gives you an accurate picture of power transition in this century. Let me mention three reasons why it's too simple. First of all  it's a linear projection. You know  everything says  here's the growth rate of China  here's the growth rate of the U.S.  here it goes    straight line. History is not linear. There are often bumps along the road  accidents along the way. The second thing is that the Chinese economy passes the U.S. economy in  let's say        which it may it  that will be a measure of total economic size  but not of per capita income    won't tell you about the composition of the economy. China still has large areas of underdevelopment and per capita income is a better measure of the sophistication of the economy. And that the Chinese won't catch up or pass the Americans until somewhere in the latter part  after       of this century. The other point that's worth noticing is how one dimensional this projection is. You know  it looks at economic power measured by GDP. Doesn't tell you much about military power  doesn't tell you very much about soft power. It's all very one dimensional. And also  when we think about the rise of Asia  or return of Asia as I called it a little bit earlier  it's worth remembering Asia's not one thing. If you're sitting in Japan  or in New Delhi  or in Hanoi  your view of the rise of China is a little different than if you're sitting in Beijing. Indeed  one of the advantages that the Americans will have in terms of power in Asia is all those countries want an American insurance policy against the rise of China. It's as though Mexico and Canada were hostile neighbors to the United States  which they're not. So these simple projections of the Goldman Sachs type are not telling us what we need to know about power transition. But you might ask  well so what in any case  Why does it matter  Who cares  Is this just a game that diplomats and academics play  The answer is it matters quite a lot. Because  if you believe in decline and you get the answers wrong on this  the facts  not the myths  you may have policies which are very dangerous. Let me give you an example from history. The Peloponnesian War was the great conflict in which the Greek city state system tore itself apart two and a half millennia ago. What caused it  Thucydides  the great historian of the the Peloponnesian War  said it was the rise in the power of Athens and the fear it created in Sparta. Notice both halves of that explanation. Many people argue that the   st century is going to repeat the   th century  in which World War One  the great conflagration in which the European state system tore itself apart and destroyed its centrality in the world  that that was caused by the rise in the power of Germany and the fear it created in Britain. So there are people who are telling us this is going to be reproduced today  that what we're going to see is the same thing now in this century. No  I think that's wrong. It's bad history. For one thing  Germany had surpassed Britain in industrial strength by     . And as I said earlier  China has not passed the United States. But also  if you have this belief and it creates a sense of fear  it leads to overreaction. And the greatest danger we have of managing this power transition of the shift toward the East is fear. To paraphrase Franklin Roosevelt from a different context  the greatest thing we have to fear is fear itself. We don't have to fear the rise of China or the return of Asia. And if we have policies in which we take it in that larger historical perspective  we're going to be able to manage this process. Let me say a word now about the distribution of power and how it relates to power diffusion and then pull these two types together. If you ask how is power distributed in the world today  it's distributed much like a three dimensional chess game. Top board  military power among states. The United States is the only superpower  and it's likely to remain that way for two or three decades. China's not going to replace the U.S. on this military board. Middle board of this three dimensional chess game  economic power among states. Power is multi polar. There are balancers    the U.S.  Europe  China  Japan can balance each other. The bottom board of this three dimensional  the board of transnational relations  things that cross borders outside the control of governments  things like climate change  drug trade  financial flows  pandemics  all these things that cross borders outside the control of governments  there nobody's in charge. It makes no sense to call this unipolar or multi polar. Power is chaotically distributed. And the only way you can solve these problems    and this is where many greatest challenges are coming in this century    is through cooperation  through working together  which means that soft power becomes more important  that ability to organize networks to deal with these kinds of problems and to be able to get cooperation. Another way of putting it is that as we think of power in the   st century  we want to get away from the idea that power's always zero sum    my gain is your loss and vice versa. Power can also be positive sum  where your gain can be my gain. If China develops greater energy security and greater capacity to deal with its problems of carbon emissions  that's good for us as well as good for China as well as good for everybody else. So empowering China to deal with its own problems of carbon is good for everybody  and it's not a zero sum  I win  you lose. It's one in which we can all gain. So as we think about power in this century  we want to get away from this view that it's all I win  you lose. Now I don't mean to be Pollyannaish about this. Wars persist. Power persists. Military power is important. Keeping balances is important. All this still persists. Hard power is there  and it will remain. But unless you learn how to mix hard power with soft power into strategies that I call smart power  you're not going to deal with the new kinds of problems that we're facing. So the key question that we need to think about as we look at this is how do we work together to produce global public goods  things from which all of us can benefit  How do we define our national interests so that it's not just zero sum  but positive sum. In that sense  if we define our interests  for example  for the United States the way Britain defined its interests in the   th century  keeping an open trading system  keeping a monetary stability  keeping freedom of the seas    those were good for Britain  they were good for others as well. And in the   st century  you have to do an analog to that. How do we produce global public goods  which are good for us  but good for everyone at the same time  And that's going to be the good news dimension of what we need to think about as we think of power in the   st century. There are ways to define our interests in which  while protecting ourselves with hard power  we can organize with others in networks to produce  not only public goods  but ways that will enhance our soft power. So if one looks at the statements that have been made about this  I am impressed that when Hillary Clinton described the foreign policy of the Obama administration  she said that the foreign policy of the Obama administration was going to be smart power  as she put it   using all the tools in our foreign policy tool box.  And if we're going to deal with these two great power shifts that I've described  the power shift represented by transition among states  the power shift represented by diffusion of power away from all states  we're going to have to develop a new narrative of power in which we combine hard and soft power into strategies of smart power. And that's the good news I have. We can do that. Thank you very much. Sustainability represents the what  the where and the how of what is caught. The who and the why are what's important to me. I want to know the people behind my dinner choices. I want to know how I impact them. I want to know how they impact me. I want to know why they fish. I want to know how they rely on the water's bounty for their living. Understanding all of this enables us to shift our perception of seafood away from a commodity to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem. It allows for us to celebrate the seafood that we're also so fortunate to eat. So what do we call this  I think we call it restorative seafood. Where sustainability is the capacity to endure and maintain  restorative is the ability to replenish and progress. Restorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system and acknowledges our relationship with the ocean as a resource  suggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean and to encourage its resiliency. It is a more hopeful  it is a more human  and is a more useful way of understanding our environment. Wallet guides    standard issue by lots in the marine conservation world    are very handy  they're a wonderful tool. Green  yellow and red lists  of  seafood species. The association is very easy  buy green  don't buy red  think twice about yellow. But in my mind  it's really not enough to just eat green list. We can't sustain this without the measure of our success really changing the fate of the species in the yellow and the red. But what if we eat only in the green list  You've got pole caught yellowfin tuna here    comes from sustainable stocks. Pole caught    no bycatch. Great for fishermen. Lots of money. Supporting local economies. But it's a lion of the sea. It's a top predator. What's the context of this meal  Am I sitting down in a steakhouse to a    ounce portion of this  Do I do this three times a week  I might still be in the green list  but I'm not doing myself  or you  or the oceans any favors. The point is that we have to have a context  a gauge for our actions in all this. Example  I've heard that red wine is great for my health    antioxidants and minerals    heart healthy. That's great  I love red wine  I'm going to drink so much of it. I'm going to be so healthy. Well  how many bottles is it before you tell me that I have a problem  Well folks  we have a protein problem. We have lost this sensibility when it regards our food  and we are paying a cost. The problem is we are hiding that cost beneath the waves. We are hiding that cost behind the social acceptance of expanding waistlines. And we are hiding that cost behind monster profits. So the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood is that it really takes into account our needs. Restorative seafood might best be represented not by Jaws  or by Flipper  or the Gordon's fisherman  but rather  by the Jolly Green Giant. Vegetables  they might yet save the oceans. Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green. Well I'd like to respectfully submit that broccoli green might then be the new blue. We must continue to eat the best seafood possible  if at all. But we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables. The best part about restorative seafood though is that it comes on the half shell with a bottle of Tabasco and lemon wedges. It comes in a five ounce portion of tilapia breaded with Dijon mustard and crispy  broiled breadcrumbs and a steaming pile of pecan quinoa pilaf with crunchy  grilled broccoli so soft and sweet and charred and smoky on the outside with just a hint of chili flake. Whooo  This is an easy sell. And the best part is all of those ingredients are available to every family at the neighborhood Walmart. Jamie Oliver is campaigning to save America from the way we eat. Sylvia is campaigning to save the oceans from the way we eat. There's a pattern here. Forget nuclear holocaust  it's the fork that we have to worry about. We have ravaged our Earth and then used the food that we've sourced to handicap ourselves in more ways than one. So I think we have this whole eating thing wrong. And so I think it's time we change what we expect from our food. Sustainability is complicated but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand. So let's start there. There's been a lot of movement recently in greening our food systems. Dan Barber and Alice Waters are leading passionately the green food Delicious Revolution. But green foods often represent a way for us to disregard the responsibility as eaters. Just because it comes from a green source doesn't mean we can treat it with disregard on the plate. We have eco friendly shrimp. We can make them  we have that technology. But we can never have any eco friendly all you can eat shrimp buffet. It doesn't work. Heart healthy dinner is a very important part of restorative seafood. While we try to manage declining marine populations  the media's recommending increased consumption of seafood. Studies say that tens of thousands of American grandmothers  grandfathers  mothers and fathers might be around for another birthday if we included more seafood. That's a reward I am not willing to pass up. But it's not all about the seafood. It's about the way that we look at our plates. As a chef  I realize the easiest thing for me to do is reduce the portion sizes on my plate. A couple things happened. I made more money. People started buying appetizers and salads  because they knew they weren't going to fill up on the entrees alone. People spent more time engaging in their meals  engaging with each other over their meals. People got  in short  more of what they came there for even though they got less protein. They got more calories over the course of a diversified meal. They got healthier. I made more money. This is great. Environmental consideration was served with every plate  but it was served with a heaping mound of consideration for human interests at the same time. One of the other things we did was begin to diversify the species that we served    small silverfish  anchovies  mackerel  sardines were uncommon. Shellfish  mussels  oysters  clams  tilapia  char    these were the common species. We were directing tastes towards more resilience  more restorative options. This is what we need to favor. This is what the green list says. But this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment. But what of those big predators  those fashionable species  that green list tuna that I was talking about earlier  Well  if you must  I have a recipe for you. It pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean  so here we go. Start with a    ounce portion of big fish. Get a knife. Cut it into four portions. Put it on four plates. Mound up those four plates with vegetables and then open up the very best bottle of Burgundy you have  light the candles and celebrate it. Celebrate the opportunity you have to eat this. Invite your friends and neighbors over and repeat once a year  maybe. I expect a lot from food. I expect health and joy and family and community. I expect that producing ingredients  preparing dishes and eating meals is all part of the communion of human interests. I was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook. And he taught me very early on about the privilege that eating represents. I remember well the meals of my childhood. They were reasonable portions of protein served with copious quantities of vegetables and small amounts of starch  usually rice. This is still how I largely eat today. I get sick when I go to steakhouses. I get the meat sweats. It's like a hangover from protein. It's disgusting. But of all the dire news that you'll hear and that you have heard about the state of our oceans  I have the unfortunate burden of delivering to you possibly the very worst of it and that is this whole time your mother was right. Eat your vegetables. It's pretty straightforward. So what are we looking for in a meal  Well for health  I'm looking for wholesome ingredients that are good for my body. For joy  I'm looking for butter and salt and sexy things that make things taste less like penance. For family  I'm looking for recipes that genuflect to my own personal histories. For community though  we start at the very beginning. There's no escaping the fact that everything we eat has a global impact. So try and learn as best you can what that impact is and then take the first step to minimize it. We've seen an image of our blue planet  our world bank. But it is more than just a repository of our resources  it's also the global geography of the communion we call dinner. So if we all take only what we need  then we can begin to share the rest  we can begin to celebrate  we can begin to restore. We need to savor vegetables. We need to savor smaller portions of seafood. And we need to save dinner. Thank you. I'm a bug lover  myself    not from childhood  by the way  but rather late. When I bachelored  majoring in zoology in Tel Aviv University  I kind of fell in love with bugs. And then  within zoology  I took the course or the discipline of entomology  the science of insects. And then I thought  myself  how can I be practical or help in the science of entomology  And then I moved to the world of plant protection    plant protection from insects  from bad bugs. And then within plant protection  I came into the discipline of biological pest control which we actually define as the use of living organisms to reduce populations of noxious plant pests. So it's a whole discipline in plant protection that's aiming at the reduction of chemicals. And biological pest control  by the way  or these good bugs that we are talking about  they've existed in the world for thousands and thousands of years  for a long  long time. But only in the last     years people started  or people knew more and more how to exploit  or how to use  this biological control phenomenon  or in fact  natural control phenomenon  to their own needs. Because biological control phenomenon  you can see it in your backyard. Just take a magnifying glass. You see what I have here  That's a magnifier times   . Yeah  times   . Just open it. You just twist leaves  and you see a whole new world of minute insects  or little spiders of one millimeter  one and a half  two millimeters long  and you can distinguish between the good ones and the bad ones. So this phenomenon of natural control exists literally everywhere. Here  in front of this building  I'm sure. Just have a look at the plants. So it's everywhere  and we need to know how to exploit it. Well let us go hand by hand and browse through just a few examples. What is a pest  What damage  does  it actually inflict on the plant  And what is the natural enemy  the biologically controlled agent  or the good bug  that we are talking about  In general  I'm going to talk about insects and spiders  or mites  let us call them. Insects  those six legged organisms and spiders or mites  the eight legged organisms. Let's have a look at that. Here is a pest  devastating pest  a spider mite  because it does a lot of webbing like a spider. You see the mother in between and two daughters  probably on the left and right  and a single egg on the right hand side. And then you see what kind of damage it can inflict. On your right hand side you can see a cucumber leaf  and on the middle  cotton leaf  and on the left a tomato leaf with these little stipplings. They can literally turn from green to white because of the sucking  piercing mouthparts of those spiders. But here comes nature that provides us with a good spider. This is a predatory mite    just as small as a spider mite  by the way  one millimeter  two millimeters long  not more than that  running quickly  hunting  chasing the spider mites. And here you can see this lady in action on your left hand side    just pierces  sucks the body fluids on the left hand side of the pest mite. And after five minutes  this is what you see  just a typical dead corpse  shriveled  sucked out  dead corpse of the spider mite  and next to it  two satiated individuals of predatory mites  a mother on the left hand side  a young nymph on the right hand side. By the way  a meal for them for    hours is about five individuals of the spider mites  of the bad mites  or    to    eggs of the pest mites. By the way  they are hungry always. And there is another example  aphids. By the way  it's springtime now in Israel. When temperature rises sharply  you can see those bad ones  those aphids  all over the plants  in your hibiscus  in your lantana  in the young  fresh foliage of the spring flush  so called. By the way  with aphids you have only females  like Amazons. Females giving rise to females giving rise to other females. No males at all. Parthenogenesis   as it  was so called. And they are very happy with that  apparently. Here we can see the damage. Those aphids secrete some sticky  sugary liquid called honeydew  and this just globs the upper parts of the plant. Here you see a typical cucumber leaf that turned actually from green to black because of a black fungus  sooty mold  which is covering it. And here comes the salvation through this parasitic wasp. Here we are not talking about a predator. Here we are talking a parasite    not a two legged parasite  but an eight legged parasite  of course. This is a parasitic wasp  again  two millimeters long  slender  a very quick and sharp flier. And here you can see this parasite in action  like in an acrobatic maneuver. She stands vis a vis in front of the victim at the right hand side  bending its abdomen and inserting a single egg  a single egg into the body fluids of the aphid. By the way  the aphid tries to escape. She kicks and bites and secretes different liquids  but nothing will happen  in fact. Only the egg of the parasite will be inserted into the body fluids of the aphid. And after a few days  depending upon temperature  the egg will hatch and the larva of this parasite will eat the aphid from the inside. This is all natural. This is all natural. This is not fiction  nothing at all. Again  in your backyard  in your backyard. But this is the end result. This is the end result  Mummies    M U M M Y. This is the visual result of a dead aphid encompassing inside  in fact  a developing parasitoid that after a few minutes you see halfway out. The birth is almost complete. You can see  by the way  in different movies  etc.  it takes just a few minutes. And if this is a female  she'll immediately mate with a male and off she goes because time is very short. This female can live only three to four days  and she needs to give rise to around     eggs. That means she has     bad aphids to put her eggs into their body fluids. And this is of course not the end of it. There is a whole wealth of other natural enemies and this is just the last example. Again  we'll start first with the pest  the thrips. By the way  all these weird names    I didn't bother you with the Latin names of these creatures  okay  just the popular names. But this is a nice  slender  very bad pest. If you can see this  sweet peppers. This is not just an exotic  ornamental sweet pepper. This is a sweet pepper which is not consumable because it is suffering from a viral disease transmitted by those thrip adults. And here comes the natural enemy  minute pirate bug   minute  because it is rather small. Here you can see the adult  black  and two young ones. And again  in action. This adult pierces the thrips  sucking it within just several minutes  just going to the other prey  continuing all over the place. And if we spread those minute pirate bugs  the good ones  for example  in a sweet pepper plot  they go to the flowers. And look  this flower is flooded with predatory bugs  with the good ones after wiping out the bad ones  the thrips. So this is a very positive situation  by the way. No harm to the developing fruit. No harm to the fruit set. Everything is just fine under these circumstances. But again  the question is  here you saw them on a one to one basis    the pest  the natural enemy. What we do is actually this. In Northeast Israel  in Kibbutz Sde Eliyahu  there is a facility that mass produces those natural enemies. In other words  what we do there  we amplify  we amplify the natural control  or the biological control phenomenon. And in        square meters of state of the art greenhouses  there  we are mass producing those predatory mites  those minute pirate bugs  those parasitic wasps  etc.  etc. Many different parts. By the way  they have a very nice landscape    you see the Jordanian Mountains on the one hand and the Jordan Valley on the other hand  and a good  mild winter and a nice  hot summer  which is an excellent condition to mass produce those creatures. And by the way  mass production    it is not genetic manipulation. There are no GMOs    Genetically Modified Organisms    whatsoever. We take them from nature  and the only thing that we do  we give them the optimal conditions  under the greenhouses or in the climate rooms  in order to proliferate  multiply and reproduce. And that's what we get  in fact. You see under a microscope. You see in the upper left corner  you see a single predatory mite. And this is the whole bunch of predatory mites. You see this ampoule. You see this one. I have one gram of those predatory mites. One gram's        individuals         individuals are good enough to control one acre        square meters  of a strawberry plot against spider mites for the whole season of almost one year. And we can produce from this  believe you me  several dozens of kilograms on an annual basis. So this is what I call amplification of the phenomenon. And no  we do not disrupt the balance. On the contrary  because we bring it to every cultural plot where the balance was already disrupted by the chemicals. Here we come with those natural enemies in order to reverse a little bit of the wheel and to bring more natural balance to the agricultural plot by reducing those chemicals. That's the whole idea. And what is the impact  In this table  you can actually see what is an impact of a successful biological control by good bugs. For example  in Israel  where we employ more than       hectares           dunams in Israeli terms    of biological pest controlling sweet pepper under protection     percent of the pesticides were actually reduced. And Israeli strawberries  even more       percent of the pesticides  especially those aimed against pest mites in strawberries. So the impact is very strong. And there goes the question  especially if you ask growers  agriculturists  Why biological control  Why good bugs  By the way  the number of answers you get equals the number of people you ask. But if we go  for example  to this place  Southeast Israel  the Arava area above the Great Rift Valley  where the really top notch    the pearl of the Israeli agriculture is located  especially under greenhouse conditions  or under screenhouse conditions    if you drive all the way to Eilat  you see this just in the middle of the desert. And if you zoom in  you can definitely watch this  grandparents with their grandchildren  distributing the natural enemies  the good bugs  instead of wearing special clothes and gas masks and applying chemicals. So safety  with respect to the application  this is the number one answer that we get from growers  why biological control. Number two  many growers are in fact petrified from the idea of resistance  that the pests will become resistant to the chemicals  just in our case that bacteria becomes resistant to antibiotics. It's the same  and it can happen very quickly. Fortunately  in either biological control or even natural control  resistance is extremely rare. It hardly happens. Because this is evolution  this is the natural ratio  unlike resistance  which happens in the case of chemicals. And thirdly  public demand. Public demand    the more the public demands the reduction of chemicals  the more growers become aware of the fact they should  wherever they can and wherever possible  replace the chemical control with biological control. Even here  there is another grower  you see  very interested in the bugs  the bad ones and the good ones  wearing this magnifier already on her head  just walking safely in her crop. Finally  I want to get actually to my vision  or in fact  to my dream. Because  you see  this is the reality. Have a look at the gap. If we take the overall turnover of the biocontrol industry worldwide  it's     million dollars. And look at the overall pesticide industry in all the crops throughout the world. I think it's times     or something like that. Twenty five billion. So there is a huge gap to bridge. So actually  how can we do it  How can we bridge  or let's say  narrow  this gap in the course of the years  First of all  we need to find more robust  good and reliable biological solutions  more good bugs that we can either mass produce or actually conserve in the field. Secondly  to create even more intensive and strict public demand to reduction of chemicals in the agricultural fresh produce. And thirdly  also to increase awareness by the growers to the potential of this industry. And this gap really narrows. Step by step  it does narrow. So I think my last slide is  All we are saying  we can actually sing it  Give nature a chance. So I'm saying it on behalf of all the biocontrol petitioners and implementers  in Israel and abroad  really give nature a chance. Thank you.
